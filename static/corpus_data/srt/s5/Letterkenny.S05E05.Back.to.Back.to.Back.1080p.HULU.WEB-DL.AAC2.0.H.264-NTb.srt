1
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:13,633
We went shopping for a whiskey
night the other day.

2
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,766
That's a big fuck‐off bottle
of Gus N' Bru.

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,633
It's better to be looking
at it then looking
for it.

4
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:23,933
You boys getting
into it tonight?

5
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:25,666
Yeah, it's a Texas‐sized
ten‐four.

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,233
That's a Texas‐sized
two‐six.

7
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:30,366
That's a Texas Micky,
super shooters,
let's get cracking.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,866
Wayne.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,033
What's the problem,
Katy?

10
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,133
It happened again.
What did?

11
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,633
Gus left a Mr. Big
on the floor
this morning.

12
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:38,966
No, he never.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,400
He dropped a Hershey bar
in the living room
just last Tuesday,

14
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:43,700
although upon closer inspection,
it did look more like
a Hershey's mint.

15
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:45,833
Well, I'd sooner believe
that was you, Squirrelly Dan.

16
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:47,633
So watch how
you speak on his name,
you know?

17
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,400
Hey, buddy... He left
a Twix on the floor
just yesterday.

18
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:53,033
And what made it a Twix
as opposed to a Big Turk, Dary?

19
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:55,366
Well, there were
two of 'em.

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,133
They're identical,
and they're side
by each.

21
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,300
Over and out.
How would you ask somebody
if you wanted just

22
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,266
one of their Twix's?

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,866
Well, just what you said.
"Can I have one of your Twix's?"

24
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,333
No, it'd be...
"Could I have a Twick?"

25
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:08,333
In any event, it's starting
to look like Willy Wonka's
emptying his pockets

26
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:09,500
around your house,
good buddy.

27
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:12,000
Now, you's realize
the weight of
these allegations.

28
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:13,166
These accusations.

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,666
Can confirm.

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,000
And you's realize
the consequences at hand
should your claim be false.

31
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:19,133
Claims is's this.
Can confirm's.

32
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,366
I'll only give you's
one more chance
to retract.

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,066
No questions asked.

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,666
Before this conversation
becomes a confrontation.

35
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,400
We wouldn't be bringing it
to you if it weren't worth
being brought'en.

36
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:29,700
‐But...
‐Bring it on.

37
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:30,900
Oh, it has been broughten.

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,066
I'm just kidding around.

39
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,866
He's a ten‐year‐old boy, now.

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,166
He's made me proud
for a goddamn decade.

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,633
He's been a real good bo.

42
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,266
He's been such a bo.

43
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,633
But he's a senior now.

44
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,333
He's on the home stretch,
and I'm trying to let him
enjoy it.

45
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:49,033
Snoozin' on the furniture,
lots of human food.

46
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,666
Leash is so long now,
she's limp.

47
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,966
And he's earned it.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,900
So you're just gonna
let him drop Baby Ruth's
all over the house?

49
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:55,966
As opposed to what, Katy?

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,166
Just give him
a real good, stern
talking to.

51
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,800
Oh, yeah, and how's
that gonna shake down?

52
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,200
He's probably
half fuckin' deaf.

53
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,900
Aren't you,
you fuckin' geezer?

54
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:05,700
The same way it shook down
for the last decade before
you stopped disciplining him,

55
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:06,600
just 'cause he's old.

56
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:09,800
Okay, Katy.
Katy, okay, I'm going in.

57
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,766
Wish me luck.

58
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,633
All right, was that you
leaving Crispy Crunchers
all over the floor?

59
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,833
'Cause that's a bad dog,
don't you do that again,
that's bad.

60
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:20,000
Lickety‐split.

61
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,200
Ah, that's a wee bit
aggressive.

62
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:22,333
Oh is that what
I'm being, Dary?

63
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:23,600
Well, that's your pal
you're talking to over there,

64
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:26,200
fairly accusatory.
I'd say give him
benefit of the doubt.

65
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,700
I wouldn't.
Well, you didn't even ask
him if he did it there.

66
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,266
You just assumed,
I think you're better
than that.

67
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,833
Okay, Dary. Dary, okay,
I'm going back in,
wish me luck.

68
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,633
Aye.

69
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,733
Was that you leaving
Jersey Milks on the floor?

70
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:40,933
Because that's bad,
if that was you,
that was bad.

71
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:43,266
Don't you do that
again ever,
'cause I'll be there.

72
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:46,200
You're not taking
this seriously.

73
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,666
Oh, is that what
I'm not doing, Katy?

74
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,366
No, you're joking around
and he knows it.

75
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,900
It's, "Bad boy,
this is a bad boy."

76
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:55,000
Hey, he knows that
I'm joking but he doesn't
know that you're joking.

77
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:57,233
Don't say "bad"
unless you mean bad.

78
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:58,266
I'm sorry, Gus.

79
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,733
That's okay, he's a good boy,
he's such a boy.

80
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,700
Why don't you just try
using your real voice?
It may permeate better.

81
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:07,166
Okay, Katy. Katy, okay,
I'm going back in.

82
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,366
Wish me luck.

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,666
Hey, bud.

84
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,133
I noticed that you've
been leaving Caramilks
all over the floor,

85
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,700
you know what's gonna
happen? Someone's gonna
step on one in the night

86
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:17,366
and take a header,
someone's gonna pull
a full gainer down the stairs.

87
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,166
Or at the very least,
a half gainer.

88
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,933
So what you wanna do
is do that outside
like a good boy.

89
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:23,033
Please and thanks.

90
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:24,866
I thinks we're almost there.

91
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,366
Oh, is that where
we almost are, Squirrelly Dan?

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,366
Now, Professor Tricia says
that when you're bringing
a complaints to someone,

93
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,833
they'll be more receptive
to altering their behavior

94
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:33,100
if you make it
your problem.

95
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:36,200
Make it personal
rather than placing
the blames on them.

96
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:38,333
What are you fuckin'
getting on about
over there?

97
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:40,866
May I's?
Okay, Dan. Dan, okay.

98
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,300
Go on in, good luck.

99
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,400
Gus, how are you now?

100
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,100
Now, we've all noticed
the Coffee Crisps around
the house,

101
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:51,833
and that's completely
natural and nothing for youse
to be embarrassed about.

102
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:54,933
But I am quite worried
I am going to slip on one
and take a full gainer,

103
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:57,000
or... Please look
at me when I'm talking, Gus.

104
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:59,066
Now, while I know
that that is my problem,

105
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,400
I know you don't want
this to happen any more
than I do.

106
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:05,066
So I'm hoping we can
works together to find
a resolution to this problem.

107
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,866
But besides that, we want you
to know, we think you're doing
a terrific job around here

108
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,033
and we don't want
to bothers you anymore
than we needs to,

109
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:13,966
so you have yourself
a great day.

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,800
I'm not going to make you
sit through that butt‐fuckery,
Bud, away you go.

111
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,266
You're a good boy,
away you go.

112
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,533
Away you go.

113

Look, I know he's just
snoozing on the furniture
all day,

114
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:25,400
but you take him out
for routine number twos.

115
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,433
Ten‐four?

116
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,733
You try taking him out,
Katy, he don't wanna.

117
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:30,466
You can say,
"Hey, Gus,
wanna rock one?"

118
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,633
And if he could talk,
he'd say, "I've had to rock one
for a good seven, eight hours.

119
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,133
"Don't worry about
that right now.

It has come to our attention
that there may be a young man
who has come between you girls.

I mean...
How do you mean?

00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:21,300
Well, Betty‐Anne,
Mary‐Anne.

134
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,266
We were told that you
may be going for
the same guy.

Or, or that the same
guy may be going
for both of you.

Impossible.
How do you mean?

The last guy that was
into Mary‐Anne was the priest
at Catholic school in grade six.

138
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,866
And only 'cause he thought
she was a boy.
