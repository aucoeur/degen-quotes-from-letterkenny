00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,675
You're having a conversation
about your pal's second cousin.

KATY: Who, Jarret?
DAN: No, Garrets.

4
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:17,875
He's a good guy.

5
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:19,441
He took me to the movies
in grade six,

6
00:00:19,475 --> 00:00:20,608
and he wouldn't
hold my hand.

7
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:21,808
A young man's hands
can get sweaty

8
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:23,441
in that sort of situation.

9
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:25,441
Then put your arm around me,
what's the problem?

10
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:28,008
Anywho, Garrett's movings down
to Los Angeles

11
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,541
to try to be an actors.

12

He's winning for
the weather alone.

13
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:32,975
Negative. It shouldn't
be warm all the time.

14
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:34,875
Four seasons helps
keep a man regular.

15
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:36,441
Like a bowl of brans
in the mornin'.

16
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:38,875
Huh.

17
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:40,641
Garrett's moving down to LA

18
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:42,975
to be an actor.

19
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,775
Isn't that something
you just kind of are?

20
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:46,108
It's not as if a librarian

21
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:49,008
can just call themselves
a librarian without
collecting a paycheck.

22
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,408
They got to work.

23
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:52,008
That's correct, Ms. Katys.

24
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,808
So Garrett is moving down
to Los Angeles

25
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:56,075
to try to earn a livings
as an actor.

26
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:57,708
Can you do that?
Do whats?

27
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:00,408
Well, earn a living
as an actor.

28
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:02,808
That's a thing?
Sure it is.

29
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:05,575
So, you can earn a living
as an actor, you say?

30
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:07,808
Yeah. How do you think Brad Pitt
bought all those paintings

31
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:09,808
and became so passionates
about architecture?

32
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:13,441
I would smash that dude
with a category five hurricane
off the coast.

33
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:16,075
DARYL: Huh, Garrett's going
to LA to make a living
as an actor?

a boat, buddy.
Yeah, buddy.

157
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:39,341
Then come on,

158
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,075
let's win a fuckin' sea liner.

159
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,875
Let's win
a Great Lakes freighter.

Let's win a cable ferry.

Wait!

177
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,441
You're gonna need
an ice‐breaker.

178
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:28,608
Tanis, how are you now?

(SPITS)

180
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:31,975
What?

181
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:33,041
What...
What?

182
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:35,441
...the actual fuck was that?

183
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:37,041
What?
Well, you're standing,

184
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:39,675
breathing, and smoking,
so the other thing,

185
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:41,675
The spitting?

186
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,708
Some barefaced,
uncultivated version
of it, yes.

187
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:46,475
What, you never seen
someone spit before?

188
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:49,841
Yes, an inexcusably obese man
in the batter's box

189
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:50,975
at a Blue Jays game.

190
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:52,441
But you never seen
a girl spit before.

191
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:56,975
Yes, a six‐year‐old, after
consuming an insect
in her ice‐cream cone.

192
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:58,641
But you don't think
girls should spit.

193
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:00,375
I don't say what girls
should do.

194
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:02,875
(CHUCKLES)
But you don't like it
when girls spit.

195
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:05,908
Preferably not within
my line of sight, earshot,

196
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:07,608
and in a perfect world, ever.

You hungry?
Am I hungry?

199
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:16,108
Yeah, that's what I said.

200
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:19,408
I'm immediately concerned
that sensation may never
reestablish itself,

201
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:20,675
but what a ride it's been.

202
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,008
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

203
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,275
What is this, the 1950s?

204
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:25,741
You want me to go borrow
an ankle‐length skirt
from my auntie?

205
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,475
Come on.
I cooked for you.

206
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:30,508

He was supposed to be here
over an hour ago. Try him again.

210
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:43,741
Stewart, I just tried him.

211
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,575
And?
Straight to voicemail.

212
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:47,008
Aggravating.
Stewart!

213
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,508
Agitating.
Stewart!

214
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,675
Alarming.

00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:54,541
I think...

218
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,308
I may have a problem.

219
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:57,475
No. No!

I'm in over my head!
We all want it.

I have no control!
We all need it!

(SHOUTS)
Then where is it?

223
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,041
Right here.

00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,675
(BOTH REPEATING) Get it out!
Give it to me.

225
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,375
I've got it!
It's all right here.

226
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:12,041
But you guys got meth, right?

227
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,708
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

228
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:15,508
The drugs are
all over there.

229
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,941
Just bring me that computer
and get us to the Dark Web.

230
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:20,908
First the meth,
then the Dark Web.

231

Roald.
You want some, too?

232
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:24,308
I'm good.

233
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:28,575
Bring me the Dark Web
over to my stand‐up desk.

234
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:32,475
Why do you have
a stand‐up desk?

235
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:34,641
Because sitting is
quietly murdering you.

236
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:39,575
Actually, yes, Roald, I...
I will have some meth.

237
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:45,475
And here we are.

238
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,575
The Dark Web.

239
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:49,408
Why do you guys crave
the Dark Web so much?

240
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:50,708
Because the Dark Web
is exclusive.

241
00:08:50,741 --> 00:08:52,541
The Dark Web
is only accessible

242
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:53,908
using special software,

243
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:56,475

and anonymous
on the Dark Web.

245
00:08:58,075 --> 00:08:59,808
You can hire a hitman
on the Dark Web.

246
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:01,675
Purchase illegal contraband
on the Dark Web.

247
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,641
Sell illegal contraband
on the Dark Web.

248
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:05,075
Or you could join
a rebel army.

249
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:07,575
Or you could build a bomb
for your own rebel army
on the Dark Web.

The thrill of having

I don't like these mutts.

We could ignore
the call.
Oh, Stewart!

Let's ignore the call.

264

But how are we gonna
find cool new things
to do on the Dark Web,

265
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,075
unless we make
cool new pals
on the Dark Web.

Fine,

267

anything to keep
the Dark Web sustainable.

268

so, the other thing.

To borrow a phrase from
my stance on social media,

276
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,441
I don't follow.

278
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:14,808
Yeah, for a hot second,
to take my boots off.

279
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:16,808
Boots or no boots,
don't you think it's
a little fruity loops

280
00:10:16,841 --> 00:10:17,908
for a man to be
sitting like that?

281
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:19,508
On the contrary,

282
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:23,075
I'm sitting like this because
the less bending over
a man does, the better.

Hmm.

00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:54,575
Not a single cow was
photographed that day,

316
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:57,308
and yet they're
serving burgers? Gotcha.

317
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,008
Now McDonald's openly...

320
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,608
Fast‐forward, 2016, Donald Trump
is elected to office,

321
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:13,541
inherits the highest percentage
per capita of cannibals

322
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:15,708
in the world.

323
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:18,608
The left‐wing, fake news,
pinko media

324
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:19,875
wants you to think that he spent

325
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:22,641
16 of his first 100 days
in office golfing.

326
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,708
Wrong. Wrong!

327
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:27,808
Donald J. Trump spent 16
of his first 100 days,

328
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:29,741
as President of
the United States,

329
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:30,941
Commander‐in‐Chief,

330
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:33,508
leader of the goddamned
free world,

331
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,375
getting that per capita
percentage of cannibals

332
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:39,308
down from 100 to... Everett?

333
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,508
Uh... 13%?

334
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,875
That's right. Do the math.

335
00:12:44,908 --> 00:12:47,041
No, no, actually do...
Actually do the math.

336
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:48,575
Do the meth?

337
00:12:48,608 --> 00:12:49,775
We did the meth.

338
00:12:49,808 --> 00:12:51,341
(EXHALES SHAKILY)

339
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:55,475
Listen, uh, friend.

340
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,941
We've been listening to you
ramble for an hour.

341
00:12:57,975 --> 00:13:01,041
We only joined the Dark Web
to see cool new things,

342
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:02,875
and join cool
new movements.

343
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,275
And make
cool new pals.

344
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:09,375
Cool new pals, you say?

345
00:13:09,408 --> 00:13:10,441
Yes.
No.

346
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:11,608

347
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:14,375
<i>I know how you can make</i>
<i>all the coolest new pals ever.</i>

348
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:15,975
Spare us the hyperbole.

349
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:17,375
How?

350
00:13:17,408 --> 00:13:18,841
Join the Hard Right!

351
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:23,708
I said that like that was
leading into another monologue,

352
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:26,408
but it's really just...
Just joi... Join the Hard Right.

356
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:35,575
I... I designed it.

357
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:43,941
Mmm.

358
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:47,208
Eat up. You're gonna need
fuel for later. (CHUCKLES)

What...
What?

362
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:56,008
...the actual fuck
was that now?

363
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:56,941
What now?

364
00:13:56,975 --> 00:13:59,241
Well, you're sitting, eating,
and breathing,

365
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:00,308
so, the other thing.

366
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,875
Burping?
Yes.

367
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,175
Some primitive,
distressing version of it

368
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,875
That was nothing.
Terrific.

369
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:08,941
You can burp, too.
Outstanding.

370
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:10,841
You can fucking fart,
if you want.

371
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,275
You know why?
Because it's normal.

372
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:13,575
But is it fashionable?

373
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:14,841
It's becoming...

374
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,241
It's unbecoming.

375
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:18,275
Well, your boyfriend Daryl

376
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:19,908
burps and spits.

377
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:21,908
Dary also chases ducks,

378
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,075
draws on the walls,

379
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:25,108
and must be told
not to taste or touch

380
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:26,208
everything he sees.

381
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,475
That's true.

382
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:28,541
So, is it because I'm a lady?

383
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:29,775
Who's a lady?

384
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:33,175
So, what, you're saying that
girls shouldn't burp, too?

385
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,275
I don't say
what girls should do.

386
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,008
Well, men shouldn't
shackle women.

387

We made Prohibition happen,
watch your step.

That ship's clear
across the pond.

391
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:44,908
Same. Let's go make a fire

392
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:46,241
'cause it's a beautiful
fucking day.

393
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:47,908
Is that what it is?
What?

394
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,541
Hmm?

Coast Guard Zodiacs
at our fingertips.

398
00:14:56,908 --> 00:14:58,008
But full disclosure,

399
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,241
this team's got a bit of
an attitude problem, all right?

400
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,808
Little battle of leadership
going on in here.

401
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:05,275
All right? Sure, they got their
center console skiffs,

402
00:15:05,308 --> 00:15:08,041
but they went through a lot
of coaches in the process.

403
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,141
(SCOFFS)
Mundane details, boys.

404
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,275
We want
a twin engine jet boat.

405
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:11,575
We want that cruise ship.

406
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:14,375
That's the attitude, pylons.
Now get in there.

407
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:15,408
All right.

(REILLY EXCLAIMS)

410
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:23,141
What are you two doing?

411
00:15:23,175 --> 00:15:24,941
Sorry, boys... Ladies.

412
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:26,341
We didn't know
you were ladies, boys.

413
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,275
Um... Not ladyboys. We didn't
know you were ladies.

414
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:30,508
Do you think the door is open
to everyone here?

415
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,308
Just because Mary‐Anne
looks like she's homeless,

416
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:34,141
doesn't mean you can
treat it like a shelter.

417
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:35,508
Fuck you, Betty‐Anne.

418
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,575
But she's right.

419
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:38,341
Door isn't open
to everybody here.

420
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,375
Just because our mitt looks
like the back of Christ's head,

421
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:42,108
doesn't mean you can treat
it like a church.

422
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,341
Fuck you, Mary‐Anne.

423
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,308
Your mitt looks like Babe Ruth's
ball glove from the dirty '30s

424
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:49,141
if 20 more dudes spat
chewing tobacco in it.

425
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:51,508
Your mitt's actually
a work of art, Betty‐Anne.

426
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,208
Like Salvador Dali's
melting clocks,

427
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:57,108
but instead of melting clocks,
it's melting salad bowls

428
00:15:57,141 --> 00:15:58,375
of off‐pink ice‐cream.

429
00:15:58,408 --> 00:16:01,141
Hmm. I love ice‐cream,
Mary‐Anne.

430
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:02,841
I love all frozen treats.

431
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:07,308

a cherry‐red popsicle with
a handful of dryer lint.

Meet your new team, pheasants.

You serious with
that turtleneck?

You mean, cold?

437
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:21,241
I wouldn't say
I'm hot, but...

438
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:23,408
Ugh. Most men I know
wouldn't complain about
something like that.

439
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,308
You see the elephant?

440
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:30,541
You mean next to
the bus crash?

441

That's the one.
Yeah, I see it.

442
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,108
You wanna talk about it?

443
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:34,141
Let's talk about it.

444
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:36,841
A woman can be what she wants.

445
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,375
That is so nice of you
to allow that.

446
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:39,508
Not what I meant.
I'm kidding.

447
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,908
A woman should be
what she wants.

448
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:43,475
Better.

449
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:46,175
There's no definition
of a woman.

450
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,808
It's the same as a man,
there's no definition...

451
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,275
No need to womansplain,
I'm aware.

452
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:53,575
But a woman should be with
a man she finds...desirable.

453
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:55,575
And vice versa.

454
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:57,341
Like, long‐term,
like in a relationship.

455
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,375
Can't confirm.

456
00:16:59,941 --> 00:17:01,108
I don't think
you're it, cowboy.

457
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:03,008
Oh, you think?
(CHUCKLES) I know.

458
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,508
Good enough.
Good stuff.

459
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,375
A short‐term...

460

(CLEARS THROAT)
on the other hand...

461
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:10,408
How short?

462
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:11,975
A night.
A night?

463
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:13,541
An hour?

464
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:15,875
Maybe more than an hour.

465
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:17,241
A night.
A night.

466
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:18,341
Maybe even a morning.

467
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,441
Maybe even a morning.

468
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:20,441
'Cause we didn't do
all the things I wanted to do.

469
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:22,508
Well, we talked,
we ate...
It was good, right?

470
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,008
Thank you for supper.
My pleasure.

471
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,208
We talked, we ate,

472
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:26,408
we sat by the fire.

473
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:27,575
So, then the other thing.

474
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:29,141
Good enough.
Good stuff.

475
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:30,175
(SNIFFLES)

476
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:43,941
Just kiddin'! (CHUCKLES)

477
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:54,175
DARYL: Fifteen‐two,

478
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,775
Fifteen‐four,
the rest don't score.

479
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,775
Runs of threes,
that's its for me's.

480
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:02,175
Youse been playin'

00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,275
How'd it go, big brother?

482
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:04,341
Do you all know what,

483
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,608
aside from the end there,

484
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:06,875

485
00:18:06,908 --> 00:18:08,475
Called it.
How poorly?

486
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:09,541
So poor.

487
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:10,808
He said, so fuckin' poor.

488
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,375
Talkin' about ultra poor.

489
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:13,808
Called it.
What did I miss?

490
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:15,275
BOTH: Taco night.

491
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:17,175
KATY: But not just
any taco night.

492
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,541
(IN LA ACCENT) LA taco night.

493
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:21,308
(MOCKINGLY)
Oh, there's no taco night
like an "LA" taco night.

494
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:23,308
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah.
You've never had taco night

495
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:25,308
unless you've had
an "LA" taco night.

496
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:27,508
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah. Well,
if it's taco night in "LA",

497
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,208
then you must have had a hike.
Did youse have a hike?

498
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,408
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah.

499
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:32,708
You can't have taco night
in "LA" without havin' a hike.

500
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:34,441
(IN LA ACCENT) Oh, yeah.
We had an LA hike,

501
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:36,808
but it was so cold,
it gets so cold in LA.

502
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:39,141
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah.
It's a deserts, don't you know?

503
00:18:39,175 --> 00:18:41,508
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah.
It gets just as cold in "LA".

504
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,408
It's just a different kind
of cold in "LA".

505
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:44,908
(MOCKINGLY) Pull your finger
out of your ass.

506
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:46,441
(MOCKINGLY) That's what I say,
I said pull your finger
out of your ass,

507
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:47,775
you're from "LA".

508
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:51,141
(IN LA ACCENT) Oh, yeah.
You've got to take La Cienega
to La Tijera

509
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:53,375
if you're going to LAX in "LA".

510
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:55,808
(IN LA ACCENT) Oh, yeah.
I will have another
cold‐pressed juice

511
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:57,141
'cause we're in LA.

512
00:18:57,175 --> 00:18:59,441
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah.
I'm just poppin' down
to Trader Joe's

513
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:01,575
to load up on kombuchas in "LA".

514
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:04,441
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah. You can
stick your Hybrid Toyotas
straight up your ass,

515
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:06,541
it's all about Teslas
now in "LA".

516
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:09,141
(IN LA ACCENT) Oh, yeah.
It's like you could never
usually get a pizza

517
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:11,175
that was that good
in "LA" until now.

518
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,341
(IN LA ACCENT) Oh, yeah.
We're gonna have a winter brunch

519
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,241
outside on Melrose. (CHUCKLES)

520
00:19:15,275 --> 00:19:16,441
'Cause you can do that in LA.

521
00:19:16,475 --> 00:19:19,475
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah. I'm taking
improv classes at the UCBs,

522
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:22,308
but only until the groundlings
figure it out in "LA".

523
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:25,575
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, yeah. You better
get joined in a burlesque troupe
if you're going to "LA."

524
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:26,641
"LA".

525
00:19:26,675 --> 00:19:28,208
"LA".
"LA".

526
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:29,475
"LA"?
"LA".

527
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:30,775
"LA".
DAN: "LA".

528
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:32,275
"LA".
"LA".

529
00:19:32,308 --> 00:19:34,675
"LA"...

530
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,975
Pull your finger
out of your ass.

531
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,808
That's what I say,
I said pull your finger
out of your ass.

532
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:39,608
