with the same name as you?

157
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,400
Is it like,
"How fun"?

158
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:17,600
Or is it fucking weird?
It'd be fucking weird.

159
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:20,000
Quite likely.
That's never happened to me.

160
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:23,833
Guess the closest I ever came
to it was almost doing it
with a gal named Sheryl.

161
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:25,266
Yeah, I suppose
it'd kindsa be
like the time

162
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,366
I almost hooked up
with a gal who had
the same names as my Grandmas.

163
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,566
That would be
fucking off‐putting.

164
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,566
It was.
It was distracting
at inappropriate times...

165

a goddamn way
I could do it with a Katy.

Or a Kate
or a Caitlin.

169
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:42,966
I guess Katherine
would even be
walking the line.

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,400
There's no way
I could do it
with a Wayne.

Dr. Strangelove

310
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,866
or how I learned
to stop wearing,
"Love the Bum".

311
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:14,966
Bonnie and Pride.

312
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,366
ALL: Oh, Bonnie McMurray.

313
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,966
You boys tried
the catering yet?

314
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,566
I am chomping at the bit
to get one of those cupcakes.

315
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,066
Nots to be impolite,
Dary

316
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,000
but it's actually
champing at the bits.

317
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:28,366
Oh, you got those
pits ready for your
fucking ponies?

318
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,166
How many ponies you got
under your hood? You got
a frigging hemmy under there?

319
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,900
How many
CCs is your sled?

320
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:35,033
Do you fucking pin her
when you get pickled there, bud?

321
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:37,100
Oh, I really fucking gave it
to her last night.

322
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,833
Working hard
or hardly working?

323
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,366
What happened
to the part where...
We don't fight at weddings.

324
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,600
I gotta piss.
KATY: I'll come with you.

325
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,900
BONNIE: Yeah, same.
Okay, let's go. (CLEARS THROAT)

326
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,566
My cock he lives now.
(CHUCKLES)
Redux.

327
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,366
What's up,
ladies?

328
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,566
What is
your nationality?

329
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,933
Grow up
around here?

330
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:12,166
Have any tattoos?

331
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,066
I got a Celtic symbol
on my calf.

332
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,066
I got a Nike swoosh
right above my heart.

333
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,866
I got you a drink.
I swear it's not
a roofie.

334
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,300
Yes, it is.
Of course, it is.

335
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,966
Hey, that's
a real nice dress.

336
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,600
Look a lot nicer
on my hotel room floor.

337
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:26,833
You ever seen
the front seat
of a Honda del Sol?

338
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,200
I'll have a roll
in your hay any day.

339
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:31,100
We don't fight
at weddings.

340
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:33,333
I got a Harman Kardon
system in the 3.

341
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:36,466
X3.
BM motherfucking W,
baby.

342
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,200
It's actually
way better than Bose.

343
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,333
Dickskin?
Dickens.

344
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,866
Fellas, a list
of my requests.

345
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,933
To be played back two,
back two, three, four,
well I have five songs...

346
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,066
No requests.

347
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,066
How dare thou
come into
my private roost

348
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,000
of penetrating beats
with an audacious act
of social and musical treason.

349
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:09,200
Every single one of these
is a Brooks and Dunn song.

350
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,866
Starting with
the Boot Scootin' Boogie.

351
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,333
I didn't realize
they had other songs.

352
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:13,966
Of all the boogies,
the Boot Scootin'
is the last one I would

353
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,300
and will ever torture
myself or others with.

354
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,500
I'll give you
a Boot Scootin'.

355
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:20,033
What about
Blame It on the Boogie
by the Jackson 5?

356
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:21,566
Boogie, Oogie, Oogie,
A taste of honey.

357
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,466
Boot Scootin'.
Boogie Wonderland,
by Earth Wind & Fire

358
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,766
Elton John's
Street Boogie.

359
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,166
This wedding needs a boogie
and it's gonna be <i>Boot Scootin'.</i>

360
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,400
Born to Boogie,
T Rex?

361
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:29,966
Boogie Woogie Wu,
Insane Clown Posse.

362
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,366
Zip Gun Boogie,
T Rex again.

363
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,866
Take the damn boogie
and make it
a Boot Scootin'.

364
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,566
I'm Your Boogie Man,
KC and the Sunshine band.

365
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,500
I'm Your Boogieman,
White Zombie.

366
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:40,100
I hoped it wouldn't come
to blows over a boogie.

367
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,900
But I'll damn well
go to blows.

368
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,433
For the Boot Scootin' Boogie.

369
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,200
Not happening,
Dickskin.
Dickens!

370
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:55,966
I got it.
I got it.

371
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,333
I got the Chicken Dance.

372
00:15:57,366 --> 00:15:59,133
Went home and got it
out of the cassette player
in the tractor.

373
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,466
You play it now or later.
Either way, you'll play it.

374
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,866
Or you'll die.

375
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,133
What's with
the super sad
glassware, boys?

376
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,033
What's with your hair?

377
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:15,033
Oh, just got some
big city prospects.

378
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:17,300
Don't wanna risk
putting a big goose egg
up on the board.

379
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,033
Don't wanna fan
on a yonny cage, buddy.

380
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,033
So, we bruced up
our looks.

381
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,966
What does that mean?

382
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,533
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it, yeah.

383
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:27,133
How's that
going for ya?

384
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,966
Uh, good.
We got bites.

385
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:31,033
Yeah.

386
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,900
Well,
we got like, a...
A bite.

387
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,966
They were 50 though.

388
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,433
I took down
an older lady once.
It was kinda fun.

389
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,366
Kinda weird.
Why?

390
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,866
Well,
after she made a pizza.

391
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,400
Sick, buddy.
She ordered a pizza.

392
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:47,200
No, made a pizza.

393
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,166
From scratch, buddy.

394
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,466
I had to sit
and talk

395
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,900
while she made
a pizza.

396
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:55,233
You two
look like dandies.

397
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:56,266
You look
like pansies.

398
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,966
You know,
the landscape
might be changing

399
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,800
but manly men
never go out of style.

400
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,833
Hello, ladies.

401
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:11,066
Yeuch, I can't drink
this shit anymore.

402
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,266
What am I
a ballerina trying
to get skinny?

403
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,533
I'm gonna get
some rye, babe.

404
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,800
Cheers.

405
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,533
Katy got hit on
by a top hat guy.

406
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:25,333
A top hat.
A guy in a top hat.

407
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:28,333
I'd rather take down
a city than a guy
in a top hat.

408
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:29,366
Oh, I don't know,
Ms. Katys.

409
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,233
Some men looks
quite statelys
in a top hat.

410
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,933
Scrooge McDuck
comes to mind.

Uncle Pennybags
from Monopoly.
Willy Wonka's.

The Cat in the Hat.
Guy from T Rex again.

415
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,533
Oh, hey there,
buds.

416
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:46,866
Is she a manual?
Or are you driving
a bitch stick?

417
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,566
You like bud lite?
You like butt holes
around here.

418
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,366
Oh, did you get
your pecker stuck
in a bottle of brew?

419
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,533
Where's your sweety bud?

420
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:55,833
Did she leave you
to your John
and your John Deere?

421
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,533
Where's your John queer, bud?

422
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:06,400
I was brought up on
Looney Tunes and only dancing
when nobody's around.

423
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,166
Learned the heck
out of it that way, Dan.

424
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,333
I am fucking irritated.

425
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:10,966
We don't fight
at weddings.

426
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Right.

427
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:15,433
We don't fight
at weddings.

428
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:18,400
Ten four?
Over and out.

429
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,866
Hello, ladies.
Ladies.

430
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,033
Can we interest you
in a shot of sourpuss?

431
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:27,300
Perhaps a half glass
of white zinfandel?

432
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,500
Have you looked at
any interesting furniture
lately?

433
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:32,066
I admire his eye
for interior design.

434
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,200
What are you two
going on about?

435
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:34,566
You are really
missing the mark.

436
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,200
You know,
metrosexuality
went out of style

437
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,066
with the Von Dutch
and Chingy.

438
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,966
We are into men.
Classic men, athletic types.

439
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,166
You don't look like
you can fix my car.

440
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,133
You don't look
like you can fix
a sliding screen door.

441
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,400
What?
Wha... What?

442
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:50,233
We're ...
We're hockey players.

443
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,266
We're the snipe,
celly boys.

444
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,966
Dirty fucking
dangles boys.

445
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,366
What are you guys
going on about now?

446
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,966
Now you are
just being posers.
It's pretty pathetic.

447
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,466
Even if you are hockey players,
we are not puck bunnies.

448
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,333
Or lacrosse‐titutes.

449
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:07,433
I don't even drink...
I drink beer. (GROANS)

(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

451
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:27,466
Where are you guys
staying tonight?

452
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,233
There's only motel
in this shit hole,
so that one.

453
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:32,866
I've never ridden
in a BMW X3 before.

454
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,433
What about a BMW X3
with a luxury leather package?

455
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,466
She just said
she'd never ridden
in one, idiot.

456
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,166
Take me home.

00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,366
