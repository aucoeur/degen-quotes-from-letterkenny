1
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,633
Your friend Dary
said he can beat up

2
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,766
your friend Dan
the other day.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,866
WAYNE:
You're dreaming, bud.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,266
DARYL: Am not.
DAN: Are, too.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,166
You're Joseph
and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat, bud.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,733
All I'm saying is,
if it came down to it
and I hope it wouldn't...

7
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:24,200
Well, see you're soft
on it already, Dary.

8
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,366
I could beat Dan
in a fight.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,966
You're mixing
a Hardy, bud.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,333
Am not.
Are, too.

11
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:30,700
You're down there
mixing a Tom Hardy.

12
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:32,166
Oh, I would smash
that dude

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,733
like a Terry's
Chocolate Orange

14
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:35,333
Same. How's your beers?

15
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:36,433
ALL: I'll have a beer.

16
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:37,833
Must be nice,
you can pick up
some extra shifts here

17
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:40,933
while Gail's down
at her South American
Single's Resort, huh, Bonnie?

18
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:42,666
You wanna know what?
If two of my bars burnt down

19
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,933
I'd be fucking off, too.

20
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:45,200
I'm envious
of that old goat.

21
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:46,266
It's light lifting.

22
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,333
This place could run
off honor system
if it had to.

23
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:49,833
DARYL: Okay,
Katy and Bonnie,

24
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:52,000
who do you think
would win a fight,
me or Dan?

25
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:53,333
Dan.
(SIGHS)

26
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:54,700
Why don't you two
just arm wrestle

27
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:56,066
and get
to the bottom of it.
No.

28
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,500
Why not?

29
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:00,033
Well, because arm wrestling
is not a legitimate barometer
for strength,

30
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:01,133
and certainly
not toughness.

31
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,166
You're either born
a good arm wrestler
or you're not.

32
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,733
Youse could leg wrestle.

33
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,033
WAYNE: No.
Why not?

34
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,100
Well, because if they're
on the floor rubbing
their legs together,

35
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:09,333
they've both lost.

36
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:11,133
How are we gonna
sort this out?
Oh, youse could have to fight.

37
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,666
No.
Sure.

38
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,066
See, you're
a good friend, Dan.

39
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,333
How is Dan
a good friend
in all of this?

40
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,133
Well, Dan sees you're
quite upset about this.

41
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,500
He's willing to put
his beer down,

42
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:20,066
come over there
and beat the shit out of you
so that you're over it.

43
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:25,700
Tyson, who would win
in a fight between
Dan and Dary?

44
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:27,700
Dary.
(CHUCKLES) Yes.

45
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:30,000
KATY: Why?
Longer reach,
quicker on his feet.

46
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:31,833
Not above a nut shot
or a hair pull.

47
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:33,633
Joint Boy?
Squirrelly Dan.

48
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,300
KATY: Why?
'Cause he's Squirrelly.

49
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:39,833
Who do youse think
would win in a fight
between you two?

50
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,300
(BOTH SCOFF)
BOTH: Me.

51
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,700
BOTH: You?

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,233
BOTH: Me.

53
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:51,233
(THUDDING)

54
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:55,333
See, now there's a good friend.

55
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,366
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

56
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:08,133
Fifteen‐four
and I'd hoped for more.

57
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,100
Fifteen‐two,
that's where it's new.

58

♪ Nineteen go fuck yourself ♪

Fuck, she's really cooled
down out there.

65
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:28,033
Are you boys
down to pay
10 Neil deGrasse Tysons?

66
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,366
Where has Katy
been all day?

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,233

about the Letterkenny
Adult Spelling Bee,

and how much
it means to Katy?

You call yourself a friend.
Now wait.

93
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:27,733
You're right, Dan.

94
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,700
I'm sorry, Dary.

95
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:34,866
It's okay, good buddy.

96
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,366
It's just that I, uh...

97
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,000
...wish I could take
some of her pain
from last year,

98
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:43,266
put it on myself,
you know.

99
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,733
We alls dos,
good buddies.

100
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,766
I mean, she really
had it all.

101
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,266
Champion Letterkenny
Adult Spelling Bee
nine years running.

102
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,100
She was just a girl
when she won
her first Bee.

103
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,300
God damn it, she was
just a girl.
Then came Stewart.

104
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,633
We do not says that names
in this house, Dary.

105
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,766
That fuck oughta
spell with someone
his own size.

106
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,966
He's been spelling
out of his own weight class
for years now.

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,900
Like, she forgot
a silent E.

108
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:06,066
Completely out
of character for her.

109
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,366
Do you wanna know what?
That silent E may follow

110
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,033
her around
for the rest of her life.

111
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:11,066
She's worns it
like a shit stain
ever since.

112
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,266
That fuck thinks
that he can just

113
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,400
walk around town
spelling like that?

114
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:14,966
We all know
that types of spelling's

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
gonna catch up
to him one days.

116
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:20,133
It has to.
Okay, you wanna spell, bud?

117
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,966
Wanna walk around town
spelling like that, okay?

118
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,233
I'll spell with you
any day of the week

119
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,133
and I suggest you let
that one marinate.

120
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,033
KATY: Who's doing all
the hollering down there?

121
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:31,266
She's tryings
to studies, Waynes.

122
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:38,066
Like, it's clear
what needs to be done here.

123
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,333
Wanna make a pact?
Of course, we makes
a pacts, Dary.

124
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,633
I'm surprised we're not
making a pact right now.

125
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,066
We works around the clocks
to helps her get her spellings

126
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,200
ups to hers potential.

127
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:47,300
We don't sleep.

128
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,966
Keep her focused.
Keep her inspired.

129
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:50,866
Keep her hydrated.

130
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,633
We're coming in.

131
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,733
So cover up.

132
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,000
REILLY: Okay, girls.

133
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,633
Girls?
That's what I said.

134
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,000
Who you calling girls?

135
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:07,800
(STAMMERS) Oh. No,
we mean women.

136
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,400
Yes, that is my bad.

137
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:11,400
I am sorry.
It is an old habit.

138
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:14,000
See, we call the men
on our team "Boys."
So I just...

139
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:15,300
It's completely inappropriate.

140
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,666
Okay.
Mary‐Anne over there
is not a girl.

141
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,833
When's the last time
you saw a girl's tits
sag so low,

142
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:21,266
she could tuck 'em
into her joggers?

143
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,766
You're right,
Betty‐Anne.

144
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,133
To call us girls is
wildly inappropriate.

145
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,200
Look at you.

146
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,400
When's the last time
you saw a girl

147
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:29,733
with enough pubic hair
to lose her keys in?

148
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:31,900
Along with the buoyant
Canadian Tire key chain?

149
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:34,300
Okay, okay, okay.
That's enough, uh...

150
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:37,166
Ladies.
Yes, ladies.

151
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,933
I'm even
more offended
by that.

152
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:40,333
Tell me how
Mary‐Anne's a lady?

153
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:42,066
Her Jill‐strap's got
more skid marks

154
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,300
than a runaway truck
laying on a coastal

471
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,866
There was no intermission
slotted for today's bee.

gots to gets spelled

474
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,900
before someone
just keels over.

475
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,633
Someone's gotta start asking
the tough questions
around here.

476
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,700
I've seen this before, Jim.
It's time we learned from it.

477
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,966
In the words of arguably
the greatest Canadian
rock band of all time,

478
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,300
The Tragically Hip,
"It's a good life
if you don't weaken."

479
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,000
Also in the words
of Gordon Downie,

480
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,733
legendary lead singer
of The Tragically Hip,

481
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:47,400
"I can make you scared
if you want me to."

482
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:50,233
(STAMMERS) Hey, okay.

483
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:52,633
That's good then.
Fifteen minute
intermission, everyone.

484
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,266
Sorry about that, Wayne.

486
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,300
Youse get Reilly and Jonesy
on Jim Dickins' radar.

487
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,900
Some buttfuckery
at play there.

488
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,500
Jims.

489
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,800
Now I know
you noticed

490
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:10,933
that Reilly
and Jonesy's words

491
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:12,500
are simpler
than everyone else's,

492
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:15,666
and quite suspiciously
all hockeys‐related.

493
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,433
Yep, there's a wee bit
of buttfuckery at play
here, Jim.

494
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:20,500
This has been the system
ever since Uncle Eddie won

495
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:23,266
the very first
Letterkenny Adult Spelling Bee.
in the late '60s.

496
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,800
We must honor it.
Exactly.

497
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,533
And aren't you guys
the ones that are
always saying

498
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:28,433
you shouldn't fuck
with tradition.

499
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:30,800
It's fucking embarrassing.

500
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,833
Jim, McMurray's screwing
the system, here.

501
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:37,400
You can't understand
what he's saying.

502
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:39,466
He's pulling the wool
over your eyes, cowboy.

503
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,933
Well, well, well.

506
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:47,733
What's the matter, Tanis?

507
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,866
You got some money
riding on the bee?

508
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,266
Money?

509
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,333
There is to be no betting
at the Letterkenny
Adult Spelling Bee.

510
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:56,933
Your dirty money is an insult
to the integrity of the sport.

511
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:58,566
Yeah, Tanis.

512
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,733
All this time talking
could be spent spelling.

513
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:03,400
It's not called
a Spelling Talk,

514

there will be a new order
