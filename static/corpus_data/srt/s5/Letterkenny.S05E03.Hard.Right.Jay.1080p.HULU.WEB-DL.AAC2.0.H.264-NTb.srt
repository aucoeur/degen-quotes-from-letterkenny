00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,100
We were discussing headlines
from the city newspaper
the other day...

2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,633
DAN: Damn shame
about MoDeans
burning down.

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:19,633
Do you know what?
It's really something

4
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,866
how we keep losing
those locations
to drink at.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,900
The Ukrainian Center
is a healthy
consolation, though.

6
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:27,800
Well, everybody knows
the cheapest beers are
at the Ukrainian Center.

7
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,700
With the Legion being
a close second.

8
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:32,033
When's Gail getting back
from her South American
singles resort?

9
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,866
When she's
had her fill, I suppose.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,933
Delicious pun.

11
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,133
Thank you, Wayne.

12
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,900
ALL: Thank you, Bonnie.

(DAN GRUMBLING)

14
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,100
Now, was that
your tummy grumbling?
Or was that you proper?

15
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,533
DAN: That'd
be me proper.

16
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:46,866
A little grumble
in the jungle over there.

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,000
Little grumble
in the Bronx.

18
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:49,100
A little
royal grumble.

19
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:52,533
DAN: It was
a grumble proper.

20
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:55,800
Now, I'm a devout pupil
of Social Justice Warriors,
Professor Tricia.

21
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,133
The devoutest.

22
00:00:57,166 --> 00:01:00,166
But dare I say things
in the city is getting
wee bit out of hands.

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,600
What's the frequency,
Kenneth?

24
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:04,833
Well, the story I just read
here is quite the incredible
chain of events.

25
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:06,233
You know, there's
so many causes now.

26
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,133
They're just tripping
right over each other.

27
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,866
Well, it's better than
driving into each other.

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,033
That was
a bit dark, Dary.

29
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:12,166
What's the scoop, Dan?

30
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,466
Here's the scoop.

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,866
Bunch of gals said that
they were gonna stop
tweetings for a day

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,300
out of protest
for sexual abuses
towards womens.

33
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,233
And they encouraged mens
to stops tweetings
in supports of the womens.

34
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:23,533
So, what's
the problem?
Oh, I wasn't finished.

35
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:24,433
Well, what
happened next?

36
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:26,033
DAN: I'll tells you
what happens next.

37
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:27,666
Some black gals joined in
on the protest,

38
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,166
but they got mad
at the white girls
protesting,

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,666
because womens of colors
didn't receive the same
supports on similar issues.

40
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,233
I think I see where
you're going with this.

41
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:35,866
Well, did something
happen even after that?

42
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,233
DAN: Something
did happen after that.

43
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:40,000
One of the white gals
asking for supports
got supports from one guy,

44
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,400
but she told him
he could fuck right off

45
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:44,233
because apparently he used
to call gals "broads"
back in high schools.

46
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:46,933
But they are tweeting
about not tweeting.
Do I have that right?

47
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:48,966
I got a feeling something
even happened after that.

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,266
Yeah, me too, Dary.
Me too. I got that
same feeling.

49
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,633
Well, here's what happened
even after that.

50
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,966
The President of Iceland
sends out

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,266
a happy birthday tweet
to his daughter, Alfheiour.

52
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,200
And now all the gals
saying that you
shouldn't be tweetings

53
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:01,200
turns hims into
public enemy number one.

54
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,966
And it's on Twitter
they're doing that?

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,600
And to the President
of Iceland,
they're doing that?

56
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:08,166
Icelanders are the most
lovable fucking people
on planet Earth.

57
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,866
One more thing
even happens,
so help me God.

58
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,600
So help me God.
Something else
did happen after that,

59
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,100
because it turns out
the President of Iceland's
daughter, Alfheiour,

60
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:18,233
has got herself a case
of the Down syndromes.

61
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:20,166
So here comes the Special
Olympics advocates,

62
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,733
and they're
in a real bad way.

63
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,100
As they should be.

64
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,766
If you wanna go at Iceland,
you better have your fucking
facts right.

65
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,733
Well, here's the kicker,
turns out the President of
Iceland's daughter, Alfheiour,

66
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:31,966
is also a refugee
from war‐torn Somalia
what he's adopted.

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,600
So that increases
the tension between

68
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:34,800
the womens of colors
not tweeting

69
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,533
and the white gals
not tweeting.

70
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:38,166
To top it all off,
here comes World Vision,

71
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,733
and they're
coming in a'swinging.

72
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:43,133
Fuck every duck.
What next?

73
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,300
Oh, here's what
happened after that.

74
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,000
Remember that first guy
that they told
to fucks right off

75
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,600
'cause he used to
call gals "broads"
back in high school?

76
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:51,866
Turns out he's paralyzed
from the waist down.

77
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,966
So here comes the war amps
saying, "You better back
the fuck off our guy."

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,033
Enough's enough.

79
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:57,233
I can't handle anymore.

80
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:59,866
Well, there's no way
there's more.
There's no goddamn way.

81
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,000
Wait. There is more.

82
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:03,633
Turns out the President
of Icelands

83
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,533
is paralyzed from
the necks down,

84
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,733
so now everybody's back
on Iceland's sides again.

85
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:09,833
Oh, right where
they should've been
the whole fucking time.

86
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:12,800
Now, it's from the neck down
that he's paralyzed, you say?

87
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,300
So, how does he
even make a tweet?

88
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,866
And they're all
doing this on Twitter?

89
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,733
Where else but Twitter
would this be happenings?

90
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:19,533
On the day they're not
exposed to be tweeting?

91
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,533
On the very same day
they're not exposed
to be tweeting.

Well, the Letterkenny Chiefs
is changing their names
and logos.

99
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,300
That sounds
about right.
Probably for the best.

100
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,400
They had a good run.

"The only constant

It's a wee bit to wrap
your head around there.

around here is everything

going in a hand basket.

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,033
As opposed to
what kind of basket?

112
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,133
Well, there's a bazillion
different kinds of baskets.

What else?

114

Okay, so maybe
there's not a bazillion
different kinds, but...

115
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,700
Yeah, it's
definitely not a bazillion
different kinds...

116
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:26,766
Yeah, that's what
I just said,

"There's not a bazillion
different kinds of baskets."

118

saying "bazillion" unless
you mean a bazillion...

emphasis. I was saying,

120

"Bazillion different
kinds of baskets."

one, Dary?

good idea.

already too many Rough Riders
in the area as it is?

145

You got
the Redford Rough Riders.
And a one.

146

You got
the Welno Rough Riders.
And a two.

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,900
Yeah, but if we're all
going to be Rough Riders,
why even have teams?

152
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:37,766
Why not just be
a big bunch of
Rough Riders?

153
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,700
Why don't you just
name the whole league
the Rough Riders?

154
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,066
Why even stop there?

155
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,566
Why don't we just go ahead
and name the whole
human race Rough Riders?

156
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,733
Like, you see
what I'm saying.

157
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:45,833
Yeah. Today,
we're all Rough Riders.

158
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:47,366
What exactly
is a Rough Rider?

159
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,133
I don't know. All's I'm saying
is that there's too many
of them. Don't you see?

160
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,866
KATY: So, what else
is in the running?

161
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,700
DAN: Ah, second place
is the Letterkenny
Muff Riders.

162
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,166
Yeah, I can get
behind Muff Riders.

163
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,233
Hmm. What else?

164
00:06:57,266 --> 00:07:00,133
Third place goes to
the Letterkenny
Foot Fuckers.

165
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,533
Shouldn't that be
in first place,

166
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:03,800
on account that it
has foot in the title,
and it's a soccer team?

167
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,200
What else?

168
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:09,300
Well, fourth place is a tie
between the Big Nickelbacks
and the 69ers.

169
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,566
(CHUCKLING)

170
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,633
Both good choices.

171
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,533
KATY: I don't know
who to root for.

172
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,733
DAN: People likes
to root for a 69er.

173
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:16,033
(GRUMBLING)

174
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:19,233
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

175
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:21,233
I don't have a problem.

176
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:23,533
I don't have...
I don't have a problem.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

177
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,266
I don't have a problem.

178
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:28,566
(SHOUTING)
Where is it?
It's right here.

179
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
First, the meth.

180
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:35,133
(WHINING)

181
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,066
(SHOUTING) I think
you do have a problem.

182
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,033
I don't have a problem!

183
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:40,233
You've never acted
like this before the...

184
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:42,233
This is all because of the...
(INAUDIBLE)

185
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:45,166
I've never seen it
get its claws in so deep.

186
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,733
(GRUNTS)

187
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:47,900
Give me the dark web.

188
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:49,700
Stewart!
I need the dark web.

189
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:50,966
You're killing him!

190
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,066
(MOANING)
It is killing you!

191
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,833
Give me the dark web.

192
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:56,300
Take the dark web.

193
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,866
The dark web is yours.
(COUGHS)

194
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,100
(GASPS)

195
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,133
Okay, so you keep
the meth over there, right?

196
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,566
We do. Let me show you.

197
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,866
I'm in.

198
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,833
Letterkenny, the hard right
is inside of you.

199
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:16,900
Fuck!

200
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:18,866
These stooges again.

201
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,266
I don't see a video request
from them.

202
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,633
How am I hearing their voice?

203
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,300
Must be some high‐tech
dark web shit.

204
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,866
Stu? Stu!

205
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,600
Appreciate the
Stooges reference.

206
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,800
Everyone knows Curly was
the original skinhead.

207
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:36,000
Plus Ron Asheton from
Iggy and the Stooges had a real
Third Reich obsession.

208
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:40,233
Good Christ! It smells like
somebody's been smoking
gate waves in here.

209
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:41,866
The Chiefs are changing
their name.

210
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,933
Who?

211
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:45,000
Your beloved junior soccer team.

212
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:47,066
BOTH: Who?

213
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,133
Ah! Nobody cares about
anything anymore.

214
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,800
What about the history?
The tradition?

215
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,833
What's a junior soccer team?

216
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,666
Some people
still care, all right?
You best believe.

217
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,266
And we are recruiting.

218
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,033
So, gentlemen, are you ready
to join the hard right?

219
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:05,233
Politics?
(SCOFFS)

220
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:07,300
We're anarchists.

221
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,166
(SCOFFS) Yeah. Who cares if the
soccer team changes its name?

222
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
The hard right, that's who.

223
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:14,033
Chiefs is a strong name.

224
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:18,966
I remember a time when
being called a chief
was a good thing.

225
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,866
People like to root for a chief.

226
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,233
(EXCLAIMS)
This used to be the heartland.

227
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:27,600
Now, it is just the
other heartland

228
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,233
of far‐left liberal cucks.

229
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:32,833
Did somebody get their
feelings hurt?

230
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:35,600
Did somebody sign a petition?

231
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:39,066
Uh, news flash,
you're all caving to PC culture.

232
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,300
You're just a bunch of
far‐left liberal fucking
pinko snowflakes.

233
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,233
Oh, we've been called worse.

234
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:48,033
But might as well just change
the name to Letterkenny Cucks.

235
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:51,000
Regional champs
of Cuckistan!
Okay.

236
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:54,633
This is what the failed
patriarchy looks like.

237
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:58,233
I'm so sick of you
beta male SJWs.

238
00:09:58,266 --> 00:09:59,700
We're not SJWs.

239
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,066
I actually identify
as a wood nymph.

240
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,533
Super weird.
Be gone.

241
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:06,266
Oh, we'll be gone.

242
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,233
Just as soon as you betas
show us where the alphas are.

243
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:13,100
I'll see myself out.
I assume all of you
are following suit.

244
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:14,133
(SHOUTS)

245
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,666
He talks more than I do.

246
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,033
That was weird.

247
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:31,033
Ah, yes! Now we're talking.
The alphas. Real men.

248
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:32,766
No matriarchy in sight.

249
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,133
Who the fuck are you?

250
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,833
I'm Hard Right Jay,
and I represent the Hard Right,

251
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:40,266
a group with
far‐right ideologies

252
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,733
that rejects mainstream
conservatism and endeavors to
promote white nationalism.

253
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:46,200
Oh, white nationalism?

254
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,600
Good thing Gail,
the owner of the old bars
ain't here.

255
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:53,633
Oh, small town bar owner,
what is she, like a good
sixth‐generation Scottish woman?

256
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,633
No.

257
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,466
What are you's getting on
about over there?

258
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,166
Did you dinks
bring these dudes here?

259
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,133
What's the first
meal of the day,
Daryl?

260
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,700
Your mom.
Attaboy.

261
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:01,833
Breakfast!

262
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:05,533
Ah, that's it, right.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:07,866
Run away like true socialistas.

264
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,966
At least your actions
are consistent with
your failed ideologies.

265
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,800
You edgelords
are a walking horde
of participation trophies.

266
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,666
Go back to giving out
hand jobs for free.

267
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,766
We're not socialistas.
I'm still with her.

268
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,200
We're anarchists.
And our hand jobs aren't free.

269
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,866
So...

270
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,566
Forg...

271
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,233
Forgive...

272
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:38,300
Forgive them. They don't
see the big picture. Yet.

273
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,433
What's the big picture?

274
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,600
You wanna see how deep
this rabbit hole really goes?

275
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,666
Or are you guys globalists?

276
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,900
What's that?
Ah!

277
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:49,266
I'll admit, I was anticipating

278
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,766
the low energy, country cuck
road show, but you're curious.

279
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Color me glad.

280
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:56,866
It's time to wake up.

281
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,233
It's time for you to spit out
all of the toxic sludge

282
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:02,266
you've been spoon fed
by the Ian Hanomansings

283
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,033
and the Gloria Macarenkos
of the world.

284
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:06,866
We are a movement.

285
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,766
Bowel movement
by the looks of it.

286
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,033
Ah, hachi‐machi,
I like your fire.

287
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:14,266
We could use more women
in the movement.

288
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,300
We have next to none,
for reasons we can't
quite decode.

289
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,800
Pitter patter.
Yes, pitter patter.

290
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,133
All lives matter.

291
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,133
News flash,
the out of control PC police

292
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,066
are forcing your beloved
Letterkenny Chiefs
to change their name.

293
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,133
Yeah, we caught that.

294
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,966
Yeah, well, we're here
to protest that.

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,766
Our legions of brothers
will be joining me

296
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,900
at John Letterkenny Field
later.

297
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:40,933
And we want you,
the salt of the earth alphas,

298
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:47,800
the stewards of traditional
morals, traditional values,
the silent majority, to join us.

299
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,700
The fight against poor,
uneducated libtards

300
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,966
requires nothing short
of a massacre.

301
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,666
Now you're a bit
fucking dramatic, eh?

302
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,266
Why is keeping the name
of the Chiefs important to you?

303
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,600
ALL: It isn't.
Oh, oh, it's not. It isn't?

304
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:04,033
Well, not really,
in the long run.
Nor the short run, really.

305
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:06,166
Yeah, no need to get your
jimmies all out of joint.

306
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,900
Well, but you... You understand
why it's important
to fight the left? Yes?

307
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:13,100
I didn't know it was necessary,
much less important.

308
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:16,766
The point is
the government
is trying to keep you

309
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,733
and your humble agricultural
livelihoods thoroughly cucked.

310
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,066
It's time to wake up
and smell the chem trails.

311
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,533
It's time to stand up
for your God given right

312
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:29,200
to have kick‐ass names
for all your favorite teams,

313
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:32,200
and fuck anybody whose feelings
get hurt along the way.

314
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:33,666
Oh, is that what time it is?

315
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,533
Oh, you think I don't have
feelings? You think my feelings
don't get hurt?

316
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,833
My grandfather has
a pacemaker, right?

317
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:42,600
Every time I watch
the Indiana Pacers
play basketball,

318
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:44,133
it makes me think of Papi.

319
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:48,066
And his irregular heartbeat.
And it fucks me up, big time.

320
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,100
You see me complaining
to the Indiana Pacers
or anyone in the NBA?

321
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,933
Mmm, suck it up, buttercup.

322
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,066
So?
So what?

323
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
So join us.

324
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,733
Tell you what.
I'll fight you for it.
You and me.

325
00:14:03,766 --> 00:14:05,533
Sorry, what?
What I'm saying is,

326
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,933
I'll fight you.

327
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:10,100
And if you win I'll come
to the field with you.

328

But if you lose,
we're not asking for
anything in return.

329

Ah, you SJWs are a lost cause.

330

are on the other rink.

340

Uh, we just, uh,
thought you strapping alphas

341
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,933
might want to know
that the globalists

342
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:54,333
are trying to turn your
small town into a hive

343
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:56,266
of post‐castrati extremism.

344
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,933
What the fuck's castrati?

345
00:14:57,966 --> 00:14:59,366
Uh, it's a pasta, bro.

346
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,066
Uh, it's pronounced
"pah‐sta," bro.
Is it?

347
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,366
Today, it's the Letterkenny
Chiefs. Tomorrow, it'll be
your beloved Shamrocks.

348
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,233
Well, you know, the Chiefs
is kinda not PC though, buddy.

kind of in touch there.

350

What if they decide to get
butt hurt over the Letterkenny
Shamrocks name next

351
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,033
and force you to change it

352
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:22,400
just because they don't know
how to control their... Their
fragile beta male emotions?

What then, huh?

354
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,266
You don't see a bunch
of Irish people protesting
here, do you?

355
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,666
No, you don't.

356
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,100
They're not,
(IMITATING IRISH ACCENT) "Argh,
please change your name!"

357
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,466
None of that's happening.
You wanna know why?

358
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,666
Because Irish people don't
fucking complain about
anything, all right?

359
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,400
Irish people know how to
take it like a champ, okay?

360
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:43,133
You take their potatoes away,
they don't say a fucking thing.

361
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,133
It's pronounced
"po‐tah‐to."
Is it?

362
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,266
It's called "manning up,"
gentlemen. You might want
to look into it.

363
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,066
What do you think, buddy?

364
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,166
I think this guy's
a goof, buddy.

365
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,433
Cool, buddy.
Yeah, but...

366
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:59,533
On that note, I'm not really
a fan of the Shamrocks name.

‐Really?
‐Yeah.

368
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,666
Me too, buddy. I mean,
if we're talking about
some kind of negative

369
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,633
stereotype attached
to that name, you know?

370
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,000
Right? It's like,
just because
my name is Reilly,

371
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:11,200
that doesn't necessarily mean
that I'm a drunken leprechaun.

372
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:12,533
Maybe we should change
the name, buddy.

375
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:18,066
If anybody should
change their names,
it should be us.

Shamrockette anyway?
A leaf with tits?

Oh, this isn't your
matriarch, is it?

378
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:28,300
You can't just add "ette" to
the end of the men's team
and expect women to like it.

379
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,633
We should change our names
to something fierce and feminine
and powerful.

had to start kindergarten
two years late

grasp coloring.

to get a vasectomy

about another you coming into
the world while I fucked him.

We were just starting
to get them under control.

389

You're screwing it up, bro.
You're getting them all
fired up again.

390
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,266
Bringing family into it now,
Mary‐Anne? I would never
stoop so low,

391
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,500
especially with the
recent passing of your mother,

392
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:06,700
who told me before she died
that my dad is your dad too.

No, but Nazi, really? Nazi?

Would a Nazi ride
a Yamaha scooter?

A pansy Nazi? Sure.

include ramen, pad thai, or pho?

on the Letterkenny Banner.

454
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,000
What's the latest?

455
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,700
(DAN GRUMBLING)

456
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:28,000
Was that your tummy grumbling
or was that you proper?

457
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:29,600
That was my tummy.
Good enough.

458
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:32,166
Well, it looks like they
canceled the online polls
to pick the new team name.

459
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,433
Oh, is that what they did?

460
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:35,533
Yeah, it seems like the
Muff Riders was
runnings away with it.

461
00:21:35,566 --> 00:21:38,966
Foot Fuckers made
more sense by far.
I'm disappointed.

462
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,233
What are they
going with instead?

463
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,000
Rough Riders.
Of course they are.

464
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:43,166
Playoffs start next week.

465
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,000
Who they playing?
Runforough Rough Riders.

466
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:46,033
That's gonna be
a really good game.

467
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:47,966
DARYL: Must be hard kicking
the ball in the snow.

468
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,266
My money's on the Rough Riders.

469
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,400
You're crazy. I got the
Rough Riders by a mile.

470
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:52,333
Care to make it interesting?

471
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:54,200
DAN: I'll put ten bucks
on the Rough Riders.

472
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,700
Make it twenty.
I'll take that.

473
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:56,900
I'm in too.

474
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:59,300
DAN: See, Wayne, people love
to cheer for a rough rider.

475
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,633
The world's going to hell
in a hand basket, big brother.

476
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:03,966
In a what, Dary?

477
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,433
Brefekst bakset.
Attaboy.

478
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:15,066
