That's your body's way of
removing them from you.

You're getting rid of that

and then you just takes it
right back in orally.

Well, youse can
both take it anally,

It's impolite
to kiss and tell, Dan.

‐No.
‐No.

57
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:05,209
Well, Professor Tricia from
my women's studies group,

58
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:07,709
she says
it's quite commons to...

59
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:12,175
Enter through
the back door. Uh...

60
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,475
Mind you she didn't stress
whethers that was naturals...

61
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,909
Well, but, like I've been
told, that where vagina sex

62
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:20,209
is like a total encasing
of the penis, like...

63
00:02:20,242 --> 00:02:22,875
Like sticking a hot dog
inside a pogo,

64
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,309
and then like, anal sex is a
partial encasing of the penis,

65
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:27,242
so it'd be more like

66
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:28,609
putting a hot dog
in a beer bottle.

67
00:02:28,642 --> 00:02:30,275
‐Waynes?
‐No.

68
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:32,275
‐Dary?
‐The answer's still no.

69
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:34,675
But I have been told
the same thing as Dary,

70
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,775
that whereas vagina sex
provides stimulation

71
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:38,442
of the entire penis,

72
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:40,775
like a sausage
inside a burrito,

73
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:44,475
but bum sex provides
stimulation only from like...

74
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:46,775
Well, like the rim
of the butt hole

75
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:48,875
rather than inside
the butt hole also.

76
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:50,675
So, what you're sayings is,

77
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,909
it's less like going inside
this Long John Silvers here,

78
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:58,509
and more like going inside
this honey cruller here.

79
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:01,709
Correct. It's less like going
inside this loaf of bread...

80
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:05,509
And more like going
inside this bagel.

81
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:07,709
‐Waynes?
‐No.

82
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:09,475
‐Dary?
‐Answer's still no.

83
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:11,542
But I have been told that
it's less like going inside

84
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:13,442
this wheel of Brie cheese

85
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:15,909
and more like going inside
this piece of Swiss cheese.

86
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:18,642
Oh, I love Swiss cheese.

87

why is Katy's taking you backs

Probably 'cause

00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:53,909
‐And what shall I call you?
‐Gae.

161
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:55,642
I'm the only gay in this crew!

162
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:57,242
And I was born this way,
Stewart!

163
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:58,675
I support you, remember?

164
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:01,242
Let me get this straight.
He's a homosexual?

165
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,142
That's exactly what my mother
said to me.

166
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:05,309
(CRYING) The exact same way.

167
00:06:05,342 --> 00:06:07,809
You will delete yourself
from this dwelling, girl.

168
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:09,642
But not before
you reveal your motive

169
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:11,742
behind your vexations streak!

170
00:06:11,775 --> 00:06:14,309
‐Fine.
‐And after that, huh,

171
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:16,409
you better bizzounce!

172
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:19,742
My name is Gae.

173
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:23,809
That's your name?

174
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:26,842
Wow.

175
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,509
And I thought Roald's parents
never gave him a chance...

176
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:30,309
(SOBBING) They didn't...

177
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:36,475
My parents banished me to
Letterkenny from the city

178
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:39,642
to live with my aunt
because of poor behavior.

179
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:42,142
‐You're an outcast.
‐I'm a deportee.

180
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,909
‐You're a vagrant.
‐(WHISPERS) I'm in exile.

181
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:46,842
(EXHALES) Arresting.

182
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,175
Everyone here
is some form of derelict.

183
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:53,642
I will hear you out...

184
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,375
Gae.

185
00:06:56,409 --> 00:07:01,242
ROALD: Dad...
Yup. Still a homo...

186
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:02,875
But you're the one who
named me after the author of

187
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:05,442
Charlie and
the Chocolate Factory!

188
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,687
‐Listen up, you pilons.
‐Grab a knee, plugs.

189
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,120
All right. Now, I know

190
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:20,887
you guys may
not want to hear this,

191
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,320
but getting rid
of that puck bunny

192
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:25,087
is the first step towards
getting a W, boys.

193
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,687
We'll introduce you
to a couple of

194
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,687
sporty little spices
down the road, boys.

195
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,554
But I like that
sporty little spice.

196
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:32,787
BOTH: Pardon?

197
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,287
Sorry. Sorry, man, my bad.

198
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,620
Boomtown!

199
00:07:37,654 --> 00:07:39,654
But I like that
sporty little spice!

200
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:40,920
Okay.

201
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:42,120
Well, you'd better
learn to hate her

202
00:07:42,154 --> 00:07:43,254
because she's
the reason we have

203
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:45,187
zero W's on the season, boys.

204
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,287
‐We need that W, boys.
‐Gotta have that W, boys.

205
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,054
Gotta want that W, boys.

206
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:51,987
And the first step
to getting it is...

207
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,020
Beating your
opponent mentally.

208
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:55,320
Gotta get inside
of his head, boys.

209
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:58,154
Hockey is 90% mental,
10% skill.

210
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,987
Unless you're a retired NHL
tough guy Basil McRae,

211
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,154
who says hockey is 50% mental,
50% being mental.

212
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,720
(SOFTLY) Still not sure
that's PC, buddy.

213
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,120
No. Baz makes his
own rules, though, buddy.

214
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:13,620
‐Love Baz, bro.
‐Baz for life, yo.

215
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:15,654
(BOTH CLEAR THROAT)

216
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:16,987
Now, the easiest way

217
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,654
to get inside your
opponent's head, boys,

218
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,220
is by chirping from the bench.

219
00:08:20,254 --> 00:08:21,754
Obviously, boys.

220
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:23,720
Talk is for Schmelts,
you little bitch.

221
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,820
Do your talking on
the scoreboard, schmelts.

222
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:27,254
‐Oh. Oh, okay.
‐Hmm...

223
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:29,187
Have any of you guys
been doing any talking

224
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,887
on the scoreboards lately?

225
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,720
‐Hey? Hmm?
‐Nice stats, no stats.

226
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,620
Fine, you little bitch.

227
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:37,920
We'll try it
your way, schmelts.

228
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:39,187
BOTH: Good.

229
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,654
Tonight, we will
be taking you boys

230
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,187
through chirping
from the bench 101.

231
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,020
‐We can get this W, boys.
‐We will get this W, boys.

232
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:55,720
You're not gonna get this
W, boys, not by yourselves.

233
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:58,320
But luckily for you pheasants,

234
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:01,320
someone in this room
has got some jam.

235
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,654
Ready to meet
your new teammate? Come on!

236
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:08,820
(WATER RUNNING)

237
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:10,354
Look at this tour de force.

238
00:09:10,387 --> 00:09:12,854
This piece de resistance.

239
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,687
This masterpiece.

240
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,054
‐Huh?
‐(GRUNTING SOFTLY)

241
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:18,920
Look at that hustle.
Look at that jam.

242
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:21,620
Multitasking, pheasants.

243
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:25,920
Maxing every single second!

244
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:28,054
That's how
you get the W, boys.

245
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:29,754
SHORESY: Well, fuck, boys,
I was already down here

246
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:31,854
ripping ass whilst
figured I'd rip some raps.

247
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:33,687
What the fuck are you
looking at, tit fucker?

248
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,654
‐Give your balls a tug.
‐Fuck you, Shoresy.

249
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:37,720
Fuck you, Reily. Fight me,
see what happens.

250
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:39,187
Yeah, what's gonna
happen, Shoresy?

251
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,254
Three things, I hit you,
you hit the pavement,

252
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:42,687
ambulance hits 60.

253
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,687
That's the worst chirp
I've ever heard

254
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,787
in my entire life, Shoresy.

255
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,954
That's my slow‐learning

256
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:47,787
Mennonite uncle's
favorite chirp.

257
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,987
SHORESY: Yeah, it's your mom's
favorite chirp, too, buddy.

258
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,254
Ask her, see what happens.

259
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:51,887
Yeah?
What's gonna happen, Shoresy?

260
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Three things, I hit you,
you hit the pavement,

261
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:55,120
I fuck your mom again.

262
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:56,887
Fuck you, Shoresy.

263
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,020
Fuck you, Jonesy. Your mom
just liked my Instagram post

264
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:01,087
from two years ago
in Puerto Vallarta.

265
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,787
Tell her I'll put
my swim trunks on for her

266
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,220
anytime she likes.

267
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:05,987
Fuck you, Shoresy!

268
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,687
Fuck you, Reilly.

269
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,887
Your mom keeps trying to slip
a finger in my bum,

270
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,654
but I keep telling her
I only let

271
00:10:10,687 --> 00:10:12,620
Jonsey's mom do that,
you fuckin' loser.

272
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,054
My mom would never put
a finger in your bum!

273
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:16,720
Mum's a fuckin' saint. Fuck!

274
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:18,720
Fuck your entire fuckin' life,
you piece of shit.

275
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,054
Gail, how're ya now?

276
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,720
‐Good, 'an you?
‐Not bad.

277
00:10:35,787 --> 00:10:37,754
ALL: To MoDean's 2!

278
00:10:40,387 --> 00:10:42,054
Ah.

279
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:43,354
It's a hell of a space
you got.

280
00:10:43,387 --> 00:10:44,654
Thanks for the help, boys.

281
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,354
You're welcome, Gails.

282
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:48,320
Wasn't Jivin' Pete supposed
to deliver those himself?

283
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:50,087
‐Yeah.
‐What happened with that?

284
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,154
My cousin said
she seen him with

285
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:52,787
some degens from up country.

286
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,587
(GROWLS)

287
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,654
Anywho, Old Gail's all sorts
of jazzed about MoDean's 2.

288
00:10:57,687 --> 00:10:59,020
So are we, Gails.

289
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:01,020
I'm so jazzed
I couldn't sleep last night.

290
00:11:01,054 --> 00:11:04,020
I was up flickin' more bean
than a Starbucks barista.

291
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:05,787
‐Good enough, Gail.
‐I mean it.

292
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,854
Handled more dime
than a homeless man.

293
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:10,154
‐Where do these go?
‐Back door...

294
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:12,920
Where you know
you're always welcome, Wayne.

295
00:11:12,954 --> 00:11:14,954
‐Okay.
‐(OBJECT THUDS)

296
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:17,287
There someone else here?

297
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,154
Yeah. I hired
a couple waitresses.

298
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,720
(MUSIC PLAYING)

299
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:28,120
Oh...

300
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,787
Bonnie McMurray.

301
00:11:38,354 --> 00:11:42,554
I thought you said there
was two, uh, waitresses.

302
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,187
‐Glen?
‐Wayne!

303
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,754
(CHUCKLES) Well,

304
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,354
I guess the kitten's out
of the clutch, again.

305
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:04,187
Glen's back to waitressing.

306
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,920
Well, you look...

307
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:09,754
‐Ordinary.
‐(EXCLAIMS)

308
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:11,220
Did you hear that?
That's some hot praise coming

309
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:13,120
from Mr. Extraordinary.
(CHUCKLES)

310
00:12:13,154 --> 00:12:14,654
Gave him a little makeover.

311
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:16,054
Figured if you guys
get some eye candy,

312
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:18,720
old Gail is gonna help
herself to a fistful too.

313
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:20,920
Mmm.
Gail got me the Lasik so...

314
00:12:20,954 --> 00:12:21,954
(GROWLS)

315
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:24,720
BOTH: Hi, Bonnie.

316
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:26,220
‐Hi, Wayne.
‐How're ya now?

317
00:12:26,254 --> 00:12:27,654
Bonnie, kegs are coming in,

318
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:29,187
so make sure
the lines are clean.

319
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,720
Glen, go throw some ice
in the urinals.

320
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:33,687
I know it's like a little
video game for you guys.

321
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,054
Can confirm.

322
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,320
BOTH: Bye, Bonnie.

323
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:37,787
BOTH: Bye, Wayne.

324
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,620
No, I was going
to say it first.

325
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:42,020
You don't want to go
toe‐to‐toe with me, darlin'.

326
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:43,320
Anyway, back to Jivin'.

327
00:12:43,354 --> 00:12:45,154
He's turned into
a bit of a tit, hasn't he?

328
00:12:45,187 --> 00:12:46,854
Yeah, his pals too.

329
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:48,354
Well, if you've got something
to say about Jivin',

330
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:49,787
you should
say it to his face.

331
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,687
Bad gas travels
fast in a small town.

332
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,187
You don't want him hearin'
that from somebody else.

333
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,687
‐It's dishonorable.
‐It's a true story.

334
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,920
Saddle up to the bar
when you're done.

335
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:01,787
I'll show my new Haitian taco.

336
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,620
Well, I don't know
if that's foods or not,

337
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:05,620
but if it is,
I'm lookin' forward to it.

338
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:06,787
It's only for Wayne.

339
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,020
Well, then I guess
it's not foods.

340
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,687
But I'm gonna pencil you
in for a chats, Gail,

341
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,954
'cause Haitian tacos,

342
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:13,087
that sounds like we got
something there.

343
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,587
You guys remember when Jivin
was pissing down the hay mow

344
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,820
and Alexander
was climbing up

345
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:20,920
and he got a bit of pee
in his mouth?

346
00:13:20,954 --> 00:13:22,720
Enough talk about Jivin'.

347
00:13:22,754 --> 00:13:24,754
And then,
you remember the same night

348
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:27,020
Alexander fell face first
into the cow paddy

349
00:13:27,054 --> 00:13:28,787
and got a bit
of poop up nose?

350
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,320
That's pretty much par for
the course with Alexanders.

351
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:33,154
So, what would
you rather have then,

352
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,687
a bit of pee in your mouth or
a bit of poop up your nose?

353
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,887
Well...

354
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,287
Well, fuckin' neither.

355
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,020
Well, but it's hypothetical,
it's a game.

356
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,854
It's called,
"Would You Rather."

357
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:44,320
So, you got to pick one or the
other is what you're saying.

358
00:13:44,354 --> 00:13:45,754
Yes. It's hypothetical.

359
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:47,320
Kinda feels
like you did pot.

360
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:49,154
Well, how much pee's
are we talking about?

361
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:50,587
Yeah, and how much poop?

362
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,054
Okay, so if we're
talking about,

363
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:54,220
like an eyedropper,
be like, mmm...

364
00:13:54,254 --> 00:13:57,587
Four or five drops of pee,
right in your mouth.

365
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,020
Or, let's call it like,

366
00:14:01,054 --> 00:14:02,854
the end
of the pinkie fingernail,

367
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:05,320
full poop, up your nose.

368
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:07,020
For the rest
of your life.

369
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,754
Oh, so it's for the rest
of your fuckin' life now?

370
00:14:08,787 --> 00:14:11,154
Yeah. Would you rather have

371
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:14,687
a bit of pee in your mouth,
or a bit of poop up nose?

372
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,654
And you... You can't spits
the pee's out your mouth

373
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:18,087
or blows the poops
out of your nose?

374
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,754
Well, see, Dary would just
lick it off his lips

375
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:21,154
after blowin' it out anyway.

376
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:23,754
That's correct, Dan.

377
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:25,287
I think I'd take
the poops in my nose.

378
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,087
But then you'd be smelling

379
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,120
poop for the rest of your
life. And poop is potent, pal.

380
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:30,654
Yeah, but if you had
pee's in your mouth

381
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:32,920
and every time you takes
a bites of food, you...

382
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:34,154
You're gonna be
tasting pee's.

383
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:35,854
Yeah.

384
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:37,054
And you're gonna have to
swallow a bit of that pee

385
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:38,354
with every time
you take a bite of food.

386
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:40,320
Do you wanna know what,
I'd take the poop.

387
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:41,854
Yes, I would take the poop.

388
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:45,054
Well, there's no chance
of ingesting's the poop?

389
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:47,254
Well, I'm not a scientist
or anything,

390
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,220
that's not really
my forte,

391
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:52,254
but say you had
the sniffles, right?

392
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:53,820
And you honk one back,

393
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:55,187
and you get a piece of that
poop right in

394
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,887
the back of your throat,
that's down the hatch.

395
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,987
Well, see that's changing
the fuckin' rules, Dary.

396
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,187
Before you said
you're either

397
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,820
taste the pee
or smell the poop.

398
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:02,987
Now you're saying you're
tasting and smelling poop.

399
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,887
Well, the pee is in your mouth
and the poop is in your nose.

400
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,820
What happens after that
is beyond my control.

401
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:10,087
Well, he's right there,
Wayne.

402
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,854

403
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:15,287

‐What the fuck was that shit?

‐That is... Shame on you.

dost thou knoweth
where Devon is?

Still a little
hurt and fragile

424
00:15:58,032 --> 00:16:00,332
from speaking with my father.
But thank you for asking.

What's with the clown costume?

Don't you watch the news?

439
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:36,332
There are clowns
inflicting apprehension

on the general public
via sheer terrorism,

441

or petty vandalism all over
North America.

even worse in Letterkenny,

so they have no choice
but to bring me back.

or a vagina for a mouth?

00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:11,932
Well, can you use them as

539
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:14,565
or are they just
sorts of there?

540
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:17,432
Mmm.
No, they are not functional,

541
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:18,732
so you can't have
an orgasm through 'em

542
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:20,099
and you can't take
a piss through 'em.

543
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:21,632
So then you're eatin'
from a vagina mouth

or sniffin' through
a penis nose?

00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,899
or three mosquitoes
every day of your life?

634
00:24:39,632 --> 00:24:41,799
No ostrich fuckers
here, hicks.

635
00:24:41,832 --> 00:24:44,065
I hear you're going around
town saying I'm full of shit.

636

637
00:24:45,532 --> 00:24:47,632
Bad gas travels fast
in a small town.

638
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:50,399
Yes, I did say that.

639
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,032
And that my friends
and I are so into ourselves

640
00:24:52,065 --> 00:24:53,865
we probably suck
each other off?

641
00:24:56,465 --> 00:24:59,065
Yes, I did say that too.

642
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,765
Would you say it to my face?

643
00:25:02,832 --> 00:25:04,532
I'm embarrassed
this got to you

644
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:05,865
before you heard it from me.

645
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:07,465
You should be.

646
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:09,699
I'm not the type of prick
to take the side door.

647
00:25:09,732 --> 00:25:11,499
I'll come right up
front and knock.

648
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:12,632
Good.

649
00:25:17,865 --> 00:25:19,665
‐Knock‐knock.
‐Who's...

650
00:25:20,865 --> 00:25:22,732
You're at Jivin' Pete's.

651
00:25:22,765 --> 00:25:24,865
I think you're full of shit
and you and your pals think

652
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:27,732
so much of yourselves you
probably suck each other off.

653
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:29,799
JIVIN' PETE:
Are you fuckin' serious?

654
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:31,765
What's anybody
gonna do about it?

655
00:25:48,732 --> 00:25:50,432
Say you're sorry.

656
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,865
JIVIN' PETE: I'm sorry.

657
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:55,499
Don't honk at girls,
and don't holler at girls.

658
00:25:55,532 --> 00:25:56,999
And don't talk to them when
they're not interested

659
00:25:57,032 --> 00:25:58,399
in talking to you.

660
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,665
And don't talk to 'em unless

661
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:01,332
they're interested
in talking to you.

662
00:26:02,132 --> 00:26:03,599
10‐4?

663
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:04,899
Over and out.
