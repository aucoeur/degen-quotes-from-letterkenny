00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,033
‐Oh, I'm havin' flash snacks.
‐To what?

8
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,500
To last time we went fishing.

9
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,100
On the ride home,
I had to sit in between

10
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:29,766
a family size
of Salt'n Vinnies

11

of Dill Picklers.

got a little out of whack,

14
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:36,900
We deserve the flak,
but now we're back on track.

15
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:38,200
We have a new plan of attack.

16
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:40,133
Everything we pack
has to fit in this sack.

17
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,833
We made a snack pact.

18
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:43,033
All these have to start
with the letter "C," in fact.

19
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:45,466
A, stop rhyming. B, why "C"?

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,100
‐Well, we trieds "A."
‐Apples.

21
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:48,866
‐And we trieds "B."
‐Bananas.

22
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,366
But "C" gave us
many choice options.

23
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,333
Cookies. Crackers.
Cheese. Chocolates.

24
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:54,433

and so forth.

at the end of the sentence,

345
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:43,033

be something like,
