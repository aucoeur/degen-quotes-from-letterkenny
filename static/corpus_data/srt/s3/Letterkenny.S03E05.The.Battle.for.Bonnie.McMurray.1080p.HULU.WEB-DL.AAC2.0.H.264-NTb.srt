in the way of W's, buddy.

And if you truly want
this team to come together...

238

And if you want this team
to get W's...

to see your junk, buddy.

Don't feel bad.

241

on every team.

00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,000
What are you
hiding down there, bud?

down there, bud?

Again, don't feel bad.

246
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:43,833
I mean, some teams have guys

247
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:45,366
that don't even shower
after praccy,

248
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,933

over there, hands?

I'm the guy
who keeps his hands dry

288
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:06,900
so he can still dig out
and light smokes.

that sort of thing.

293
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:14,500
What about you
keep one hand out of the water

294
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,333
to dig out smokes
and I'll keep one hand

295
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,966
out of the water
so I can light them.

296

I don't really have a type,
I don't think.

Okay, but if you

301
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:34,266
had to choose between
someone who was...

302
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,100
More big and hairy...

303
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:38,833
Versus somebody who's
a lot less big and hairy,

304
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:40,733
but more pale.

305
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:43,033
Which... Which way
are you leaning towards there?

306
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:44,866
Like, muscly big?

307
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,366
(STRAINING) Yeah. Muscly big.

308
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,966
Well, that's generous.

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,500
Oh, they're
in there somewhere.

310
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:52,433
And I like hairy versus, like,
groomed or manscaped.

311
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:54,166
But how hairy?

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,000
‐I could grow a beard.
‐No, you can't.

313
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,100
‐Can, too.
‐Cannot.

314
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:58,766
‐Can, too. Can, too!
‐Cannot.

315
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,900
Well, I can always
shaves my beard, easy‐peasy.

316
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,500
Or evens get a haircut.

317
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:04,866
Let's take about 80% off her
over there, Squirrelly Dan.

318
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,800
Yeah, sure.
Hey, look, bubbles!

319
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,466
Bonnie, what are you
looking for in a relationship?

320
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,400
I kinda like
being single right now.

321
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:13,133
‐Humor me.
‐I don't know.

322
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,933
I've never really
been in love.

323
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,166
Okay, let's get
this ball rolling.

324
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
(CLEARS THROAT) Wayne. Rosie.

325
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,266
What's the key
to making this look so good?

326
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,200
‐BOTH: Space.
‐Like, distance?

327
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:23,500
Not distance.

328
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,866
Although distance makes
the heart grow fonder.

329
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,733
‐Just space.
‐Space.

330
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:29,000
So you don't wanna get like...

331
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,066
BOTH: Sick of each other.

332
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,466
Example.

333
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
I like to read, a lot.
I like to stay in and read.

334
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,400
It's not easy telling a guy
you don't want to see him

335
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:40,066
because you want to stay in
and read.

336
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,233
Let's test this theory.
Dary...

337
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:47,000
Say you asked Bonnie McMurray
out on a date and she says...

338
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:49,200
I'm going to stay in and read.

339
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:50,733
‐She up to somethin'.
‐Dan?

340
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:52,133
Oh, she's
definitely up to something.

341
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,000
‐Wayne?
‐Must be a pretty good book.

342
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:55,766
Must be like...

343
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,733
‐The Road.
‐Uh, no.

344
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:02,033
Still suspicious of that.

345
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:04,366
Yeah, wouldn't that
make you... Wary?

346
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,466
No reason not to trust her
'til she gives you one, bud.

347
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,033
You know, Bonnie,

348
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:11,166
I had my first girl phase
around your age.

349
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,066
Let's see it, bud.

350
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,400
Is something weird
going on there, bud?

351
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:31,366
Boom! $20 fine!

352
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:34,033
Fisky.

353
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,100
‐What?
‐What?

354
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, I don't know what kind of

359
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,333
‐It's basic.
‐Don't step on the logo.

360
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:55,700
Live for the logo,
respect the logo!

361
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:59,300
‐Fisky.
‐Then why is it on the floor?

362
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,433
That brings me
to my next point.

363
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,900
‐Your jerseys.
‐Oh, yo, buddy.

364
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,266
You should call it
a sweater, buddy.

‐Don Cherry's orders.
‐Don Cherry, buddy.

366
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,800
Your sweater never ever
touches the floor.

367
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,200
Hang up the sweater.

368
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:14,866
Live for the sweater.

369
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,733
‐Respect the sweater.
‐Mmm.

370
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:19,366
REILLY: Boomtown!

371
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,100
You're not off the hook, bud.
Do you want us to trust you?

372
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,500
Do you want this team
to come together?

373
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,900
‐You want a fuckin' W?
‐Yeah!

374
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,466
Then we're gonna need
to see your junk, buddy.

375
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,933
Let's see your junk, buddy.

‐Team exercise? Team exercise.
‐Yeah. Yeah.

what has a guy have do
to get your attention?
