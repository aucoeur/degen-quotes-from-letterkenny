1
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:13,133
You were out gettin' good
with your pals
the other night.

2
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:16,100
It's been so long
since I've had a pair
of tits in my hands,

3
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:19,366
I popped a lap rocket
opening up a can of tuna
last Sunday morning.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,633
Oh, that's off‐putting.

5
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,400
Not to old Gail,
it isn't.

6
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:24,566
I'd love to hear your
big bang theory, Daniel.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,566
WAYNE: Ew.
Print it.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,366
This is officially me
callin' down for more mayo.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,666
That's clever.
GAIL: Do you like magic?

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,566
Pop that purple
home wrecker over here.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,700
I'll make her disappear.

12
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,200
We should
just be out there

13
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:41,100
just pole vaultin'
around town, boys.

14
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,800
Wouldn't say no
to a bit of toe curlin'
and I don't mean maybe.

15
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,800
GAIL: It won't be long
before you have the option.

16
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,633
College and university kids
will be home for the summer
next week.

17
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,433
Well, that should
help your spring fever.

18
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:53,100
Which is a serious condition
if not handled appropriately.

19

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,033
Yup. By all means, ladies.
Express yourselves.

21
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:00,500
Go easy down there,
Squirrely Dan.

22
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:03,066
I suffered severely
from the spring fever
last year,

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,166
had to go into
full cougar mode
with an 18‐year‐old.

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,166
Oh?
May have been
my second cousin.

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,500
Oh.

26
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,166
It was either that
or be at home flickin' it

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,000
to Grapefruit League
baseball highlights.

28
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,333
You know they're all
gonna be in here lookin'

29
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,566
for a bit of
"How's your father?"

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,466
Make sure your game
is tight or you'll
be home firing wristers.

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Firing what?

32
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:23,433
Oh.

33
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:25,200
What say we make
this interesting.

34
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:27,333
Whichever one of you
grabs a tail first

35
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:29,066
gets 50 bucks
off their bar tab.

36
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,333
In.

37
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:32,066
That is a Texas
sized 10‐4.

No, you two
get after it.

39
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:36,300
Here's a tip.

40
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,433
When the gettin's good
around here, stay close
to your pal Wayne.

41
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,400
Kid's got more spunk
than a hotel room
hand towel.

42
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:44,700
Well, here's a tip.
Don't fart in a spacesuit.

43
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:47,200
Here's a tip.
Don't sneeze when
you're taking a piss.

44
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,533
Here's a tip.
It's really hard to get tuna
out of your dick hole.

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,700
This place is about to be
crawling with snapper.

46
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:57,366
Let's hope
this is the last night

47
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,633
you'll be going home
to make a bald man puke.

48
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,800
You naturally
prefer companionship,

49
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:02,933
but I guess there's
a lot worse things

50
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:05,300
than playing a little one man
couch hockey in the dark.

76
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,600
It'd be pretty sick
to see Katy
up there again.

00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:18,433
So sick.

that's what I'm gonna do,

making pickled eggs
or pickled sausages?

Bear in mind there
is no wrong answer
to this question.

I'm gonna be posting up

Hard no.

Why don't you guys
wear belts?

92

'Cause we buy pants
that fucking fit.

93
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,366
Why would I buy
a piece of leather
that costs $25,

94
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,700
when I have a perfectly good
skate lace at home?

95
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,200
$25? No.

96

97
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,366

I go down to
the flea market
at St. Jacobs,

102
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,633
$25 could get you
at least five belts.

Yeah, a little gutty.

Correct.

Allegedly.

189

It would take more
than one guy
to fuck an ostrich.

190
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,598
We've heard

191
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:49,998
that it was
a sick ostrich.

192
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:52,765
Well, it would take
two guys to fuck an ostrich.
Three even.

Was that before
or after he dated
Kyle Schneidstiller's sister?

logic there?

with her hair?

That's called
a hair show.

get his attention,

What for?

So you notice more
about the way they look.

212

Like how her face is framed
with her hair up or down.

213

And also make you
think like...

00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:38,465
Well, I wouldn't
wanna touch it.

215
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:41,798
Well, yeah, I think
I would like to touch it.

Well, get after it.

far too much credit, my boy.

what, Gail?

I think you've got a case
of the spring fever.

290

Can I get you a drink?

291
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:20,532
Okay.

292
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:23,432
You see that one?

293
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:25,465
She's like a Middle Eastern
rebel army.

294
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:27,598
'Cause there's a political
uprising in my pants.

Get after it.

You see what she
just did?

300
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:42,465
Touched your back
and then, moved on?

301
00:11:42,498 --> 00:11:44,632
That's called the
unnecessary squeeze‐by.

302

Is that what
it's called?
Mmm‐hmm.

303
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:49,265
You noticed she had about
half a fuckin' soccer field
to get past

304
00:11:49,298 --> 00:11:51,498
but instead leaned in close,
got a bit handsy

305

a couple of shots first.

and I'll only tell you once.

468
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:34,051
You've got the pick
of the litter around here

469
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:35,584
so you may as well
get pickin'.

470
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:42,184
I've got this fifty bucks
and no one to claim it.

471
00:19:42,217 --> 00:19:43,451
What say we put it
in your jeans

472
00:19:43,484 --> 00:19:46,584
and see what else is
hangin' around in there
while we're at it?

473
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:48,151
No.

474
00:19:48,184 --> 00:19:51,251
Like what's in your jeans,
big fella?
Nothin'...

475
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:54,017
I mean it. Cripes,
I may not go down
in history,

476
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:55,751
but I'll go down on you.

477
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:59,551
Okay.
(CHUCKLING)
You want to do 68?

478
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:01,684
I'll help you clean up.
You'll go down on me?

479
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:03,517
And I'll owe you one.

480
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:05,584
Where's that rag?
There it is.

481
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:08,217
Wake up, big shoots
and really big shoots.

482
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:09,851
More hands
make less work.

483
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:11,184
Call me cake!

484
00:20:11,217 --> 00:20:13,217
'Cause I go straight
to your ass, cowboy.

485
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:18,784
There's cake?

486
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:21,051
No.

487
