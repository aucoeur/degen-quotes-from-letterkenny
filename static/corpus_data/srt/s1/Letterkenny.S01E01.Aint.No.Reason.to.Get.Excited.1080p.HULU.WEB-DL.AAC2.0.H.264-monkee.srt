KATY: Bye!

00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,260
Can't believe
your sister's still dating
these nut sacks.

Wayne.
How're you now?

00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:29,730
KATY: Good and you?
Not so bad.

00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,097
Hi, Katy.
Go home, Daryl.

8
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,836
Nice onesie.
Does it come in men's?

9
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,071
Oh, I think you cum
in men enough for all of us.

I think you better
come in my...

I mean,
you better come...

I think you better come say
that to his face,
you fucking hicks!

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,346
Nice execution.
You're doin' terrific.

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,314
Hey, I heard about
your break‐up, buddy.

15
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,283
She was your sweetie
for five years, right?

16
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,218
Your high school
sweetie, right?

17
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,120
What's it to ya?
Heard she cheated
on you, buddy.

18
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,355
That's a real kick
in the knackers, bro.

19
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,157
Just a real ouchie, bro.

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,292
It's too bad she taught you
not to fight anymore, buddy.

21
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,461
'Cause that's a fight
on sight for you and
her new guy, buddy.

Fourth line
for life, bro.

23
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,132
Maybe, if you'd ever been
in a real fight, you might not
be so keen for another.

24
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:06,767

with those shades or play

00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,384
Hold my spitter.

your spitter.
You're holding

stay there and eat it.

Welcome.

So, you talked to Angie yet?

65
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,970
It's been almost a month now.
Think you need to get
back on the horse.

66
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,606
She stepped out on you.
Can't go back to that
and get any respect.

67
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,807
Not in Letterkenny.

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,408
Wayne, Angie did
you a lot of good.

Somewhere along the way
you kinda got soft.

You're not even
fighting anymore.

Sex. With a girl.

Not just any girl.
A good Christian girl.

Look at this.

It's called Tinder.

83
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,346
Look, see there's all
these girls and if you
don't like one,

84
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,315
you just say nope
and move onto the next.

85
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,619
But if you do like one,
then you can see how
close they are

00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:39,986
and I don't know,
maybe meet up

or whatever.

88
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,357

type 'em out a message
or what's the scoop?

89
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,794
Yeah. You just, you know,
say something like...

90
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,967
Like, "On a scale of one
to America, how free
are you right now?"

story, Dan.

100
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,566
It's really more
of a Wayne story.

101
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,533
Yeah, but he
won't tell it.

102

Oh, you've heard it
a baker's dozen times.

103
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,403
Tell the story
or he won't shut up.

104

DAN: Is there anymore
trail mix?

It's in the house.

Yous makes the most delicious
trail mix, Katy,

107
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,478
and I got to say that's what
I appreciates about you.

108
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,980
Is that what you
appreciate about me?

Pitter‐patter, squirrely Dan.

So, as the story goes,

Wayne hucks an egg at a truck
with a Confederate flag

112

in the back windshield

113
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,055
and the driver's
fumin' pissed.

114
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:52,492
So, we flee the scene
goin' full tilt like
a Peterbilt, right?

115
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,762
Now, The Federales catch up
to us and chase us
through a few backyards

116
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,931
before we scamper up
into some trees

117
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,867
and all Wayne's got on
is a pair of
cut‐off jean shorts

118
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,870
so he ain't exactly
super jazzed about the
situation, was you Wayne?

119
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,672
Oh, I'm no DJ Jazzy Jeff.

120
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,273
The Federale
pulls out his Taser,

121
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,745
and he points it up at Wayne
and says some real
Clint Eastwood‐sounding shit.

122
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,213
He says to Wayne, he says,

123
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:17,350
"If I'd known I was going to
run into some uptown
street toughs today,

124
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,052
"I'd have done up
my top button."

125
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,987
(CHUCKLES) That's from
a John Wayne motion picture.

126
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:21,922
No, Cool Hand Luke.

127
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,090
Pert near anything
Kevin Costner, really.

128
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:27,928
Either way, I's impressed
and I'd let out
an audible gasp

129
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:32,065
so he hears me, spins around,
aims the Taser up at me
and lets fire,

130
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,635
and if that thing doesn't
latch onto my nipple ring,

131
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,870
which I'm pretty sure
amplified the
electric current,

132
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,672
he sent coursing through
my entire body.

133
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,007
And they just walked over
and yanked that thing
out of my nipple

134
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,809
like it was a goddamn
fish hook.

135
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,511
At least that's
according to my cousin.

136
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:45,946
Well, you know,
my second cousin.

Who, Garrett?
No, Jarrett.

138

Huh...
I cried.

139
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,951
I'm not even ashamed
to admit that.

141
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,755

deep in a bottle of
Gus'n Bru tonight.

It's a four leaf clover.
Make a wish.

146

and two Cold‐FX's.

Yeah, but 'cept
how many darts though?

162
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:49,610
Twenty, 25 darts.

'er down then?

you were on a pack
and a half of smokes.

165
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,980
Well, sometimes,
I'll have a pack
and a half of smokes,

166
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,181

two packs of smokes.

00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,654
this Sunday, for an

My sweetie, Margaret,
is a first class gal.

She's got some friends
she can introduce you to.

Margaret? Sounds like
a biddy old blue‐hair'd.

209
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:52,899
She's not. She's a very
focused young woman on the
path to eternity with Christ.

at the Burning Bush
might help him out.
