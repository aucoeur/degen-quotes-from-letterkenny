1
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:13,166
A bit of fuss down
at the church the other day.

2
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:16,333
Glen.
GLEN: Wayne.

3
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:17,700
How are you now?
GLEN: Good, and you?

4
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:19,233
Oh, not so bad.

5
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:21,100
Ooh, look what
you brought with you.

6
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:23,766
Hello, Daryl.
Oh, fuck.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,633
Fuck, you're naked
as a jay bird.

8
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,433
Wayne, it's humid.
It's the humidity.

9
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:29,700
Y'all might want to
think about doing
the same thing,

10
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:31,366
just pop your
pants right off,

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,233
that way no one
gets sticky.

12
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,566
Nope.
It's not so bad.
What's the fuss?

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,366
Ma O'Dell mentioned something
about you helping her get
a squirrel out of her attic.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,200
I'm faced with
a similar conundrum.

15
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:42,333
Right over there.

16
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:45,066
It seems some kinda
rodent's made his home
over there.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,766
I have not seen him,
but I sure can smell him.
(CHUCKLES)

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,233
(ANIMAL CHATTERING)
Hum.

19
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:55,666
(EXHALES)

20
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:57,800
It's a possum.
GLEN: Hmm.

21
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,066
DARYL: Possum.
WAYNE: That's right.

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,433
Oh, pitter patter,
let's get at 'er.

23
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:02,733
Do you wanna know what?
I'd reach into a
pirate hooker's chamber pot

24
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:04,600
before I'd reach in there.
And I'm going to tell ya.

25
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:06,766
Possums are immune
to snake venom.

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,633
They could probably survive
a nuclear blast.

27
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,266
I think it's pronounced
new‐cue‐lar.

28
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,133
Mmm, but it isn't.

29
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,133
They're mutants.
They have forked
fuckin' penises.

30
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,400
(SCOFFS)

31
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:16,533
We should all be so lucky.

32
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:18,500
They do this thing called
'Playing Possum'

33
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:21,166
where they appear dead and
emit a death stink from
their butt holes, fuck.

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,500
(SIGHS)
I found one
playing possum one time,

35
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,166
thought it was dead
and buried it.

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,566
It dug itself out
a few hours later

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,500
and fucked a hen
right in front of her chicks.

38
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:29,233
Wayne, think about
the swear jar.

39
00:01:29,266 --> 00:01:30,800
You're putting
so much money in.

40
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,300
All right, let me take
peek see?
Pitter‐patter.

41
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,400
Always had a skilled hand
in wrangling vermin.

42
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:37,633
Thank you, Daryl.
And that doesn't surprise me.

43
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:40,233
No sweat.
(GLEN LAUGHS) No sweat?

44
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:44,100
In this heat?
That is rich and it's funny.

45
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:46,533
Honestly though,
just take off your jumper.

46
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:49,333
I'll hold it for you.
You crawl up in there,
no one gets dirty.

47
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:51,066
Glen? Glen?
Yes.

48
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,366
Let's take about 20%
off 'er up there, all right?

49
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,166
Now, you wanna have an eye
because he'll come out
meaner and spit

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
and go like a hot damn.

51
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:09,566
Is he likely to bite?
Is a duck's ass watertight?

52
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,200
Get ready to give him the
size nine's if he jukes by me.

53
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:13,400
How be I give him the size
twelve and a halfs instead?

(CHATTERING)

55
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:19,100
Oh, I see him.
That's some drunk evolution
right there, bud.

56
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:21,633
You gotta wonder what
two Christ‐made miscreants
mated to make that.

57
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,600
It's almost not worth
thinkin' about.

58
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:26,066
Do I just reach for him?
That's a better idea
than going in head first.

59
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,533
Put him where?
Under my boot.

60
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:30,633
(GLEN SIGHS) Boys, just do
your best not to make too big
a mess, all right?

61
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,566
And I'm sorry again
about all this heat.

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,733
Whoo‐hoo!

63
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:36,233

Ow.

66
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:41,400
You wish there was a
Pied Piper for possums,

67
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:44,666
but there isn't, so you're
gonna have to just keep
pickin' 'em off with the .22.

68
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,400
Buckle up
'cause they're fuckin' ugly.

69
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:51,200
Of course, that's not to say
I have it all my damn self.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

71
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:08,633
Is that a herpe
on your hand, Daryl?

72
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:12,100
Did you pay a little extra
to go all the way with a
ripper in the back room again?

73
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,233
WAYNE: No, I don't think
he'd make that mistake twice.

74
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:15,700
Got a little
trouser trauma?

75
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,533
Was she fun
or was she fungal?

76

(LAUGHS)
Hey, guess what?

77
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,800
A guy's girlfriend
is having a hard time
parking the car, right?

78
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,333
He says,
"You should get tested."

79
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:24,800
She says, "Well no,
I'm not so bad at driving."

80
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,433
He says,
"No, I have chlamydia."

81
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:28,033
Is that a bite?

82
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,100
The guy takes
a hooker out for supper.

83
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,433
He gave her his peas,
she gave him herpes.

84

Daryl, what happened?

85
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:36,133
Did something bite you?

Where are Deetzy and Burnsy?

111

Oh, looks like a bad case
of the Native flu, bro.

What's the Native flu?
You're an idiot.

The Natives are
tough as hell.

is chicken‐shit to play them

scan them and then

00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,200
I was really impressed.

154
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,066
Guess those days
are over, though.

155
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,133
All right, Dairy, let's go.

156
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,033
Dairy, come on.

157
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,033
(STRUGGLING)

158
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,266
And yeah.

159
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,400
You did use to charm me.

160
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,433
McMurray, how're ya now?
Not so bad, and you?

161
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:10,233
Not so bad.
I see you back
to the jamboree, now.

162
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:12,366
A few weeks off there.
Oh, you noticed.

163
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,633
Well, it's hard not to notice
all that Scottish tartan plaid
you seem to enjoy so much.

164
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,666
I wanted to talk about
something important.

165
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,700
Okay.
My sister Bonnie
is back from college,

166
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:22,600
and she's a damn fine woman.

167
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,533
Oh, yeah.
I just seen her down
at the dollar store, there.

168
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:26,600
You sure it was her?

169
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:29,500
I mean, last time I seen her
last she was in a kind of
a DIY maxi dress,

170
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,433
but she may have added
a crochet pattern sweater
on account of the breeze.

171
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:35,466
Maybe autumn foliage
or an Algonquin green?

172
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
Okay.

173
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,266
I think she'd be a damn fine
match for you, Wayne.

174
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:41,433
That's if you're ready.

175
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:42,733
You know, 'cause of
Angie and all.

176
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:43,633
She's a lovely girl.

177
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400

(BOTH SPEAK)

180
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:52,266
No, you go ahead.
That is if you...

181
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,400
But you started,
you mind finishing?

182
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,466
Oh, it's just, was gonna say
the space, looks,

183
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,133
looks nice and clean
without the...

184
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,400
Yup.

185
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Run pretty good.

186
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,533
Well, all right. All right.
Yeah. Hey, uh,
I'll let you carry on.

187
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:07,366
It's a good box of ice. Yeah.
Yeah, good to see you.
Have a good one.

188
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:10,533
Hey, wait.

189
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:12,266
You save her dance now,
eh, big boy?

190
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,300
Good enough,
McMurray.

191
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,533
Atta boy.

192

(MUSIC PLAYING)

193
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,100
Does that taste right?

194
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,766
Ya, okay.

195
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,066
Mmm.

(SUCKING)

197
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:28,366
I think so, I don't know,
I don't know.

198
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,633
I've had an epiphany!

199
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:33,233
Uh, can you taste this?
No.

200
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:35,466
Never again.
Okay, okay, okay,
then, can you snort it?

201
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,400
No. I've given up
on the meth business.

202
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:40,200
I'm going back
to the turntables.

203
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:44,066
Hmm?
Back to the ones and twos.

204
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,533
DEVON: For what?

205
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:49,466
To become a superstar DJ.

206
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,133
DEVON:
Oh, okay, okay, uh...

207
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,800
But first, can you...
Let's just try...

208
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,133
No.

209
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:58,766
I need you guys to tell
everyone you know

210
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,533
that I am hosting
a rave in Letterkenny,

211
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:02,666
and I will be spinning
under all of my aliases.

212
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,100
How many aliases
have you had?

213
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,400
DJ Pimpy Longstockings,
DJ Peter Blumpkin,

214
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:10,566
DJ White Power Nap,
DJ White Power Bottom.

215
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,533
They'll all be there!
DEVON: All of them.

216
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:15,733
Mmm‐mmm, so you're quitting
the meth business?

217
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:18,633
I've quit the meth business.

218
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:24,400
But Menergy Spa is still like,
a thing though, right?

219
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,466
Well, how are you going
to get people to come?

220
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll post it on my
fuckin' Facebook.

221
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,566
And you guys will post it

222
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,733
on your fuckin' Facebooks.

223

KATY: Wayne.

224
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,333
Christ, Katy,
put some fuckin'
clothes on.

225
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:48,533
Not my forte.

226
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:49,400
Unfortunate.

227
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:52,266
What are you doing?

228
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,166
Well, I think it's
pretty obvious

229
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,133
that I'm moving hay bales
from here over to here.

230
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,066
Although, that one's
a straw bale.

231
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,400
Why?

232

(PHONE RINGING)

233
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:07,200
Well, pick up your

trying to reach you all day.

At least I was yesterday!

236
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:13,500
How're ya now?
Not so bad and you?

237
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,566
Not so bad.

238
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,400
Listen, Wayne.
I've gotta cancel
the Jamboree here.

239
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:17,633
The Ag Hall's been
booked up.

240
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,233
For the whole week?
Yes, sir.

241
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:22,800
That's Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday and guess what else?

242
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,433
Sunday.
What for?

243
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:26,800
Uh, Stewart.
He's throwing a rave.

244
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,100
I don't know, he says
he needs time to set up
or something like that.

245
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:31,366
Said something about a
glow stick Segway saunter

246
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,700

of Mario Kart for Nintendo 64?
I don't know, what the fuck.

247
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:37,233
And you green‐lit
that tom‐fuckery?

248
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:40,066
Had to. Agricultural Hall
is low on funds.

249
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,566
All‐day bookings
is a big boost for us.
So, I couldn't say no.

250
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,566
Agricultural Halls are
for Agricultural music.

251

Not for fuckin' raves.

that's just silly.

and I'm gonna tell ya.

and let 'em loose
at Stewart's rave.

How do we get the word out
about the business?

Oh, you'd have to put it
on your fuckin' Facebook,
likely.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

309
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:20,794
Devon, we're missing $2000.

310
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:23,194
Really?
It's a devastating blow to
Menergy Spa, I know.

311
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:26,127
Hey, I'll call Stewart.

312
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,327
(MUMBLING)
He'll fix everything...

313
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,794
(PHONE RINGING)

314
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,027
Hello?
Stewart?

315
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,127
Hey, Devon.

316
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,294
Hey, we're missing 2k.
Yeah, I took it
for the rave.

317
00:13:37,994 --> 00:13:39,360
2k?

318
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:41,794
(STAMMERS)
I don't think
you understand.

319
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:45,327
It's going to be
a massive production.

320
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,460
It's gonna be
like an...

321
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,460
Aurora Borealis‐themed
Salvador Dali drug orgy

322
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:52,460
with shamans.

323
00:13:54,027 --> 00:13:56,060
(STAMMERING) But that's a
lot of money.

324
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:57,694
No time,
I gotta go.

325
00:14:04,294 --> 00:14:06,194
Wayne. Daryl.

326
00:14:06,227 --> 00:14:07,160
Gailor, how are ya now?

327
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:08,427
I'm on a juice cleanse.

328
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,427
Haven't had a drink
in three days.

329
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,860
Had close to
30 shits, though.

330
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:12,994
So what's the fuss?

331
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:14,960
Well, timing's right
for your new business.

332
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:16,960
Saw it up on your
fuckin' Facebook, there.

333
00:14:16,994 --> 00:14:18,760
Got a skunk sleeping
underneath us, right now.

334
00:14:18,794 --> 00:14:21,160
Did you not know skunks
are immune to bee stings?

335
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,994
They even teach their babies
how to raid beehives.

336
00:14:24,027 --> 00:14:25,894
And?
Well, they burrow up
for the winter,

337
00:14:25,927 --> 00:14:27,794
and rip farts on each other
to keep warm.

338
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:29,327
No way.
Oh, yeah.

339
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,160
They go to mate as soon
as they leave their mom,

340
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:34,727
so you know they're
probably thinking about her
during sex.

341
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,394
That or their brothers
and sisters which is
even more inappropriate.

342
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:39,127
(GAIL FARTING) Oh.

343
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,860
There's one knocking.
Make way.

344
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:47,360
Well, pitter‐patter.

345
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:51,260
Can you take this one,
please?

346
00:14:51,294 --> 00:14:53,860
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Here's the deal.

347
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:57,127
Stewart's rave is eating up
all our money,

348
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,460
and the business is failing
without his expertise.

349
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:03,360
We simply aren't making
enough coin selling
the Native's cigarettes.

350
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,260
We need the meth.

351
00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:07,860
Menergy Spa is never
going to happen at this rate.

352
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:10,760
I officially move to
boycott Stewart's rave,

353
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:14,327
take it off our
fuckin' Facebooks
and sabotage it.

354
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,994
All in favor say,
"Aye!"

355
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:18,960
EVERYONE: Aye!

356
00:15:18,994 --> 00:15:20,460
It's unanimous.

357
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,294
How are we
going to do this?

358
00:15:22,327 --> 00:15:23,860
We could put something
on our Facebooks.

359
00:15:25,394 --> 00:15:27,194
We could say the Ag Hall
has asbestos.

360
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,927
Yes, asbestos.

361
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,360
Everyone hates asbestos.
Asbestos is the answer.

362
00:15:31,994 --> 00:15:33,427
Okay.

363
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,827
Let's do that.

364
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,394
Maybe you don't say
asbestos anymore, though.

365
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:39,894
Okay.

366
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:53,760
Hey, Katy,
you look beautiful.

367
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:56,727
You look better.

368
00:15:57,327 --> 00:15:58,827
Um.

369
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,294
I've come to cordially
invite you to my rave tonight.

370
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:03,794
(ANIMAL CHATTERING)

371
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,194
Stewart.

372
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:09,860
Fuck, greasiest skid I
ever seen.

373
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:11,994
Criss Angel mind‐freak‐
looking‐motherfucker.

374
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:13,960
What are you thinking
holding a rave at the Ag Hall?

375
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:17,127
I'm thinking I'm doing
the Agricultural Society
a huge favor.

376
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,727
You guys are going broke.
Tits up or not,
it's inappropriate.

377
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,060
Why not the Legion?

378
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:22,460
Or even upstairs
at the arena?

379
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:24,127
Or the fuckin'
youth center.

380
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,794
Because they're too small,
shirt‐tucker.

381
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:30,060
Be prepared, because once
this blows up they'll probably
ask me to do it quarterly.

382
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:32,094
Bi‐weekly!

383
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:33,760
Mmm‐hmm.
Mmm‐hmm.

384
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:35,727
We'll see if it
blows up then.

385
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,494
It'll probably be pretty tough
to find me through the crowd.

386
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:42,894
Stage security will be
pretty tight but your name's
on the guest list,

387
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:46,060
and there's
a backstage pass
with your name on it.

388
00:16:46,094 --> 00:16:47,327
I'll do my best to
make it down, Stewart.

389
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,427
My ass.

390
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,160
And just as a heads up,
it is a rave,

391
00:16:51,194 --> 00:16:53,960
so there will probably be
people on drugs.

392
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:55,794
You know, MDMA.

393
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:58,094
What? There's gonna be
MDMA at the Ag Hall?

394
00:16:58,127 --> 00:17:00,394
Yes, there will be MDMA
at my rave at the Ag Hall.

395
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:03,394
There will be MDMA,
DMT, PCP, LSD,

396
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:05,727
LED and probably UFC.

397
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,960
But I am clean
and sober.

398
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:15,027
You are spare parts,
aren't you, bud?

to see you there.

in that pud, hey, boys?

408
00:17:58,294 --> 00:17:59,994
Put 'em away like a
winter coat, boys.

409
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:05,260
What the fuck
was that?

410
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:08,194

You want to get dropped off
at the splash pad
on the way home, eh?

416
00:18:20,827 --> 00:18:23,160

to pick you up after
you all swim?
