1
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:11,400
You were huckin'
the ball around

2
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:12,666
with your pals
the other day...

3
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:15,266
Say, uh...

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,800
What's the deal with your
sweetie there, Squirrely Dan?

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,300
Well, I took her
out last night.

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,166
‐Where to?
‐Outs to the chip truck.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,466
‐Fries and gravy?
‐I had mine with gravy.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,466
She had hers with
salts and malts vinegar.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,066
Do you know that
salt and malt vinegar's

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,200
a non‐traditional way
to dress your French fries

11
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:30,333
in the United States?

12
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:31,766
What the fuck
is wrong with them?

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,500
Like malt vinegar
is not a staple condiment

14
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,600
on tabletops in restaurants
in the United States.

15
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:36,700
Fuck, figure it out.

16
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,266
That's what I say.
I say, figure it out.

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,200
Got no vinegars on the tables,
no Krafts peanut butters.

18
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:41,666
WAYNE: Figure it out.
DARYL: Fuckin' figure it out.

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,700
Better not forget those
fuckin' all‐dressed chips.

20
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:45,566
No ketchup chips neither.

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,333
WAYNE: Figure it out.

22
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:48,800
Somebody really
ought to write a letter.

23
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,333
They do got six different
types of Cap'n Crunch, though.

24
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:52,566
How do you know that?

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,033
Saw a comedian talks about it
on the <i>Juste Pour Rires.</i>

26
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:56,333
Can't remember
his name, though.

27
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:57,533
Good guy, though?

28
00:00:57,566 --> 00:00:58,700
A little long‐winded
for my taste.

29
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:00,333
But, yeah,
a pretty good guy.

30
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:01,366
Well, glad to hear
he's a good guy at least.

31
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,366
They have running water
down there?

32
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:04,633
Anyhoo,

33
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,466
the evening went
so well that, uh,

34
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,733
we got up to a little bits
of a foolin' around.

35
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:09,566
Did you French her?

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,333
WAYNE: Kind of
out of line there, Dary.

37
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:12,600
Did you go up her shirt?

38
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:13,700
Now you're really
out of line, Dary.

39
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:16,233
We did French,
that much I will reveal.

40
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:17,733
Well, you already
revealed that much,

41
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:19,433
might as well just tell us
if you went up her shirt.

42
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:21,600
It's impolite
to kiss and tell, Dary.

43
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:24,066
I don't like to
kiss and tell, but...

44
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,633
The Frenchin's tooks
a hard left turn,

45
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,066
from which I have
yets to recover.

46
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,800
Do you wanna know what?

47
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,033
I'm not asking you
to kiss and tell,

48
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:34,266
'cause that's impolite.

49
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,300
But...

50
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:37,666
I'm kind of curious.

51
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,500
Yeah, Dan, kiss and tell.

52
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:43,066
I'm sure you boys have had
a couple of curve balls

53
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,100
thrown your way
betwixt the sheets.

54
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:49,566
Well, not to be impolite, but,

55
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,300
you know, sometimes
a gal will be kissin' around

56
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,533
on, like, the area
near your genitals,

57
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:57,100
but not quite
on your genitals.

58
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:58,500
Makes me ticklish
and insecure.

59
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,200
You know,
not to be impolite,

60
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:04,666
but sometimes a gal will do
some kissin' on the ears,

61
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,033
which makes me uncomfortable,

62
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:07,433
because even though
I clean my ears,

63
00:02:07,466 --> 00:02:09,366
sometimes a tater will just
roll out of there unexpected.

64
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,333
(CHUCKLES)

65
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,233
I kind of likes
both those things.

66
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:15,733
Yeah, it's why you're called
"Squirrely Dan."

67
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:17,400
Yeah, reason
fuckin' five million.

68
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:20,500
Well, nots to be
impolite, but...

69
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,066
This gal suggested that

70
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:27,366
maybe I should have some

71
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,033
attentions paid

72
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:33,200
to my butts hole.

73
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,366
That ever...

74
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,766
Ever happen to you guys?

75
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,033
Did you ever have a gal
suggest that you need

76
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,133
some attentions paid

77
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,333
to your butts holes?

78
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,100
I'll take that as a hard no,
I guess?

79
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:06,500
She put a couple of fingers
up there and...

80
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:10,100
It turns out you got a...

81
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,600
An erogenous zone up there.

82
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:14,100
Found...
Found the hot button and...

83
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,066
Gaves it a tickle and, uh...

84
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,166
Yeah. Feels, uh...

85
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,666
It feels pretty good,
you guys, okay?

86
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,500
‐Pop fly.
‐I really liked it.

87
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:33,133
It felt...
Felt very natural.

88
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:38,433
Nice.

89
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:40,100
That's how you get
the body in front of it.

90
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,166
Get the body in front of it.

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,766
They call it
"milking the prostate."

92
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:47,433
Well, it's impolite
to kiss and tell.

93
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,333
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

94
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,766
‐Where's Stewart been, Katy?
‐He's not talking to me.

95
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,533
‐Why?
‐I don't know.

96
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:09,266
Here are your birthday
pancakes, big brother.

97
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,566
Don't fuck with tradition.

98
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,633
‐Thank you.
‐You're welcome.

99
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,200
BOTH: Happy birthday, Wayne.

100
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:15,100
Jinx. You owe me
a Coke.

101
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,433
Well, see now, that
you can get in the States.

102
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,266
What you can't get, though,
is Crush Cream Soda.

103
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,333
BOTH: We got you
a present, Wayne.

104
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:21,800
Two Cokes.

105
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,366
We don't make a thing of
birthdays in this family.

106
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,733
Can we skip my super‐soft
birthday party then this year?

107
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:26,400
Hard no!

108
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,100
It's not a birthday thing,
it's an efficiency thing.

109
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,566
Uh, if you can be one thing,
you should be efficient.

110
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
We got you an appointment
with a matchmaker.

111
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,366
Get the... Take a...

112
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
Well, start walkin'.

113
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:36,166
Well, you won't
do online dating.

114
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,333
There's no more MoDeans,
so you can't meet girls there.

115
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:39,600
You're handcuffed, cowboy.

116
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:41,066
‐Figure it out.
‐Yeah, figures it out.

117
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,166
Don't you tell me
to figure it out.

118
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,566
Yous are the ones
should figure it out.

119
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,233
All you have to do is
sit down with a matchmaker,

120
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,700
answer a few questions,

121
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,600
and then she sets you up
on three dates with girls

122
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:49,733
that she thinks
you'll jive with.

123
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:51,400
Has anyone heard
from Jivin' Pete lately?

124
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:52,800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

125
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,466
No, Jivin' Pete's one nut
got all swole up...

126
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,433
I don't give a shit about
Jivin' Pete's one nut.

127
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:58,266
No, no, this is a story about
Jivin' Pete's other nut.

128
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,533
Yeah, Jivin' Pete's
had himself

129
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,366
a botched vasectomy
a little while back,

130
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,733
so now his one nut's
there all swole up

131
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:04,800
bigger than the first nut
that was all swole up.

132
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,533
If you can believes
that nonsense.

133
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:07,800
Was Jivin' showin' it
to people again?

134
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,600
Oh, he's showin' it to people.
I seen it.

135
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:11,266
‐You seen it, Dary?
‐Oh, I seen it.

136
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,133
‐Yeah, I never seen it.
‐It looks like a rambutan.

137
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,033
Which is to say,
this hairy fruit.

138
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,166
So, not smooth
like a persimmon?

139
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,333
DAN: No, although it is about
the size of a persimmons.

140
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:20,133
Which, of course,
is much like a tomatoes.

141
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,133
What sort of potent peace pipe
was some prick pulling off

142
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,433
when he titled
tomatoes "fruits"?

143
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,600
Well...

144
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:27,733
Now both Jivin' Pete's nuts
have a story,

145
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:30,366
which I hope guarantees
that I'll never have to listen

146
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,533
to another story about
Jivin' Pete's nuts.

147
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,333
‐He's a good guy.
‐He's a real good guy.

148
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:35,633
‐No, he's a great guy.
‐Wayne.

149
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,700
You're looking for love.

150
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,200
And you said it yourself,

151
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,066
"If you can be one thing,
be efficient."

152
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,233
Do's it once, do's it rights.

153
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,466
‐Figures it out.
‐Pitter patter,

154
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,766
let's get at 'er,
figure it out.

155
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,433
You shouldn't gang up
on people on their birthdays.

156
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:47,466
We don't make a thing
of birthdays in this family.

157
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,733
She's comin' this afternoon.

158
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,200
Don't be in your
barnin' clothes.

159
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,366
(SPOON SCRAPING)

160
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,133
I fuckin' hate praccy, bro.

161
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,700
It's Senior‐A whale shit, bro.
Why even praccy?

162
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,700
Like, I'm just gonna praccy
like a donkey.

163
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,066
I could donk all day.

164
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,100
Just blast clappers
at the hash marks

165
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,466
at the fuckin' plug tendy
of ours.

166
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,166
Clappys from the hashys,
buddy.

167
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,700
Just steppin' into one
from the ladies' tees.

168
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,300
Just bulldoze that speed bump.

169
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,600
Just firin' ringers
at his ears.

170
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:14,733
Just firin' warm‐up ringers.

171
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:16,766
Just tossin' chest‐high sauce
at the boys.

172
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,233
Just tossin' ankle‐high
rocket sauce.

173
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:20,700
Just tossin' mad sui's
up the middle.

174
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:22,366
Just tossin' mad sui's
through the trolley tracks.

175
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,133
Just tossin' mad
breakout sui's

176
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,300
directly into the skates.

177
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,133
Just tossin' mad
breakout sui's.

178
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:30,433
You know, it might be
a fun praccy after all.

179
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,433
I could donk all day, boys.

180
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:33,766
(MUTTERING)

181
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:41,333
I don't think I've ever
sat on a hay bale before.

182
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:44,066
That's a straw bale,
and that's barley.

183
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,066
Wonderful.

184
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,566
Great. Um...

185
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,133
So, a little bit about me.

186
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,766
Uh, my service is called

187
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,200
"Goldilocks and
the Three Dates."

188
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:55,333
Katy...

189
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:57,266
I forgot to tell her
not to tell you that.

190
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,633
So, I've modeled my business

191
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,700
after the charming story
that it's inspired by.

192
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:04,233
I send my clients
on three dates,

193
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:07,500
and like the beds that
Goldilocks laid down in

194
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:10,633
after eating the three
bears' porridge,

195
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:15,766
maybe one is "too hard,"
and maybe one is "too soft."

196
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,466
But in the end we hope
that maybe one is just right.

197
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,666
Katy...

198
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,100
Get after it.
You're losin' him.

199
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,466
Okay. Wayne,
why don't you just

200
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,200
tell me a little bit
about yourself.

201
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:29,233
It's impolite
to talk about yourself.

202
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:32,333
Keeps his truck clean.
Loves his dogs.

203
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:34,400
Enjoys a beer and a smoke.

204
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,400
Beer...
Beer and smoke.

205
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:38,266
That's... Wow, you know.

206
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,700
I get it. Rustic.

207
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,133
Trucks, got it.

208
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,366
We will make this work.
I love it, okay.

209
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,066
And then, um, Wayne,
can you just tell me

210
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,466
a little bit about
your past relationship?

211
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,433
You shouldn't air
your dirty laundry.

212
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,266
Five years.
Ended a while ago.

213
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,466
No baggage.

214
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,433
No baggage, love that.
No baggage, no babies.

215
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:57,133
Likey.
(LAUGHING)

216
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,233
This is fun.

217
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:02,200
I'm having a fun time
in this place.

218
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:03,533
And, Wayne,
can you tell me

219
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,766
how much you make
in a fiscal year?

220
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,066
WAYNE: Katy!

221
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,633
It's impolite to talk
about your money.

222
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,766
He's no slouch.

223
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,600
Okay. Touche.

224
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:14,466
Well, I'm about
to begin your story.

225
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,233
Where maybe one is "too hard."

226
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:20,600
Maybe one is, um...

227
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,100
‐But in the end...
‐Yeah, you lost him.

228
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,633
He seems...
He seems nice.

229
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,533
Do you live...

230
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:30,733
Do you live in here?

231
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:33,066
So, what did you think of

232
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,066
Goldilocks and the Three Dates
there, Wayne?

233
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,633
Ready to fall in Goldi‐love?

234
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,466
Or Goldi‐lust?

235
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,200
You won't be Goldi‐laughin'
when I break your Goldi‐legs.

236
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:43,500
Dim the Goldi‐lights?

237
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:46,200
Nights of your Goldi‐life?

238
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,433
Use your Goldi‐language.
Make her Goldi‐laugh.

239
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:49,766
Make it Goldi‐last.

240
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,300
Better Goldi‐lay off,
before they find

241
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,733
your Goldi‐limbs
in a Goldi‐landfill,

242
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,733
Goldi‐literally.

243
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,133
Take her on a Goldi‐lunch?

244
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,700
Maybe a Goldi‐late suppers?

245
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,066
‐Maybe she's a Goldi‐lawyer.
‐Ooh.

246
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,266
You think I'm Goldi‐lyin'?
Enough Goldi‐lip.

247
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,133
A Goldi‐longshoresman
will find your bodies

248
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,233
in the Goldi‐lake!

249
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:11,166
Gentlemen, a question.
A query.

250
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,066
‐An inquis...
‐Pitter patter.

251
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,700
Has Katy mentioned anything
about me not talking to her?

252
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:19,066
‐Can confirm.
‐Major league.

253
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,433
‐It's working.
‐What's working?

254
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:22,066
By not talking to her,
she will form the conclusion

255
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,666
that I'm upset with her
and eventually ask me why.

256
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,133
Why you so butt‐hurt, Stewart?

257
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,700
‐Well, she acts like...
‐Just kidding.

258
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,233
‐I don't give a fuck.
‐DAN: Wait.

259
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:31,300
So, you're upsets with her,

260
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,300
and you wanna communicate that
by not communicatings?

261
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,100
Acutely.

262
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:38,166
You are spare parts,
aren't you, bud?

263
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,466
Let me know
if Katy asks about me.

264
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,166
Heads up!

265
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,266
Ow!

266
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:51,200
(MUSIC PLAYING)

267
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:03,166
I'm Kim.

268
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,500
I'm a psychologist
and a feminist.

269
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:06,266
‐I'll be paying the bill.
‐I'm Wayne.

270
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,200
Wayne!

271
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,466
Glen.
How are you now?

272
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,600
‐Ah, good and you?
‐Oh, not so bad.

273
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:14,133
Well, I guess the kitten's
out of the clutch on this one.

274
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,300
I also have
to work as a waitress

275
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,366
to make ends meet.

276
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,766
‐WAYNE: Sure you do.
‐I'm Kim.

277
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,066
Are you ever.

278
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,533
Look at you.
I'm lovin' this.

279
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:23,366
You're like a shark.
I'm scared.

280
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,500
Like a Julie Moore,
or like a Jessie Chastain.

281
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:27,766
‐What can I get you to drink?
‐Uh, we'll need a minute.

282
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,066
Uh, please and thank you.

283
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,200
Hmm. All right.

284
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,166
Well, you'll take care of
little Miss Nicki Kidman here

285
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,033
till I get back,
Mr. McConaughey?

286
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:36,233
‐Sure, I will.
‐All right.

287
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,033
He crosses his arms.

288
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:42,100
Are you aware of
the psychology behind that?

289
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:43,166
Now, when you say "he,"

290
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,566
you're talking
about me, right?

291
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,133
He has wit.

292
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,633
Do you know why
you cross your arms?

293
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,700
Feels like you're talking
to two people right now.

294
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,266
Crossing your arms,

295
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,600
whether it be consciously
or subconsciously,

296
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:54,100
is a sign of defense.

297
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,700
You're protecting
your vital organs.

298
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,033
Do you feel threatened by me?

299
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:58,700
Well, I don't,
but the other guy might.

300
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,733
He is hilarious.

301
00:11:00,766 --> 00:11:02,533
Enough psychology for now.

302
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:04,500
What do you know
about feminism, Wayne?

303
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,800
I know it's unsafe territory
to discuss with a feminist.

304
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,433
‐Why?
‐Someone will start shoutin'.

305
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:10,300
‐Why?
‐I don't know.

306
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,433
Feminism is the belief
that women and men

307
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,733
should have equal rights
and opportunities.

308
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:16,600
So, are you a feminist, Wayne?

309
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:18,233
Well, I trust my sister

310
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:20,800
with just about any job
under the sun over a man.

311
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,700
‐But 'cept this one, I guess.
‐Excuse me?

312
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:25,266
Not to be impolite but you're
not exposed to talk about sex,

313
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,733
politics or religion
at the supper table.

314
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:30,200
(SIGHING)
What do you want, Wayne?

315
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:32,800
‐I'd have a Gus'n Bru, likely.
‐Not what I'm asking.

316
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,566
What's a Gus'n Bru?

317
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,433
Ooh!
I'll google it and find out.

318
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,166
I'm kiddin'.
I know exactly what it is.

319
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,600
But we don't have any.

320
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:40,800
So, what can
I get you to drink?

321
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,100
I'll have a Caesar
and he'll have a...

322
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,466
Pint of lager, please.
Something local.

323
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,733
‐Thank you.
‐GLEN: All right.

324
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:47,766
So, a local lager
for Mr. Brando

325
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,566
and a Caesar
for Sandy Bullock.

326
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,433
I love those orders.
Be right back.

327
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,600
I didn't think they'd have it
at Four Dancers.

328
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:57,333
Yes, I didn't think they'd
have it at this resto‐bar.

329
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,600
‐Gastro‐pub.
‐Says "resto‐bar" on the sign.

330
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,200
It's more of a micro‐bistro.

331
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,333
Says brasserie on the menu
right there, too.

332
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:05,166
It's more of
a bistro‐brasserie.

333
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,600
When I came in
they asked me if I wanted

334
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,500
to sit at the resto‐bar
or the gastro‐lounge.

335
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:10,066
I'm glad you chose
the resto‐bar.

336
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,566
This is actually
the gastro‐lounge.

337
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:16,733
Do you know what
an emergency call is, Wayne?

338
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:18,766
‐Negative.
‐It's when you have a friend

339
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,533
call 10, 15 minutes
into a date

340
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:23,366
to be sure the date
isn't a total bust.

341
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,066
And if it is, then you can
play the phone call

342
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,166
as though it's an emergency
and leave the date.

343
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,500
Well, that's fair.

344
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:30,766
I guess we are first cousin
to an emergency here.

345
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,200
A good one.

346
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:34,066
And you shouldn't
be afraid of it.

347
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,000
I think we could do
good things here.

348
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:39,033
I'm going to call my friend

349
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:41,500
and cancel
her pending emergency call,

350
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,466
and when I get back,

351
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,666
let's talk about
your feelings, Wayne.

352
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,066
‐Okay.
‐Let's really talk about them.

353
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,233
‐Okay.
‐I wanna take 'em,

354
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:53,000
and I wanna talk about them.

355
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:12,233
Oh, it's Wayne.
How are you now?

356
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:14,100
Oh, not so bad.

357
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, this one's too hard.

Well played.
Wait it out.

That way she'll come
to the conclusion that

374
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:03,413
you're upset with her
and ask you why.

375
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:05,513
‐Precisely.
‐She should anyway.

376
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:07,180
‐If she's smart.
‐I know.

‐Why are you mad at her?
‐She acts like...

You should try
an open relationship.

379
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:12,547
Could be productive.

380
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,780
You could also
try a hall pass.

As a policy.

441
00:16:31,813 --> 00:16:33,780
Well, so what happens
when they come see you?

442
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:36,480
Well, we do things a little
differently in our program.

443
00:16:36,513 --> 00:16:39,113
The approach is progressive
and positive.

444
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:41,047
We issue
a hug consent form to parents,

445
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,513
which allows us
to hug their kids.

446
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:46,847
Because 99% of the time,
all kids need is a hug.

447
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,913
‐"A hug"?
‐A squeeze.

448
00:16:47,947 --> 00:16:48,980
Well, you squeeze 'em.

449
00:16:49,013 --> 00:16:50,180
‐An embrace.
‐Oh.

450
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:51,813
‐Oh?
‐Well...

451
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:53,047
‐What is it?
‐Nothin'.

00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,280
‐Wayne.
‐Yeah?

453
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,313
‐Speak freely.
‐No, I'd better not.

454
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:58,880
That's the only way
we'll get to know each other.

455
00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:00,313
But do you ever smack 'em?

456
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:02,513
‐Excuse me?
‐Like, give 'em a good whack?

457
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:05,447
‐I don't follow.
‐Do you ever hit the kid?

458
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,313
Like, for being too silly.

459
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:09,213
No! Wayne.

460
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,913
We never hit our kids.
You shouldn't hit kids.

461
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,080
Well, you know what,

462
00:17:13,113 --> 00:17:14,513
don't you remember
how scared you were

463
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:16,180
of your principal
when you were growing up?

464
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:17,447
It's 'cause he'd smack you
if you were being too silly.

465
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,880
Like your parents
wanted you

466
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,213
to have a principal
who would smack you.

467
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,813
They took comfort in the fact

468
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:23,047
that they were sending you
to a place every day

469
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,847
where someone would
smack you for them

470
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,047
if you were being
too silly.

471
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,313
And sometimes
I see kids these days,

472
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,347
I kind of think, like...

473
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,280
Like, wish you could
still do that.

474
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:33,513
That sort of discipline
is long outdated, Wayne,

475
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:34,980
and frowned upon.

476
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,047
We sit the child down...

477
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,813
‐That's another problem.
‐What is?

478
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:39,380
‐In my opinion.
‐Sitting?

479
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:41,147
Well, no wonder
kids are failin' school,

480
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,413
just sittin' around all day.

481
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:44,013
Stand up,
you're not doing nothin'.

482
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:45,313
You think sitting
is a problem?

483
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:46,780
‐Yeah.
‐Why?

484
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:48,147
'Cause it makes you soft.

485
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,147
‐Literally or figuratively?
‐Well, both, I suppose.

486
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,913
‐Both?
‐Yeah.

487
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,280
In my opinion.

488
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:55,413
My phone's buzzing.

489
00:17:57,913 --> 00:17:59,947
Well, so you like cookies
and cream ice cream, hey?

490
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,147
Well, I think
it's pretty good, too.

491
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,347
Hi, Michelle.

492
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:04,147
Oh, no.

493
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,380
Okay,
I'll be right there.

494
00:18:06,413 --> 00:18:08,113
I'm sorry, Wayne,
I've gotta go.

495
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:09,947
‐It's...
‐An emergency.

496
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,180
‐Yeah.
‐Okay.

497
00:18:23,547 --> 00:18:25,180
It's Wayne.

498
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:26,780
Well, how are you now?

499
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:28,180
Oh, not so bad.

500
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:29,947
Yeah, this one's too soft.

I'm not talking to you.

00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,280
Super.

510
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:12,147
‐(SIGHS)
‐It's been three days.

511
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,847
Why haven't you asked me
what's wrong?

512
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,213
‐Something wrong?
‐Of course it is.

513
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:18,780
‐You act like I don't...
‐Should I have known that?

514
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:20,447
It's called
"the silent treatment."

515
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,313
Step one,
I stop talking to you.

516
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:23,913
Step two,
you form the conclusion

517
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:25,047
that something is wrong.

518
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,413
Step three,
you ask me what's wrong.

519
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:28,813
What's up with step one?

520
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:30,047
You've skipped
step one and two.

521
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,780
What's step three again?

522
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:33,880
You ask me what's wrong!

523
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:34,913
Got it.

524
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:36,847
Good.

525
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
You bet.

526
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:40,980
Go ahead.

527
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,947
Where?

528
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,913
‐Step three.
‐What's step three again?

529
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:46,313
(EXHALES)

530
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:48,147
We'll skip step three.

531
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,880
I'm just going to tell you
what's wrong.

532
00:19:49,913 --> 00:19:51,213
That should have
been step one.

533
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:53,880
Wrong. Step one and two
are fundamental steps.

534
00:19:53,913 --> 00:19:56,113
You missed steps, Stewart.

535
00:19:56,147 --> 00:19:57,513
How?

536
00:19:57,547 --> 00:20:00,080
Step one,
become angry with someone.

537
00:20:00,113 --> 00:20:03,180
Step two, tell that someone
that you're angry.

538
00:20:03,213 --> 00:20:05,913
Step three, resolve anger
with that someone.

539
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:07,547
‐Step four...
‐(SCOFFING) Step four.

540
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,813
Step four,
resume peaceful existence.

541
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:16,947
Your logic is
frighteningly bewitching.

542
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,447
Phantasmagoric.

543
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,080
It's time for you to go.

544
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:23,413
What?

545
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,380
Where?

546
00:20:25,413 --> 00:20:26,413
Leave here?

547
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:28,780
It was a rebound.

548
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:30,880
Even though there was no
physical act of rebounding,

549
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:32,280
which is a first for me.

No one has time for
the silent treatment, Stewart.

554
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:43,947
Not even in Letterkenny.

555
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,147
Adios.

‐Have at 'er.

Well, let's hear it,
good buddy.

617

Now, my question.

618
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:27,413
When have you ever
heard a girl go,

619
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,913
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."

620
00:23:28,947 --> 00:23:31,013
‐Well...
‐Other than in a porno.

621
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:33,780
‐I don't believe I have.
‐Me neithers.

622
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,347
That's because
we don't say that.

623
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,247
‐Well...
‐Not unless it's in a porno.

624
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,413
WAYNE: Now my comment.

625
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:40,380
You see, the way Dary did the
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's"

626
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:42,813
is not the way they do
the "yes, yes, yes" in pornos.

627
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:44,147
That's the way they do it.

628
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,047
The girl gets all excited,
and she goes,

629
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,347
"Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes."

630
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,213
Yes, but the way you're doing
the "yes, yes, yes, yes's"

631
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:53,013
is not the way they do
the "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."

632
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:54,813
DARYL: It is the way
they do it.

633
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:57,147
They go,
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."

634
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,180
That's exactly
how they do it.

635
00:23:58,213 --> 00:23:59,447
WAYNE: No, they don't.

636
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,413
What they do is
they find a super‐high pitch

637
00:24:00,447 --> 00:24:01,913
for those first four yes's.

638
00:24:01,947 --> 00:24:02,780
And then
they come in all dramatic

639
00:24:02,813 --> 00:24:03,947
for that final "yes."

640
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,447
So, it goes a little something
like, "Yes, yes, yes, yes."

641
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,480
And then they
get all dramatic

642
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:07,547
for that final "yes."

643
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,447
Say, "Yes! Oh."

644
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,880
I don't think that's
how they do it.

645
00:24:10,913 --> 00:24:12,047
I'd have to hears it again.

646
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,913
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"

647
00:24:14,947 --> 00:24:16,880
Yeah.
Yeah, porno girls do that.

648
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,080
But only when
the porno guys

649
00:24:18,113 --> 00:24:20,313
aren't busy finding
some super‐low tone

650
00:24:20,347 --> 00:24:22,347
and repeating
over and over again,

651
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,947
"Ah, fuck.

652
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,780
"Ah, fuck."

653
00:24:25,813 --> 00:24:27,480
I takes a bit offense to that,
Miss Katy,

654
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:29,180
as I have
a naturally low voice,

655
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:31,347
and I do likes to say,
"Ah, fuck.

656
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,780
"Ah, fuck."

657
00:24:32,813 --> 00:24:34,080
Exceptin' I don't
do it in pornos.

658
00:24:34,113 --> 00:24:35,413
Well, then you should
do voiceovers

659
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:37,047
for English‐dubbed
foreign pornos, Dan,

660
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,247
because that was a text book
"ah, fuck, ah, fuck."

661
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,380
Why thank you, Miss Katy.

662
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,447
I've never had
any complaints from

663
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,880
any of my sexual companions

664
00:24:43,913 --> 00:24:46,813
about my
"ah, fuck, ah, fuck."

665
00:24:48,213 --> 00:24:49,447
KATY: Let me hear yours, Dary.

666
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,013
Well, I...
I'm confused still on the

667
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:53,147
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's."

668
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,913
So, Wayne,
it's like, uh,

669
00:24:55,947 --> 00:24:58,447
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"?

670
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,447
See, it's not as if it's a
fuckin' question, Dary, is it?

671
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,080
You're saying it
like it's a question.

672
00:25:02,113 --> 00:25:06,447
So, it's like,
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."

673
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,980
You're gettin closer, Dary,
but what you want to do

674
00:25:08,013 --> 00:25:09,080
is put a little pepper
on the end of it.

675
00:25:09,113 --> 00:25:10,413
You just want to put a little
pepper on the end of it.

676
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:12,013
Like, "Yes!"

00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:14,547
"Yes!"

‐"Ah, fuck."
