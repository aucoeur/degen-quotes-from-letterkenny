1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,700
You're having
some beers in the barn

2
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:13,600
with your pals
the other day...

3
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:15,166
So, have you figured out
what you're gonna do

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,366
as first act of Ag Hall
President there, super shoots?

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,133
You're looking at it,
pea shoots.

6
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,033
No, he's talking about
a charitable act, big shooter.

7
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:22,633
We'll advise you there,
shoots and ladders.

8
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:23,666
We'll be your team,

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,100
‐half court shooter.
‐K.

10
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:26,500
Like when Obamas
became president,

11
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:27,633
he started
bringing troops home.

12
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,100
Oh, is that what he did?

13
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:30,266
Or when Trudeau
became Prime Minister,

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,800
he started bringing
refugees over.

15
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,400
Oh, did he do that?

16
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,233
Whatever you do, just make
sure peoples know about it.

17
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:36,633
Yeah, like you're gonna want
to have somebody

18
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,500
come down from the paper,
take a photo of it.

19
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:41,200
‐Tweet a tweet, snap a chat.
‐Why?

20
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:42,566
Well, if it's not
in the papers

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,366
or on the Internets,
it's pretty much worthless.

22
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,633
DARYL: You know what I think,
we should almost be

23
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,200
snapping a chat
about us talking about doing

24
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:48,733
‐the charitables right now.
‐Pump the brakes.

25
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:50,200
Now, am I doing
the charitables

26
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:52,500
for the charity's gain
or my own?

27
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:54,566
Well, you do the charitables
for the charity,

28
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,100
but the whole point
of doing the charitables

29
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:57,333
is that people think
you're a good guy

30
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:58,533
for being charitable.

31
00:00:58,566 --> 00:00:59,633
Yeah, behaving charitably,

32
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,333
you'll have
people saying, like,

33
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:03,233
‐"Oh, he's a good guy."
‐"Oh, he's a real good guy."

34
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:04,766
‐"Oh, he's a great guy."
‐No!

35
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,300
I think you have had
too much sugar cereal.

36
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,100
The whole point
of doing the charitables

37
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,366
is to help the charity
and to make you feel good,

38
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,466
not look good. Figure it out.

39
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,366
Yeah, but it feels good
to have people call you

40
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,133
a real good guy.
You figure it out.

41
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,533
Oh, it feels even gooder
when someone says

42
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:19,733
you're a great guy.
You figure it out.

43
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:21,200
You want to do a charitable?

44
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:22,666
Drive into town
first thing in the morning,

45
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,533
dead of winter,
after a fresh snow fall.

46
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:26,233
Shovel a handful
of folks' driveways

47
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:27,433
before they wake up.

48
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:29,300
No one does a tweet.
Feels fuckin' sweet.

49
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,800
Also, it's a substantial
core workout,

50
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,133
from what I've been told.

51
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,366
Or if you're done
doing hay for the day,

52
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,766
drive on over
to someone's place

53
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,466
that isn't done
doing hay for the day,

54
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,766
cut their grass
or something like that.

55
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,766
No one snaps a chat.
Go fuck your hat.

56
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,366
Or couldn't you
just help them do hay?

57
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,566
‐But gets a photo.
‐You're gonna need a photo.

58
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,066
You wanna know what?

59
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,500
No one likes
a preachy Patrick,

60
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,333
but you are pissing
on the seat here.

61
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:51,366
Well, no one likes
an impracticals Pete.

62
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,700
No one likes
an unprepared Paul.

63
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,100
Or if you're a woman,

64
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:55,700
no one likes
an unproductive Pams.

65
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:56,800
Or an improper Pippa.

66
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,466
No one likes
a pestering Preston.

67
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,166
Or if you're a woman, no one
likes a patronizing Peggy.

68
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,366
Trust me, good buddies,

69
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,200
any charitables act,
big or small,

70
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:07,400
is an act wasted if your face
ain't attached to it.

71
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:10,233
‐Any charitable act?
‐Any charitables act.

72
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,766
Well, then come on, Dan.
Let's drive into town.

73
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,766
We'll let the dog
drop a shit on Main Street

74
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,466
and snap a chat
of you picking it up.

75
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,566
Good?

76
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,333
Pitter‐patter!

77
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:24,033
Choice work, super chief.

78
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,500
Oh, there's your lipstick.

79
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:29,533
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

80
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,166
Hey, 19! Nice stats, no stats.

81
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,166
Scored 40 genos in the dub,
one‐nine.

82
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,700
Sixty apples in the O, 19.

83
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:46,500
Lead the Q in PIMS
as an over‐ager, buddy.

84
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,100
Wheeled my buddy's
billet sister.

85
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:49,466
Fucking 200 PIMS, boys.

86
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,633
PIMS 200 club, boys.

87
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,200
All the light bulbs don't work
on the scoreboard, eh, bud?

88
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:54,633
A quiet night
in the red light district,

89
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,466
‐one‐nine.
‐Suck my knob.

90
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,766
Drink milk, one‐nine.

91
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,333
What'd they get
in a trade for you,

92
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:00,500
tin of chew
and a half a bag of pucks?

93
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:01,700
Set of used practice jerseys?

94
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:03,066
Tub of orange slices?

95
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,633
Go carbo‐load, 19.

96
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,166
Suck my knob, you plug.

97
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,233
Hey, Schmelts.

98
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,733
You do not get
to talk to Mr. Sakic.

99
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:10,366
Mr. Sakic
has earned our respect.

100
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,100
You have not earned
our respect, Schmelts.

101
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,233
You do not get
to talk to Mr. Sakic.

102
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:15,566
YORKIE: Your first period
in the league, Schmelts.

103
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,100
You'll be sent down
by the second.

104
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:18,366
This is fantasy camp for you.

105
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,633
COACH: Hey!

106
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,400
You think you can just
walk into this league

107
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:22,500
and start chirping?

108
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:24,233
Know your role, pheasants!

109
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:25,600
You had a cup of coffee.

110
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:27,300
You're seat fillers
at the ESPY's.

111
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,766
You're Tiger's caddy
now that nobody gives a shit!

112
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,766
It's fucking embarrassing!

113
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,766
I don't miss playing
for that guy, buddy.

114
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,500
Always a silver lining, buddy.

115
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,433
SHORESY: Give your balls
a tug, you tit fucker!

116
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,466
The fuck did Shoresy
come from?

117
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,233
I didn't even know
he was here, bro.

118
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,666
Hey. All this time chirping

119
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,433
could be better spent
doing legs, Schmelts.

120
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:49,533
Never skip leg day, Schmelts.

121
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:50,800
Hey, nice work
on legs day today.

122
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,333
Hey, you rocked
legs today, Yorkie.

123
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,100
Thanks. Barts, you're faster

124
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,533
than the Russian Rocket,
Pavs Bure.

125
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:57,433
That is where leg day got you!

126
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:59,333
Yorkie, statistically,
Mike Gartner was faster

127
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:01,033
than Bure, and that's where
leg day got you.

128
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,466
‐Let's win it all, Barts.
‐Let's win this ship, Yorkie.

129
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,700
(BOTH GRUNT)

130
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,033
So, from now on,

131
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,400
you're supposed
to call the police

132
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,733
when you got worm pickers
on the property, and not 911.

133
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:17,100
Good?

134
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,166
Now that's the business.

135
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,400
Except for that,
anything pressing?

136
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,100
‐And she's back to choring.
‐One moment!

137
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,233
Or should I say motion.

138
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,633
McMurray, how are ya now?

139
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,633
‐Good n' you?
‐Not so bad.

140
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,100
Good.

141
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,100
‐I will speak candidly here.
‐Go ahead, baby.

142
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,666
Everybody's listening.
Everybody loves you.

143
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,233
All right. The goings on

144
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,666
from last week's
emergency meeting

145
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,700
left me some terrible upset.
Some terrible upset.

146
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:43,433
Oh, yeah, the ass pisses
all goddamn week,

147
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,233
‐that's all I know.
‐This is true.

148
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,566
I have had the ass pisses,

149
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,200
also known as p'zazz.

150
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:51,400
He's been making the weakest
cocksucking gin and tonics

151
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:53,500
I ever goddamn had.

152
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:56,300
All of these events combined

153
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,766
have brought me
to one conclusion.

154
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,766
I, McMurray, motion
something must be done.

155
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,200
Something has to be done.

156
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:05,400
A proper election
must take place,

157
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:08,233
whereby both Wayne and I
campaign for a week

158
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:13,033

Big Riggins himself.

476
00:17:28,112 --> 00:17:28,879
You picked Big Riggins,

477
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:30,212
so I'll take Michael
Fassbender, bro.

478
00:17:30,246 --> 00:17:31,312
Yeah. But if...

479
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:33,146
If Big Riggins,
if he's not available,

480
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:34,812
'cause he's my number one,

481
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,212
it's easy,
Chad Michael Murray, boys.

482
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:38,146
Big Riggins
is still my number one

483
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:39,946
but I love Chaz Michael, bro.

‐Try channeling that.
‐Choose Big Riggins.

DAN: You know what?

488
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:49,179
Actors named Michael could
really reinvent themselves

489
00:17:49,212 --> 00:17:51,712
if they change their names
to Spike, like uh,

490
00:17:51,746 --> 00:17:55,246
Spike Fassbenders
or, uh, Spike Caine

491

or Spike J. Fox.

492
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,246
‐Spike Buble.
‐Chaz Spike Murray?

493

Oh, C. Spike Murray?

Well, now it might
be kind of awkward,

496
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:06,712
might be kind of awkward
if actors named Richards

497
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:08,112
started going by Dick.

498
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:10,779
Right? Like Dick Gere.
Dick Pryor.

499

‐Dick Dreyfuss...
‐Lionel Dick.

500
00:18:13,112 --> 00:18:15,579
Feel like Richard Simmons
probably prefers Dick.

really threw me off.

Thanks for cutting
my lawn, though.
