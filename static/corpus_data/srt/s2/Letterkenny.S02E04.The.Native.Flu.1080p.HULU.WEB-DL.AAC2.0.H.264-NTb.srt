with your pals the other day.

2
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:16,333
Sundays are for
pickin' stones.

3
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:19,366
KATY: Tale as old as time.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,700
Would you rather pick stones
or pick worms?

5
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,333
Well, pickin' worms is done
at night

6
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:24,700
and it can gets rather brisk.

7
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,666
So I'd say pickin' stones

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,400
'cause it's in the sunshines.

9
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:30,100
There's been an incident
and I'd like to talk about it.

Get after it.

Well, Pitter‐Patter,
let's get at 'er.

Spit it out, big shoots.

I seen Stewart's horn.

14

What?

15

‐You seen his impaler?
‐His bobby dangler?

16
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:47,433
‐Well...
‐You seen his PhD?

17

‐His WMD?
‐Now, look, fellas...

18
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:51,433
‐You seen his friendly weapon?
‐His sticky grenade?

19
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:52,566
His ground squirrel?

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,566
Yeah, I seen
his ground squirrel.

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,200
You seen
Stewart's middle stump?

22

You've seen
his custard slinger?

23
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,200
Well, I'm comin' up the stairs

24
00:00:58,233 --> 00:00:59,200

out of the bathroom

25

for some fuckin' reason.

27

DAN: His hard drive.

29
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,033
Well, his floppy disk
is what I seen, yeah.

30
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:10,300
‐Well, what's the evaluation?
‐Yeah.

31
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,400
I'd hear an assessment.

32
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,633

Stewart isn't
a really big dude.

50
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,433
Are you sure the size
of his horn

51
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:47,600
wasn't accentuated
by his really tiny frame?

52
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,500
Looked like a one‐liter
thermos hangin' there.

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,566
Because... Because, you know,
a really big dude

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,100
can have a massive horn,
but it would look really small

55
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:00,066
in proportion
to his gigantic frame, right?

56

You wanna know what?

There's such a thing
as too much horn talk

to be fuckin' aware of it.

this weekend, boys.

164
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:49,333
‐You got the native flu?
‐We do not have the

165
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:50,666
native flu.

166
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,666
We do not have the native flu.

167
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,733
Don't be scared to admits it.

168
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:55,300
Those natives are tough
as hell.

169
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,766
Yeah, those natives
are tougher than hell.

170
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,433
Look, we can handle
the natives in the rink, boys.

171
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:02,666
We know we got business
in their barn, boys.

172
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,333
But Tanis and her troops
are gonna be waiting for us

173
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,100
in the parking lot, so we...

174
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11,166
‐We need back up, boys.
‐Hard no.

175
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,233
Aw, come on.
Where's your jam, bud?

176
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:14,800
Not my pig. Not my farm.

177
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,266
Where's the sacrifice?

178
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,366
Oh, get off the cross,
we need the wood.

179
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,033
We tuned 'em up on our turf
just a fortnights ago.

180
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:22,700
Yeah, we step back
on theirs now,

181
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,133
that's a suicide mission.

182
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,666
Mmm...

183
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,266
I heard Tanis wants the ban
on Letterkenny lifted, too.

184
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,466
Then she shouldn't
have burned down

185
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,666
the fuckin' produce stand.

186
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,200
Come on. Where's your
goddamn hustle, bud?

187
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,166
Let's see the hustle, boys.

188
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,633
When a man asks you for help,
you help him.

189
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:43,600
Pitter‐Patter.

190
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:46,200
Well, I guess I haven't been
in a scrap in a while.

191
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,133
We could go get bags
of darts, too.

192
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,666
And their venison pepperettes
are not to be missed.

193
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,100
I pert near popped
a street meat vendor

194
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:53,366
outside of a Jays' game
one time

195
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,766
for sellin' me a venison dog.

196
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Ain't no goat‐da‐goddamn way
that's venison dogs.

197
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,466
‐No.
‐Well...

198
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,200
I'd go for a scrap.

199
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,633
We'll need reinforcements.

200
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,200
‐Joint Boy?
‐Yeah, you could call JB.

201
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:06,666
‐What about...
‐No.

202
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,766
‐Oh, you mean the Ginger?
‐Hard no.

203
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,500
‐But?
‐Now, everybody listen up

204
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:12,733
'cause I'm only gonna
say this once,

205
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,600
we never talk about it again.
You understand?

206
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:19,300
We all lay off the Ginger
and Boots now.

207
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:23,366
Because the Ginger and Boots
did not fuck an ostrich.

208
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Yeah, I heard they fucked
two ostriches.

209
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:26,800
Allegedly.

210
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,400
Folks'll say that it takes
two people to fuck an ostrich.

211
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:31,033
Three even.

212
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:33,066
Folks are also saying
that it was a sick ostrich.

213
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,366
Allegedly.

214
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,333
WAYNE: Now, I went
on the Internet

215
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:37,066
and researched ostriches.

216
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,300
Firstly, ostriches can run up
to 70 miles an hour.

217
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,700
So catching one,

218
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:44,200
even a sick one,
is a super tall order.

219
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,333
Yeah, but there
was two of them.

220
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:47,666
Secondly, when
a male ostrich,

221
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,800
it's called a cock,

222
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,600
fights over
a female ostrich,

223
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:53,200
they're called a hen,

224
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:54,400
they're known
to kill each other

225
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,100
by head butting.

226
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:57,500
Probably should
wear hockey helmets.

227
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,166
Hockey helmets, buddy.

228
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,800
Well, they'd need
a race car helmet, likely.

229
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,600
Finally, ostriches use their
legs to defend from predators.

230
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:06,666
And can use them to kill even
their largest

231
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,633
and most deadly enemies,
which are fuckin' lions.

232
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,033
That's the king of the jungle.

233
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,466
Still just a cat.

234
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,766
So you'll see there is no way

235
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,400
the Ginger and Boots
could have fucked an ostrich.

236
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:19,200
Maybe they tranqed
the ostrich.

237
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,133
Like they roofie'd
the ostrich?

238
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,566
WAYNE: You wanna know what?

239
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,300
You should feel bad about
even suggesting

240
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,800
that the Ginger and Boots
fucked an ostrich.

241
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,666
Bad gas travels real fast
in a small town.

242
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,233
My research concludes

243
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:30,766
that the only way
the Ginger and Boots

244
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,500
could have fucked an ostrich
is if it was a dead ostrich.

245
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:38,200
Ginger and Boots (HORN HONKS)
a dead ostrich?

246
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:41,400
I thought it was just sick!
Oh, my! Ginny?

247
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,666
The Ginger and Boots
effed a dead ostrich.

248
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,133
Oh, bother.

249

ones are called!

00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,738
Trigonometry fucked me.

322
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:50,238
I forgot long division
in grade six.

323
00:11:50,271 --> 00:11:53,671
Okay. Lift the ban
on Letterkenny.

324
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:55,171
We'll make a buck
and yous can cruise the rez.

325
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:56,938
‐Bags of darts?
‐Yeah, go to the casino.

326
00:11:56,971 --> 00:11:58,138
Venison pepperettes?

327
00:11:58,171 --> 00:12:00,671
Yes. Go watch a fuckin'
hockey game.

328
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:02,638
WAYNE: Mmm...

329
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:05,871
Nope.

330
00:12:16,204 --> 00:12:17,804
FBIs coming.

331
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,771
‐Who's that?
‐Fuckin' Big Indians!

332
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:25,704
Now, one of yous farted right
before she got here

333
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:27,738
and she
definitely thought it was me.

334
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:28,838
‐Dan?
‐I'd admits it.

335
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:30,071
JB?

336
00:12:30,104 --> 00:12:32,004
Would've went out my window.

337
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:33,804
Maybe she farted.

338
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:35,771
(GIGGLES) It was me.

339
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:40,171
Hey, since when did algebra
become a quick wank?

340
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:41,904
I once popped
my grade nine math teacher

341
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:43,971
over the Pythagorean theorem.

342
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:46,038
‐Did you get expelled?
‐Just suspended.

343
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:48,338
Yep, called probability
and statistics.

344
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:50,004
Like probably never gonna
need them

345
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:51,204
statistics in your whole life.

346
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,738
That's kind of like fractions.

347
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,071
Like multiplying
and dividing them.

348
00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:55,671
Like who the fuck's
doin' that?

349
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:58,171
My friend David does tool
and dye and he uses fractions.

350
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:00,004
Should have
just got his fridge ticket.

351
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:01,404
David has his fridge ticket.

352
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:03,038
Then he should
just drive truck.

353
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:04,104
Well, it's never too late
to drive truck.

354
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,004
Oh!

355
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:10,038
Eyelash. Make a wish.

356
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:13,371
Wish you weren't
so fuckin' awkward, bud.

357
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:18,304
TANIS: Five minutes!

358
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:20,738
Yup.

359
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,371
‐You ready, bro?
‐Born ready, buddy.

360
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:27,704
You stretch it out, bro?

361
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:29,238
Good and limber, bro.

362
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:30,104
I say we get a couple
of shifts in

363
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:31,738
before we answer the bell.

364
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:33,238
Get a couple of shifts in
before tea time.

365
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,738
Get that first shot in
and just keep goin', buddy.

366
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:35,871
Don't hesitate, buddy.

367
00:13:35,904 --> 00:13:37,038
Take a shift, schmelts.

368
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,771
Ooh!

369
00:15:08,104 --> 00:15:09,871
Pulled salad in the scrum.

370
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:11,671
Got a mitt full, boys.

371
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:13,304
You get any good shots in?

372
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:15,038
Think I was on my feet
for a bit there, bro.

373
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:18,838
Hey, are you hurt
or are you injured?

374
00:15:18,871 --> 00:15:20,304
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

375
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:28,871
Ah! Don't...

376
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:36,738
100% pure organic,

377
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:38,938
grass‐fed,
Triple A Alberta beef.

378
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,104
Better believe
it's 'Berta beef.

379
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:41,771
What you got there?
Top sirloins?

380
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:43,004
Yeah, the New Yorks
are grain‐fed.

381
00:15:43,038 --> 00:15:44,938
Three times the omega‐3's
in grass‐fed.

382
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:46,371
Bought and paid for.

383
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,771
Well, you're gonna want 'em
aged if they're top sirloins.

384
00:15:48,804 --> 00:15:50,004
Pump the brakes.

385
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:51,338
Two things. One.

386
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:53,071
We'll let those sit for
10 to 15 minutes

387
00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:54,304
till they're room temperature.

388
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:55,838
Two. Where's the
salt and pepper, bud?

389
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,004
Don't you fuckin' start.

390
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:58,704
S and P, the choice for me.

391
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:00,204
I paid a C‐hair just
shy of 20

392
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:01,438
for each of these C‐suckers

393
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:03,671
and I will not be told
how to cook 'em.

394
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:04,938
You paid 20 apiece
for 'Berta beef?

395
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:06,704
‐Only 'Berta beef.
‐Well, no guff.

396
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:08,704
But I wouldn't pay 20
apiece for Japanese wagyu.

397
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:10,271
‐Always 'Berta beef.
‐Hard yes.

398
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,838
But I wouldn't pay 20
apiece for Australian wagyu.

399
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,738
Gonna want a rib eye
if it's a wagyu.

400
00:16:14,771 --> 00:16:15,904
One‐inch thick top sirloin.

401
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:17,338
Grill at 400.

402
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:19,004
Four minutes a side.
Down the hatch.

403
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:20,971
‐You are fuckin' up, bud.
‐That's textbook.

404
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:22,671
Not without the S and P.

405
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:24,438
Those fine ranchers
in Alberta'd be a C‐hair away

406
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:25,738
from not sendin' it here
if they knew you were

407
00:16:25,771 --> 00:16:27,671
sprinklin' salt all over
the C‐suckers.

408
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:28,738
You're a C‐hair away
from gettin'

409
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:30,104
C‐suckin' socked, good buddy.

410
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:31,271
Montreal steak spice really

411
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:32,738
should be a part
of this conversation.

412
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:34,271
One‐inch
thick top sirloin steak.

413
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:35,738
Salt and pepper heavily.

414
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:37,838
Grill at 400.
Four minutes total.

415
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,871
Flip each minute
to get the good grill marks.

416
00:16:39,904 --> 00:16:41,904
Let sit for two minutes.
Down the hatch.

417
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:43,438
‐Flip twice.
‐Grill marks, bud.

418
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:45,304
‐Sacrilege.
‐I will strike you.

419
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,971
‐Blasphemy.
‐Do you wanna get striked?

420
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:48,138
Finish the whole thing off

421
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:49,404
with a real nice herbs
and garlics butter.

422
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:51,704
Don't fuck up
my steak dinner, Dary!

423
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:53,104
Any decent chef will tell you,

424
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,738
you don't even want to let
those things touch the grill.

425
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:56,104
Make it dryer than a fart.

426
00:16:56,138 --> 00:16:57,371
What ya wanna do, pan sear it,

427
00:16:57,404 --> 00:16:58,704
both sides,
finish her off in the ovens.

428
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,371
Well, see, now that sounds
like over‐handling to me.

429
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:05,104
You'd be over‐handling them,
Squirrelly Dan.

430
00:17:05,138 --> 00:17:06,704
Well, he'd be
Squirrelly Dan'dling.

431
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:08,938
Oh, yeah, me and Gordon Ramsay
are both morons.

432
00:17:08,971 --> 00:17:11,371
You wanna know what?
Meet half way.

433
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:14,138
All right,
no S and P, flip twice.

434
00:17:14,171 --> 00:17:16,171
‐Good. Rare to medium rare.
‐Medium rare.

435
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:19,904
TANIS: Yo!

436
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,238
Ding, ding, pink dicks.

437
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,404
This one's mine.

438
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,204
Throw them steaks on, Dary,
this won't take long.

439
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:35,938
Oh!

440
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:39,904
(GROANS)

441
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:43,071
Remember me, boys?

442
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,304
Where's that 'Berta beef?

443
00:17:45,404 --> 00:17:46,338
Grill marks, bud.

444
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:52,004
That's the two‐fight rule
for the win, boys.

445
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,704
Two fights,
that's your night, buddy.

446
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:56,204
Hmm. Hey, did you get
any good shots in?

447
00:17:56,238 --> 00:17:58,071
No good ones, bro.

448
00:17:58,104 --> 00:17:58,971
He fish‐hooked me,

449
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:00,838
so I chomped his finger.

450
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,238
He gave me
a pretty good seatbelt,

451
00:18:02,271 --> 00:18:04,804
so I pinched the shit out
of the back of his arm, buddy.

452
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:06,038
I fuckin' hate
when that happens.

453
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:06,971
He did too, buddy.

454
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:09,771
Hey.

455
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:12,038
We would have dusted them
if they hadn't jumped us.

456
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:13,204
Proper dustin', ferda.

457
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:16,138
(GRUNTING)

458
00:18:18,371 --> 00:18:19,704
REILLY: Oh, shit!
Fuck, buddy.

459
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,671
We would have dusted them
if they didn't jump us.

460
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:29,371
Proper dustin', ferda.

461
00:18:36,371 --> 00:18:38,404
Hey, shirt‐tucker!

462
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:40,038
That doesn't really narrow
it down.

463
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,270
You. Meet me half way.

464
00:18:51,437 --> 00:18:53,437
I'll level with you.
We have a BFI on stand‐by

465
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,037
‐that will fuck you up.
‐K.

466
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,337
‐He'll lynch you.
‐Good.

467
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,037
‐He'll end you.
‐That's redundant.

468
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,570
You can end this
if you lift the ban.

469
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:01,970
You burned down
our produce stand, Tanis.

470
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:03,570
(CHUCKLES)

471
00:19:03,604 --> 00:19:05,137
Listen. I don't want
to call him.

472
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,304
‐You can call him.
‐Yeah, but I don't want to.

473
00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:07,437
Ah, give him a call.

474
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,937
I'd rather work this out
with you.

475
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,637
‐Too much talk.
‐Wait, wait, wait!

476
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,570
(SIGHS)

477
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:14,337
We're having a really
hard time on the rez, okay?

478
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,104
And selling cigarettes

479
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:17,670
in Letterkenny
really helps us out.

480
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:19,204
And all of the money goes
back into the community.

481
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,504
This dude
doesn't exist, does he?

482
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:26,570
I want you to meet someone.

483
00:19:28,137 --> 00:19:29,404
Dustin!

484
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:40,104
We don't have a lot of money.

485
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,137
And I'd sure like
to play baseball.

486
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,570
Please lift the ban, Wayne.

487
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:45,237
You can get a glove for free
at the Sally Anne.

488
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,537
Just have Mom or Dad drive
you down there.

489
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,337
(CLICKS TONGUE) Don't, uh...

490
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,604
Don't care much
for kids, so...

491
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:52,604
Bubba Wally!

492
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,470
The cupboards are bare
in the elders' lodge.

493
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:10,537
And we're so tired and sore.

494
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,937
Please lift the ban, Wayne.

495
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,237
I've got plenty of fresh
produce on the farm.

496
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,604
Yous are welcome to it.

497
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,637
Lego!

498
00:20:29,204 --> 00:20:30,604
Oh, fuck...

499
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:32,604
A three‐legged dog.

500
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:43,270
And look, Wayne,
another three‐legged dog.

501
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,404
It's cute, huh?

502
00:20:54,237 --> 00:20:55,470
Yous can come
back once per week.

503
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,104
Saturday mornings. Set up shop

504
00:20:57,137 --> 00:20:58,370
in the farmers'
market parking lot.

505
00:20:58,404 --> 00:20:59,504
We'll spread the word.

506
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:02,470
Nia‐wen.

507
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,604
Does this dude exist or not?

508
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:07,604
Mmm.

509
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,710
Pitter‐Patter!

510
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:20,171
(MUSIC PLAYING)

511
00:21:26,136 --> 00:21:27,703
Hey, Katy.
Carrying lunch there?

512
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:30,470
Yeah. You want a bite?

513
00:21:30,503 --> 00:21:32,603
Who's this?
He looks just like you.

514
00:21:32,636 --> 00:21:34,236
You actually
look great today,

515
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,436
you know, in comparison
to this bag of shit.

516
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,703
‐Thank you.
‐You're welcome.

517
00:21:37,736 --> 00:21:39,570
‐So?
‐So?

518
00:21:39,603 --> 00:21:40,670
Still an unapologetically
promiscuous tart?

519
00:21:40,703 --> 00:21:43,036
Yep. Still a heartbreakingly

520
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,636
inadequate
chronic masturbator?

521
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,403
‐No!
‐Hi, Roald.

522
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:50,070
‐Whatever!
‐Stewart,

523
00:21:50,103 --> 00:21:51,603
you and I were a bad idea.

524
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,603
(SCOFFS) Evident.

525
00:21:55,736 --> 00:21:56,636
But I still think you're cool.

526
00:21:59,136 --> 00:21:59,970
Adios.

527
00:22:06,436 --> 00:22:07,570
Hey, Devon.

528
00:22:08,803 --> 00:22:10,103
Ugh!

529
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:11,070
Want a bite?

530
00:22:21,336 --> 00:22:23,303
So what say that dude exists?

531
00:22:23,336 --> 00:22:25,170
He doesn't.

532
00:22:25,203 --> 00:22:26,636
Yeah, but what say
that he did?

533
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,270
What if he walks up and hoofs

534
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:29,570
you right in the nuts
like Joint Boy?

535
00:22:29,603 --> 00:22:31,436
JB's right, it's him or you.

536
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,370
But a kick
in the undercarriage?

537
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:35,503
Did Tanis ever recover
when I hoofed her?

538
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:36,670
I think she kind of did...

539
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:38,370
Just kiddin'.
I don't give a fuck.

540
00:22:38,403 --> 00:22:40,503
You still sweet on her,
though, Dary?

541
00:22:40,536 --> 00:22:43,003
‐No.
‐Why?

542
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:45,136
Bonnie McMurray, that's why.

543
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,103
You're sweet
on Bonnie McMurray?

544
00:22:47,136 --> 00:22:49,470
‐Oh, you bet I am.
‐Ha. Same.

545
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:51,303
Well, it's no
fuckin' mystery, Murdoch.

546
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,470
Better to be the dude doin'

547
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:54,070
the hoofin'
than the dude gettin' hoofed.

548
00:22:54,103 --> 00:22:55,470
Or the girl gettin' hoofed.

549
00:22:55,503 --> 00:22:57,236
Exhibit A. Tanis.

550
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,036
But a kicks in the cojones?

551
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,236
Well, it's too late once
you've been hoofed

552
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,336
in the nuts, isn't it?

553
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,470
You stand there holdin'
your ball sack

554
00:23:02,503 --> 00:23:04,170
wondering why
you didn't hoof first.

555
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:05,236
Or you stand there holdin'
your box

556
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,770
wondering why
you never hoofed first.

557
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:10,236
So what you're sayings
is if that dudes existed...

558
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,170
We've already established

559
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:13,770
the dude doesn't fuckin'
exist, have we not?

560
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:15,170
You'd kick him right
in the pills?

561
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:16,703
I'm fuckin' irritated.

562
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,103
Would you kick him right
in the pillbox?

563
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:21,403
I'm gonna go see
what's on television.

564
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:23,603
We're just speakin'
hypo‐ethically here, bud.

565
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,670
Ain't no reason
to get upset, Wayne!

566
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:53,824
TANIS: Save me an Indian taco.

567
00:24:00,824 --> 00:24:03,857
‐How're you now?
‐Does the dude exist or not?

568
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:06,591
No. Yous worked
through our finest.

569
00:24:06,624 --> 00:24:08,691
No one else measures up. Yet.

570
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,957
‐Stay for a barbecue?
‐No, thank you.

571
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:13,024
TANIS: Stay.

572
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,991
‐What are yous cookin'?
‐Wagyu.

573
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:23,124
‐Wagyu?
‐Wagyu New York.

574
00:24:23,157 --> 00:24:25,491
I was told you should go for
the rib‐eye if it's a wagyu.

575
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:27,157
‐Duh.
‐How you cookin 'em?

576
00:24:27,191 --> 00:24:28,624
One‐inch thick wagyu,
New Yorks.

577
00:24:28,657 --> 00:24:30,024
Heavily salt and peppered.

578
00:24:30,057 --> 00:24:32,024
Grill at 400.
Four minutes total.

579
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:36,591
Flip once a minute for those
good grill marks.

580
00:24:36,624 --> 00:24:40,591
Let sit for two minutes
and then down the hatch.

581
00:24:40,624 --> 00:24:41,524
Flip once a minute, eh?

582
00:24:45,557 --> 00:24:46,724
Grill marks, bud.

583
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:50,524
Grill marks, bud.

584
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,757
