00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:48,800
seen something like this
on a TV show one time.

161

of how this might work.

Anywho...

182
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,266
Your idea comes from
a good place, but

183
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,366
Uncle Eddie
always believed that

184
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,566
if a man needs help,
he'll ask. He won't be told.

185
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,633
And for that reason,

I'm out.

187
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:06,533
Sounds like touching tubes

188
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:09,200
was a pretty big setback
for Stewart,

189
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:11,033
but your pitch was
the real disaster.

190
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,133
I'm out.

191
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:14,733

So, are you just going to do
that every time, then, Bonnie?

200
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,551
Well, if you want
me to, Wayne.

201

Yes, please.

back to the community

by investing in
the youth, boys.

Really hustle
for the youth, boys.

216
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:14,918
Uncle Eddie loved kids.

217
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:16,651
His only shortcoming, really.

218
00:09:16,685 --> 00:09:18,651
We want to take the toughest
youth in Letterkenny

219
00:09:18,685 --> 00:09:20,551
and put them
into a house together,

with a gym and with a pool.

221
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:25,585
There, they'll work
out together

They will then fight each
other one by one

225

to find out who is,
in fact,

226
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:35,751
the toughest kid
in Letterkenny.

227
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:37,685
This concept
sounds a bit familiar.

No, it's a fresh
concept, ferda.

229

Ferda fresh.

230
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:43,018
Well, I'm trying to
wrap my head around this,

231
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:44,651
so I've got
a few questions, here.

232
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,985
So, you want to put a bunch
of dudes in a house together?

233
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:48,618
Yes. They'll be wearing
only gym shorts,

234
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:50,585
as you can see
in the poster.

235
00:09:50,618 --> 00:09:52,651
And then you'll have all these
dudes work out together?

236
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:54,685
Yes, and they'll
always be shirtless

237
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:56,718
‐'cause there's no AC.
‐It's hot.

238
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:58,985
Then when all these dudes
are done working out together,

239
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:00,751
they can go swimming together?

240
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:02,451
Oh, we'll teach them
how to wrestle, too.

241
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:04,451
Hold downs,
full mount, top control.

242
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:05,718
Throw some booze in the house.

243
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:06,351
They can have
a drink together.

244
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:13,018
What are you really trying
to accomplish here, boys?

245
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,518
KATY: Great presentation.

246
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,551
I really love
the bulletin board

247
00:10:15,585 --> 00:10:16,985
with all the sweaty dudes.

248
00:10:17,018 --> 00:10:18,518
You can just leave that here.

249
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,451
But I don't think that
Uncle Eddie would say,

250
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:22,985
"Katy, great investment
in sweaty dudes."

251
00:10:23,018 --> 00:10:24,285
And for that reason,

252
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:27,818
‐I'm out.
‐You want to know what?

253
00:10:27,851 --> 00:10:28,785
I'm just going to
come right out and say it,

254
00:10:28,818 --> 00:10:29,885
and you can take that
bulletin board with you,

255
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:31,551
please and thanks.

a tad fruity‐loops.

And for that reason,

I'm okay, Wayne.
Thanks, though.

Well, if you change your mind,

267
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:56,618
you can just run to the house
there, help yourself.

268
00:10:56,651 --> 00:10:57,851
Maybe I will run over then.

269

Can I get you anything?

270
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:00,018
Well, no, I'm okay.

Do you want anything
from the...

272
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:04,051
Hmm...

273
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:05,518
Wet your whistle.

274
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:06,818
No, I'm good.
I got some water.

275
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:08,918
Okay. No, we're okay.
Thank you, Bonnie.

276
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:10,018
Cool, Wayne.

277
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:15,951
Good afternoon, Wayne, Katy.

278
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:17,651
WAYNE: Gail, how are you now?

279
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:20,051
‐Good, and you?
‐Well, not so bad.

280
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:23,585

for 69% of my company.

281

Why 69?

282
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:25,985
Both sides benefit.

283
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:28,385
Good enough.

284
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:29,751
I want to give back
to the community

285

by helping people find love.

286
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:35,051
Uncle Eddie was
a notorious matchmaker.

287
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:36,651
And a real fucking legend
on the D floor

288
00:11:36,685 --> 00:11:38,385
‐right up till the bitter end.
‐Yeah.

289
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:39,718
GAIL: And I plan on doing that

290
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:41,518
by putting 20 women
from Letterkenny

291
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:43,318
into a house with you,

292
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:46,318
and having 'em all compete
for your hand in marriage.

293
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:47,418
‐Who, me?
‐Yeah.

294
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:48,751
Well, get after it.

295
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:50,418
Isn't this already
a reality series?

296
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:51,818
If it is, no one watches it.

297
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:53,085
Well, I'd fucking watch it,
boy howdy.

298
00:11:53,118 --> 00:11:55,485
I'll have the girls
perform campy tasks

299
00:11:55,518 --> 00:11:57,818
and complete silly challenges
to prove their mettle.

300
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,551
Well, that sounds fun.

301
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,351
Unnecessary, but go on.

302
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:03,018
Then you'd go on
group dates with them

303
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:04,685
and one‐on‐one
dates with them.

304
00:12:04,718 --> 00:12:06,918
And then you ax them
one by one

305
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:10,485
until you decide which one
you want to marry.

306
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:11,685
‐Okay.
‐I'm not sure

307
00:12:11,718 --> 00:12:13,051
it's reasonable that
he could choose

308
00:12:13,085 --> 00:12:14,418
a wife based just on that.

309
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:15,551
I know.

310
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:18,651
Tastes good, but where's
the cream filling?

311
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:19,751
Like a Boston cream?

312
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:21,351
Canadian maple's better.

313
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:22,451
Well, that's
a Texas‐sized 10‐4.

314
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:23,785
Here's the kicker.

315
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:25,818
When it gets down to the final
three girls, deal is,

316
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:28,551
you get to go to their houses
and meet their families.

317
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:30,351
See? Now that's reasonable.

318
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:32,585
And then you get to spend
a night with each of them,

319
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,585
until you decide which one
you want to marry.

320
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:39,718
Is that... Does she...

321
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:41,018
‐With all three?
‐Does she mean...

322
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,685
After the...

323
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:43,985
WAYNE: Well, maybe it means
that I would have to...

324
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:45,518
I don't want to talk about it,
just ask her.

325
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:46,951
Okay, I'll ask her.
You want to know what?

326
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:48,018
I got some fucking
questions here.

327
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:49,751
Sha‐boink!

328
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:51,351
Now, when you say I spend
the night with three of them,

329
00:12:51,385 --> 00:12:53,485
is it implied I have sex
with all three of them?

330
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:55,551
‐Sure is.
‐So, I meet their families.

331
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:56,951
Then we go have sex.

332
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,385
I do that with three of them,
before deciding which one

333
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:00,618
‐I want to marry?
‐Yeah.

334
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:02,518
And do the girls know going
into the process

335
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:04,685
that I will be having sex
with them and two other girls

336
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,385
before deciding which
one I want to marry?

337
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,618
Yeah. Maybe more.

338
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:10,718
And do the girls' families,
who I've just met,

339
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:12,651
also know, going
into the process,

340
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:14,651
that I will be having sex
with their daughters,

341
00:13:14,685 --> 00:13:16,751
as well as two other girls
who are not their daughters,

342
00:13:16,785 --> 00:13:18,651
before deciding which one
I want to marry?

343
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:20,051
‐Yeah.
‐And the girls,

344
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:22,818
and their families, find this
process entirely rational,

345
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:24,518
despite how self‐harming,

346
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:26,485
health‐hazardous,
and humiliating

347
00:13:26,518 --> 00:13:28,618
‐it very likely will be?
‐Yeah.

348
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:30,551
And do you say 20 girls,
and their families

349
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:32,551
will happily sign up
for this process?

350
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:33,918
Over and over, I imagine.

351
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:35,551
Oh, Gail, I don't
want to date a girl like that,

352
00:13:35,585 --> 00:13:37,518
for fuck's sake.

353
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,385
Comes from a family
like that. Fuck...

354
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,851
Gail, could there
be a female version

355
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:43,485
where there's one girl
and 20 dudes?

356
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:44,618
‐Yeah.
‐I'm in.

357
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:45,951
No!

358
00:13:45,985 --> 00:13:46,818
Ew!

359
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:48,751
You're out.

360
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:50,018
And do you want to know what?

361
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:50,918
‐What?
‐I'm out.

362
00:13:51,418 --> 00:13:52,418
Okay.

363
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:57,714
BONNIE: Up next in the barn,

364
00:13:57,747 --> 00:13:59,747
this husband and wife pair
from RR2 Letterkenny

365
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:01,214
wants to go hunting
for buried treasure.

366
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:04,114
Bonnie!

367
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:06,947
Bonnie!

368
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:08,247
‐Did ya feed the dog?
‐Yes!

369
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,781
Oh, well, thank you.

370
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:11,014
Jim Dickins, how are you now?

371
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:13,114
‐Good, and you?
‐Oh, not so bad.

372
00:14:13,147 --> 00:14:14,481
‐McMurray, how are...
‐Wayne, how are...

373
00:14:14,514 --> 00:14:15,981
‐Well, good...
‐Well, I'm good and...

374
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:17,747
‐I'm not so...
‐Oh, not so... Uh...

375
00:14:17,781 --> 00:14:19,947
‐Not so bad...
‐Go ahead.

376
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:21,714
‐You, you were first so...
‐No, why don't you go ahead?

377
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:23,214
Oh, I didn't want
to be impolite.

378
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,914
Just start talking,
please, McMurray.

379
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,347
So you can go
ahead and start...

380
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:27,781
If you're going to go first,
then it would be your turn...

381
00:14:27,814 --> 00:14:29,381
Just pretend what I had
to say wasn't important.

382
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:30,781
You're here to pitch,
are you not?

383
00:14:30,814 --> 00:14:31,847
Are you sure you don't
want to say anything?

384
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:33,814
Jesus,
Pitter‐Patter, McMurray!

385
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:35,281
Good enough. Have at 'er.
Yip, yip, yip.

386
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:37,114
Now, we are asking

387
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:39,347
for five K for 5%
of our business.

388
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:40,747
KATY: Okay.

389
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:42,147
We want to give back
to the community

390
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,481
by helping
them cocksuckers get rich.

391
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:44,947
Uncle Eddie used to
buy lottery tickets

392
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:46,447
for the seniors at
the home every week.

393
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:47,981
MRS. MCMURRAY:
And we want to goddamn do that

394
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:50,881
by auctioning
off other people's shit.

395
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:52,047
Bingo.

396
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:54,281
Did you know

397
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:55,914
that there are
storage facilities

398
00:14:55,947 --> 00:14:57,747
surrounding Letterkenny

399
00:14:57,781 --> 00:15:00,314
that are filled with other
people's useless

400
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:02,314
piles of their shit, that they
have forgotten about?

401
00:15:02,347 --> 00:15:03,847
Abandoned it, baby.

402
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:05,781
‐They abandoned their shit...
‐Abandoned their shit.

403
00:15:05,814 --> 00:15:07,214
Now, whose knob
do I got to polish

404
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:09,481
to get a cocksucking gin
and tonic around here?

405
00:15:09,514 --> 00:15:11,881
All right. We have secured
the auctioneering right

406
00:15:11,914 --> 00:15:13,414
for these
such storage facilities

407
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,714
with the help of our friend,
Jimmy Dickskin.

408
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:17,247
‐Dickins.
‐That's exactly what I said.

409
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:19,814
So, what we want to do is we
want to take people down there

410
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:21,114
and have them rummage
through all the shit

411
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:22,381
and then buy some of the stuff

412
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:24,181
and probably,
more than likely,

413
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,114
most definitely, find hidden
treasures, gold and jewels.

414
00:15:26,147 --> 00:15:27,114
And I'd settle
for a Tom Collins,

415
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:28,781
if it'll get this rig rolling.

416
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:30,347
So, you want to sell
other people's shit

417
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:32,881
that they left in their
storage locker.

418
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:34,447
‐Abandoned.
‐Abandoned.

419
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:36,381
‐Things that they abandoned.
‐But it's a storage locker

420
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:38,014
and nobody's got any good
shit in there.

421
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:39,114
(CHUCKLES)

422
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:43,047
You would be surprised.

423
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:44,347
I'm never surprised.

424
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:46,814
Well, you will be once we show
you a demonstration

425
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:48,814
of one such storage locker
that we have brought down

426
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,747
from the tiny town
of Tiverton.

427
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:52,114
Baby, if you will.

428
00:15:52,147 --> 00:15:53,447
Shall I call you Vanna,
for a little role‐play?

429
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:54,881
(LAUGHING)

430
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:56,147
Uh‐huh, baby,
you know what I mean?

431
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:58,047
All right, and a one,
and a two,

432
00:15:58,081 --> 00:16:00,214
‐and a three, Jimmy Dickskin!
‐Got a beautiful set of DVDs.

433
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:01,781
‐To start the bidding...
‐DVDs galore, look at that...

434

‐(AUCTION CHANTING)
‐One, two, three, four, five.

435
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:05,714
That's $50 guaranteed
for sure for DVDs alone.

436
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:07,914
Then we got a VCR.
That's a vintage VCR.

437
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:11,214
Guaranteed $50 for that
sweet piece of machinery

438
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:13,381
right then and there.
Maybe 100, maybe 150.

439
00:16:13,414 --> 00:16:15,181
No big problem.
What else have we got, baby?

440
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:16,781
Fishing lures.
What man doesn't want 'em?

441
00:16:16,814 --> 00:16:18,447
What man doesn't need 'em?
What man doesn't throw

442
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:20,447
fishing lures all over
the goddamn place?

443
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:22,247
Hundreds by the thousands.
Five dollars a fishing lure

444
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,214
guaranteeing it
for fucking sure.

445
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:26,747
So, you got five,
probably times 100,

446
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:28,881
probably $5,000 right there,
sitting alone in that box.

447
00:16:28,914 --> 00:16:30,447
That microwave was probably
touched by Mahatma Gandhi.

448
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:32,147
Easy! Maybe even Jesus.

449
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:34,281
The proper thing,
I guarantee ya, is worth

450
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:36,114
$100,000, no problem.

451
00:16:36,147 --> 00:16:38,147
A bit generous on your
evaluations there, bud.

452
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:39,114
All right, 100,000
might be too much,

453
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:41,447
but maybe 50,000.
What have we got now, baby?

454
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:43,481
Looks like we got a handyman
storage locker, baby.

and buy all of that paint
and paint your apartment

and give you
$100 cash in your hands.

What else we got, baby?

466
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:08,147
And now we're talking
big money. We got the bits.

467

We got bits.

Bits coming out of the ass.

00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:12,347
Twist bits, drill bits,
fucking Brad bits.

All over the place.
Baby's putting them in...

Gonna have so many bits,
you can put 'em in your tits.

You can put in your mouth,
you can shake 'em all around,

do a little dance,
and all kinds of shit.

474
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:21,214
Bits all over the place.
You can have so many,

475
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:23,214
you can lick 'em, suck 'em,
kick 'em fucking right in...

476
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:24,281
Not for me, though,
but somebody else

477
00:17:24,314 --> 00:17:25,847
who's into that kind of shit.

478
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:28,347
Each one is guaranteed to be
at least $100.

479
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,181
No problem there, for sure.
$100 each bit!

480
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:33,347
‐No, they're not.
‐Sure God damn are!

481
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:34,947
No, they're not.

482
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:37,047
‐Jimmy Dickskin!
‐Dickins!

483
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:38,847
I know it's Dickins,
and I meant no offense.

484
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:40,747
I was just trying to get you
to stop the...

485
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,114
Well, the thing you're doing.

486
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:43,914
No one keeps shit
in their storage locker

487
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:45,347
that you can rich off of.

488
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:47,414
Only shit like Brad
point bits, really.

489
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:49,081
‐Yep, see.
‐Uncle Eddie would have wanted

490
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:51,247
me to take this idea and put
it in a storage locker,

491
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:52,881
then abandon it.

492
00:17:53,914 --> 00:17:55,314
I'm out!

493
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:57,114
You want to know what? Whoever
called it the Brad point bit

494
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:58,181
would have done
themselves a favor

495
00:17:58,214 --> 00:17:59,814
by calling it
the Brad Pitt bit.

496
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:00,881
But either way

497
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,347
I'm out.

498
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:04,914
That's marketing
genius right there, Wayne,

499
00:18:04,947 --> 00:18:06,114
but you snooze,
you lose, buggers.

500
00:18:06,147 --> 00:18:07,414
You're looking
at three millionaires

501
00:18:07,447 --> 00:18:08,914
walking away from
ya in the dust.

502
00:18:08,947 --> 00:18:10,681
Have a good day!
On the morrow!

503
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:13,747
BONNIE: Up next in the barn,

504
00:18:13,781 --> 00:18:15,181
this southern evangelist

505
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:16,114
turned Letterkenny
youth worker

506
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:18,314
brings the sound of music.

507
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,247
Bonnie, where'd you get
your dress?

508
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:22,147
I don't know.
It was a Christmas present.

509
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:23,247
Can you find out?

510
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:24,714
I think so.

511
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:26,181
‐It's so cute.
‐Thank you.

512
00:18:26,214 --> 00:18:27,347
You're welcome.

513
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:28,481
Do you like it, Wayne?

514
00:18:28,514 --> 00:18:30,114
Glen, how're you now?

515
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:31,814
‐Oh, good and you?
‐Not so bad.

516
00:18:31,847 --> 00:18:33,447
Well, I want your five K.

517
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:35,114
For what percent?

518
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,281
Uh, at 0%.
That's the Lord's percentage.

519
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:39,014
‐Oh, is that what it is?
‐Yes.

520
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:39,981
Now, what I would
like to do,

521
00:18:40,014 --> 00:18:41,747
is to give back
to the community

522
00:18:41,781 --> 00:18:43,447
by spreading the
word of Christ...

523
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:45,147
‐Okay
‐...through song!

524
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:47,414
‐Uncle Eddie was an atheist.
‐Well...

525
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:48,814
Then he couldn't have
been a Boy Scout

526
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:50,714
because atheism
violates our pledge.

527
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:52,447
‐You're a Boy Scout?
‐Uh, yeah.

528
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:53,881
Fastest Boy Scout
to ever earn his badges

529
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:55,881
in basketing and bugle‐ry.

530
00:18:55,914 --> 00:18:57,481
Hey, ya ever had
a Frozen Girl Scout?

531
00:18:57,514 --> 00:18:59,714
Yes! But with three scoops
of chocolate gelato

532
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:00,914
instead of ice cream.

533
00:19:00,947 --> 00:19:02,447
I'm proudly
lactose intolerant.

534
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:03,981
So am I, but you can
power through that

535
00:19:04,014 --> 00:19:05,147
if you really want to.

536
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:07,047
Wayne!

537
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:09,347
I'd like to introduce you

538
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,714
to Milo, Levi, and Finn.

539
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:14,381
Those sound like stage names.

540
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:17,714
Oh, they are. Their actual
names are Kennedy,

541
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:19,414
Cullen, Campbell.

542
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:21,781
‐Those sound like last names.
‐They are.

543
00:19:21,814 --> 00:19:24,781
Now I would like to take these
boys to Los Angeles

544
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:26,847
to audition for a little show
you might have heard of,

545
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:28,781
called America's Got Talent.

546
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:30,281
Now, I know what
you're thinking.

547
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:32,081
Why can't you just bring 'em
to the local model search

548
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:33,981
and talent show that's
coming to town soon?

549
00:19:34,014 --> 00:19:36,247
Well, I would prefer
to bring them directly

550
00:19:36,281 --> 00:19:38,214
to the epicenter
of everything.

551
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:39,714
Make 'em super‐famous

552
00:19:39,747 --> 00:19:41,081
and then inspire loads
of other boys,

553
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,947
all over Letterkenny, to sing.

554
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,481
‐What do ya sing?
‐Oh, we sing Enya.

555
00:19:44,514 --> 00:19:45,814
We sing Enya‐thing.

556
00:19:46,747 --> 00:19:48,281
It's a choir joke.

557
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:49,947
Anywho, I'm their choirmaster

558
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,781
but I consider myself
to be more of a...

559
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:53,914
A player‐coach
in the equationatto.

560
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:55,214
Because, I mean, frankly,

561
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:57,047
who wants a trio when
you can have a quartet?

562
00:19:57,081 --> 00:19:58,847
‐Tick‐tock.
‐Okay, boys.

563
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:01,047
Ragazzo!

564
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:02,381
Grazioso.

565
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:04,047
Espressivo.

566
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:05,381
Energetico.

567
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:06,947
Grandioso!

568
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:10,747

584
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:07,281
Well, there was supposed to be

585
00:21:08,314 --> 00:21:09,914
an intermezzo,

586
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:15,281
but Milo keeps
forcing his falsetto

587
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:18,081
and not accepting the
fact that he is a castrato.

588
00:21:18,114 --> 00:21:20,114
‐Okay...
‐And Levi

589
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:21,214
thinks this is madrigals,

590
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:24,214
and will not allow me
my obbligato.

591
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:26,347
‐Uh‐huh?
‐And then there's Finn.

592
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:29,247
This is not fucking Glee.

593
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:35,081
Now the soul of the piece is
obviously in my ostinato,

594
00:21:35,114 --> 00:21:36,981
in my "praise him."

595
00:21:37,014 --> 00:21:38,314
By the time we get
to Los Angeles

596
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:40,114
the piece will begin
with a sonatina,

597
00:21:40,147 --> 00:21:42,081
it will be accompanied
by a partita.

598
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:45,447
It will then accelerando
into a capriccio.

599
00:21:45,481 --> 00:21:48,347
I will play my third role
in the equationatto

600
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:50,914
as the contralto
of the quartet‐o.

601
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:54,214
So?

602
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:56,281
Some people prefer a trio.

603
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,981
I am one of those people.

‐And for that reason, I'm out.

‐It's next weekend!
‐Holy fuck.

607
00:22:04,347 --> 00:22:07,047
‐What?
‐Oh, fuck, bud.

608

‐What?
‐I'm out.

609
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:22,511
Up next, two barn

Hi, Dan.

‐How are you now?
‐Good, and you?

614
00:22:29,678 --> 00:22:31,478
‐Not so bad.
‐Taking a piss?

615
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:32,611
Just a fucking pisser, yeah.

616
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:33,811
Okay.

617
00:22:33,845 --> 00:22:35,078
I yacked from donkey juice.

618
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:36,911
‐Oh, did ya have a spit?
‐You meat‐sauced.

619
00:22:36,945 --> 00:22:38,678
I was up all night, pretty
near spitting everywhere.

620
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:40,078
That's pretty near the whole
point of donkey juice.

621
00:22:40,111 --> 00:22:41,545
Like, you know
you're gonna have to spit.

622
00:22:41,578 --> 00:22:43,245
‐Had to call Earl.
‐I called Huey, too.

Yeah, I solds the Buick.

624
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:45,578
Oh, did you all toss
a sidewalk pizza?

625
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:46,678
Yep.

626
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:48,245
‐Yep.
‐Yeah.

627
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:49,678
Well, that's pretty near
the point of donkey juice.

628
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:50,145
Like, you know
you'll have a spit.

629
00:22:50,945 --> 00:22:52,911
We are asking for five K

00:22:52,945 --> 00:22:55,578
‐for 50% of our business.
‐Fucking serious?

Oh, we sees
everyone else doing it,

632
00:22:56,845 --> 00:22:58,478
figured we'd toss
our hats in the ring.

633
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,545
You can borrow some money
if you want to.

634
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:02,645
No, we've got enough
to get by, thanks.

635
00:23:02,678 --> 00:23:04,011
Well, we wants to give back
to the community

636
00:23:04,045 --> 00:23:05,645
by getting jobs for peoples.

637
00:23:05,678 --> 00:23:07,545
Well, Uncle Eddie used
to always say...

638
00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:10,245
BOTH: "An idle mind is
the devil's playground."

639
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:12,578
‐10‐4, good buddy.
‐Over and out.

640
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:14,811
So Dary and me been
making these duck calls

641
00:23:14,845 --> 00:23:16,211
and we wants to
open up a factory

642
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:18,878
to manufacture
these duck calls.

643
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:21,845
Well, see now that
is a great, original idea.

644
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:23,811
And, uh, see Dan has a beard

645
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:26,511
and I'll grow a beard,
and then the only people

646
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:27,645
that we'd have
working in the factory,

647
00:23:27,678 --> 00:23:29,478
would also have beards.

648
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:32,078
And that would contribute to
our original and unique brand.

649
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,778
Unique and original.

650
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:35,978
Yeah. And when we're
not making duck calls

651
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:37,711
to contribute
to our unique brand,

652
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:39,645
we'd, uh, shoot guns

653
00:23:39,678 --> 00:23:41,878
‐and blows up beaver dams.
‐Oh.

654
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:43,211
Will the beavers
be out of the dams

655
00:23:43,245 --> 00:23:44,145
before you blow them up?

656
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:53,578
That's unclear.

657
00:23:53,611 --> 00:23:54,545
But a dam's got to get
blowed up.

658
00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:55,945
I'm surprised we're not
blowing up beaver dams

659
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:58,078
‐right now.
‐This is a choice idea, boys.

660
00:23:58,111 --> 00:24:01,578
And one that definitely no one
has ever attempted before.

661
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:03,578
‐I think I'm in.
‐What could go wrong?

662
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:05,878
And after we grows our brand

663
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,678
and got a followings,

664
00:24:07,711 --> 00:24:10,211
we could use our influences to

665
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:12,511
condemn homosexuals.

666
00:24:12,545 --> 00:24:13,145
Oh.

667
00:24:15,178 --> 00:24:17,245
No, no, 'cause...
It's okay because,

668
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:19,778
you know, once we've
created our brand,

669
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:21,211
and then condemned
the homosexuals,

670
00:24:21,245 --> 00:24:23,078
we'll just like go home
with our families

671
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:25,211
to eat supper and then
hold hands and pray.

672
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:26,778
Well, see now,
that's a wee bit

of a curve ball,
super‐chieftains.

674
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:29,711
What do you have
against homosexuals?

675
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:31,145
Me? Nothing.

676

‐Daryl?
‐Yeah.

678
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:35,745
‐Nothing.
‐So, why do you want

679
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:37,111
‐to condemn them?
‐Yeah?

680
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:44,111
We... We seens it
on a TV shows.

681
00:24:44,145 --> 00:24:45,511
‐We know.
‐We know.

682
00:24:45,545 --> 00:24:46,778
We actually seens it
on two TV shows.

683
00:24:46,811 --> 00:24:49,645
One was the TV show,
what we seens it on,

684
00:24:49,678 --> 00:24:52,178
and then the other
was a news program about

685
00:24:52,211 --> 00:24:53,811
what we seens on the TV shows.

686
00:24:53,845 --> 00:24:55,978
BOTH: We know.

687
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:58,011
But those guys
got real popular

688
00:24:58,045 --> 00:24:59,678
and they looked like they
was having lots of fun

689
00:24:59,711 --> 00:25:02,811
so we just figured if we
dids what they dids...

690
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:03,545
We could have
lots of fun, too.

691
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:07,811
Well, do you still want to
blow up beaver dams?

692
00:25:07,845 --> 00:25:09,611
Oh, can we still blows up
the beaver dams?

693
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:11,178
Oh, yeah, I kind of
thought this whole

694
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:12,545
conversation was about us
blowing up beaver dams.

695
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:13,245
I'm surprised
you're not blowing up

696
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,811
beaver dams right now.

697
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:17,545
This idea has lawsuit
written all over it.

698
00:25:17,578 --> 00:25:18,478
This is the worst
pitch we've seen.

Ever.

700

You can't even grow a beard.

guys doing now?

‐Yeah.
