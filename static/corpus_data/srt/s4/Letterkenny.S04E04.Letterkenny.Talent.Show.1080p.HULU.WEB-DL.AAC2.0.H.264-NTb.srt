Your pals found a package

2
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,300
that belonged
to a coupla Degens
the other day.

3
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:19,100
ALL: You're wrong, you're wrong
you're wrong.
WAYNE: Hey!

4
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:21,200
Where was it?
Dollar Store parking lot.

5
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:22,666
Tell him whose it was.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,100
Soupy Campbell's
and Spider Creemanse's.

7
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:25,533
KATY: Argh.

8
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:26,666
Well, did you open it?

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,800
Nope. Popped in right back
in the mailbox. Proper thing.

10
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,133
Shoulda opened it.

11
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,000
That just didn't feels right
on accounts that it wasn't ours.

12
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,633
Well, by the rules
of 'finders keepers,'
it was yours.

13
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:35,533
So you shoulda opened it.

14
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:37,233
Yeah, it was our guyses
by the rights.

15
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:38,633
I begs to differ.

16
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,000
Even though we founds it,
it was still technically
their guyses.

17
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:43,033
It was yours, fair and square.

18
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:44,333
With all dues respects,
Miss Katys,

19
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:47,266
it was them fellowses,
just landed in our guyses
hands brieflys.

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,100
Hmm, I'm with Katy.

21
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,566
It was our guyses.

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,300
And now we'll never know
what was in Soupy's
and Spider's package.

23
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,800
That's what I said.

24
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:55,966
Looks, I know what
you're thinking.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,633
You're thinking,
"You guyses
let yer consciences

26
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,633
"get in the way
of something that was
rightfully your guyses."

27
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,633
And you might be right.
She's right.

28
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,566
Their guyses loss
is our guyses gain.

29
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,133
There's something
not right here.

30
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,800
Not pertaining
to whose package
it was, but just...

31
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,233
like the English language
part of it

32
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:12,033
You guys keep saying,
"Your guyses,"

33
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:14,800
and "Our guyses,"
and "Them fellowhases."

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,633
Okay, just, 'kay,
you know what, 'kay,

35
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,833
what say Katy and I
find a wallet.

36
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:23,600
Whose wallet is it?

37
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,133
Yours and Katyses.
No.

38
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:28,666
Wayneses and Katy...ses.

39
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,600
It's ours.
Correct.

40
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,133
Or Katy's and mine.

41
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,300
You know what, it kinda chaps
my ass more than just a wee bit

42
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,300
when people use big words
to sound smart.

43
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,100
It's far more smart
and efficient

44
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:39,300
to use small words.

45
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,266
Save your breath
for something more important,

46
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,133
like chorin' or toe curlin'.

47
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,200
Hmm, especially toe curlin'.

48
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:47,700
You know, I thinks I know
what you'res insinuating
at here, Wayne.

49
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,133
And I want you to know
I take great solstice

50
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,800
in working through all
the conflictions that come

51
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,066
from the King and Queens

Or better yet, a whambleance?

54
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,933

of choice literature

55
00:01:57,966 --> 00:01:59,566
to help through
your confliction, Dan.

56

Well, the lie‐berry's is full
of choice laterature.

Ooh, now that one's so wrong,
it might as well be right.

60
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:10,266
In any event,

61
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,566
the decision on
what happens
to the package,

62
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,266
is Darylses,
and Danses,

63
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,233
not mine and Katyses.

64
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,000
But you did
the right thing, Dan.

65

Well, thank you.
I appreciate yer support.

00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:45,666
Stand up comedy?

159
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,766
Or something similar.

160
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,966
Well, to be fair...

161
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,133
(SINGING) To be fair...

162
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:54,733
(ALL SINGING) To be fair.

163
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:57,733
To be fair, it's likely
pretty tough sledding up there,
for a stand‐up comedian.

164
00:05:57,766 --> 00:05:59,133
That comedian was a joke.

165
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,033
(LAUGHING)

166
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:02,700
Well that's a good one,
big hos.

167
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,866
Thank yous.
Let me put it
this way, okay,

168
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,100
I was this close to making
that stand‐up comic

169
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,100
a lie‐down comic.

170
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:11,900
I don't get it.

171
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,200
Well, I'm just saying that

172
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:15,166
I was thinking about
whoopin' his ass

173
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,900
and so I imagined

174
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,733
he would have been
lying down had I done that.

175
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:20,233
Well, see there you go,
point and proof

176
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:22,200
you're up there trying
to be funny like a nut sack,

177
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:24,066
if nobody gets your shit,
you're hooped like him.

178
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,900
So...
So can confirm it's pretty
tough sleddin' up there

179
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:28,166
for a stand‐up comedian.

180
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,266
Ah, okay. I get it.

181
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,533
Could use a little work.

182
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:33,600
Point for test‐driving it
though.

183
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:35,033
In any event...
In any event...

184
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:37,966
In any event, we should
host our own talent show.

185
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:39,933
That's not a bad idea.

186
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,200
How're we gonna get
the word out?

187
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,600
Ah, you can put it
on your fuckin' Facebooks,
likely.

188
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:46,533
And whos will be preforming
at this events?

189
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:47,800
Who wouldn't,
that's the question.

190
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,266
The fuck else is there
to do around here.

191
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,133
Jimmy Dickens should host.
So we just need judges
and a few more acts.

192
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,766
Well, I'll judge
and so will he.
Why?

193
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,100
ALL: Born to judge, bud.

194
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:57,600
All right.
There's our judges.

195
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:58,800
Now we just need
a few more acts.

196
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,733
Would you be needing
a joke smith for this
esteems affair?

197
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:05,133
'Cause I've always
wanted to try my hand
at stands ups comedy.

198
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,200
And I've often wondered
how those courageous souls
makes it work.

199
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:10,200
Salt of the earth people,
stand up comedians.

200
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,933
For the most part.
You're in.

201
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,900
That leaves you, Daryl.

202
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:19,833
Got any special talent
you'd like to share
with the class?

203
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,666
Oh, I don't know.

204
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,300
I'd be half scared
to get up there.

205
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,966
That means you'd
be half excited too.

206
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,100
Well, we could make first prize

207
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:31,600
$100 bar tab at MoDean's
if that colors the water
any different for you.

208
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:32,633
He's in.

209
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,166
Good 'nuff.
Good 'nuff.

210
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,633
Good 'nuff.
Good 'nuff.

211
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,866
Good 'nuff.
Good 'nuff.

212
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Good stuff.

213
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:45,700
Wayne?
Dary?

214
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:46,800
What'd you get me into?

215
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,766
It's time to get back
on the horse, bud.
Oh, no.

216
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,966
No, I took that horse out
the back side of the barn.

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,800
Put her down for good.
And for good reason.

218
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,366
Are you forgettin' where you
come from?

219
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,533
'Cause it sounds to me
like you're forgettin'
where you come from.

220
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:58,800
Are you forgettin' your roots?

221
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,266
Your line‐dancing lineage
is legendary.

222
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,566
You will find
no finer liners, Dary.

223
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,966
Aunt Doreen made it
to sectionals.

224
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,233
I was not given that gift.

225
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:08,000
Aunt Doreen could
have gone to provincials.

226
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:09,333
Some say she could have
gone to regionals.

227
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:11,800
If she had lived
in the States, she would
have gone to state.

228
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,600
Oh, how she'd
have won state.

229
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:15,066
She'd a took state.

230
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,766
If it hadn't have been for...
She didn't have the...

231
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,166
If it weren't for the...
ALL: ...bum leg.

232
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,266
Buerger's disease.

233
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,166
Was it Buerger's?
Yes.

234
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,333
Buergers.

235
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:25,666
Didn't she get treated
at the Mayo Clinic?
Yes.

236
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,833
She got her Buerger's
treated with mayo.

237
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:29,800
Did she do that to ketchup
to the competition?

238
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,766
Did she ketchup?
Yes.

239
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,566
And despite her Buerger's,

240
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,066
she never beefed with anyone.

241
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,700
She relished a challenge.

242
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,633
That was a challenge
that she relished.

243
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,066
Mustard up the courage.

244
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,966
She worked her buns off.

245
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,966
She worked the buns
off her Buergers.

246
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,200
No cheesy moves.
Lettuce all be inspired by her.

247
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,600
She lettuce.
No hot‐dogging.

248
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:51,733
Just Beurgers.

249
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:52,800
The point is,

250
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,033
if Aunt Doreen can do
all that with a gouty gam,

251
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:57,100
you sure as shit
can line dance in Letterkenny.

252
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:58,700
I guess you're right.

253
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:00,933
If Aunt Doreen can do it
with a shitty stick,

254
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:03,800
then I can probably get up
on stage at the talent show

255
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,600
for Aunt Doreen.
The thing is, I just

256
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,133
wished I had
your guyses
confidence.

257
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:10,200
Or Fred Astaire's.

258
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,933
‐es.

259
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:15,566
Hey, guys,
I was over at Gailers.
How's Gailer?

260
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,700
You know, usual.
Upbeat and horny.

261
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,133
Who's your guys favorite
stand up comedians?

262
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,300
Mark Forward.

263
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,166
Dave Chappelle.
Steven Wright.

264
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,633
Why?
Who's yours?

265
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,100
Oh, big fella.
Hell of a storyteller.

266
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:30,900
Handsome as the day
is long. Can't remember
his name though.

267
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,133
Good guy?
Great guy.

268
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,700
I'm glad to hear
he's a good guy, at least.
Anywho...

269
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:37,266
I was wondering if I could
get your guyses opinions
on something.

270
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,733
Okay.
I've been working on
my stand up act.

271
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:42,000
My style's going to be
observationals comedy.

272
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:44,900
Pretty much I'm just going
to make observations about
days‐to‐day life.

273
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:46,600
You wants to hear one?
Sure.

274
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:47,933
All right.

275
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:50,033
Did yous ever notice

276
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:53,933
when you goes
to the gas station
and there's a line up

277
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:56,600
you always picks
which vehicles
to waits behind and,

278
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:58,700
and the other fellas whats
you didn't get behind

279
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,233
is always done first?

280
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,566
Always happens every time.

281
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:03,666
Kind of makes a fella wonder.

282
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,066
Don't it?

283
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,100
Yeah, that's
a choice observation,
Squirrely Dan.

284
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:11,833
Yeah, that happens sometimes.

285
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:12,833
All right. All right.

286
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:16,833
Let me try's another one.
Did you ever notice

287
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,933
you're at the grocery store
and you picks a cart what
with to do shopping with,

288
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:24,033
you always seem to grabs
the one that got
the squeaky wheel.

289
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:26,700
It almost happens
every single time,
every time.

290
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:27,933
Kind of makes a fella wonder...

291
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:31,300
don't it?
Yeah.

292
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,066
Yeah, I just needs to cook up
a few more of these,
and I'm in business.

293
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, yous never know.

294
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:39,866
You're letting gravity
win these days, boys.

295
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,733
No more man cans.
No more puddin' pecs.

296
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,933
No ifs, ands or guts.

297
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:44,833
So, let's gut going.

298
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,666
First things first,
you're gonna
reach your arm up

299
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,166
as high as it will go
touch that ceiling.

300
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,933
Higher than Ariana Grande
doing a Mariah Carey cover.

301
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:52,733
I told you, it's cardio day.

302
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:54,166
BOTH: Fuck cardio.

303
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Goddamn it.

304
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,966
Gotta crack a snappy
for the Winstagram, buddy.

305
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,866
Yeah, couple of pickies
for the chickies.

306
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,533
JONESY: Gymstagram, bro.

307
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:04,266
REILLY: Instapicks, instachicks.

308
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,166
Gotta provide people
with proof you're
pressin' pounds,

309
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,933
otherwise
what's the point?
Am I right?

310

311
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,533
Welcome Letterkenny,

What's the matter
over there Glen?

Last winter, Gail got me Lasik,
but it didn't take, so...

I didn't say it was your fault.

I didn't ask you
for your life story, Glens.

a few thoughts on Dan's act.
I thought it was good, good,
good, so good, we're looking

Well, it was observational,
as billed.

487
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,933
Funny, 'cause it's true,
I guess.

Overall, not s'bad.

Thank you, Miss. Katys.
I appreciates your assessment.

Well...

492

Well, I liked it because

493
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:48,833
what I see, I understand.

494
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:50,533
Whereas everything else
I've seen today

495

I don't understand.

496

I don't know
what that means,
it's probably not this,
