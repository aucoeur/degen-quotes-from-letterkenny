1
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,247
You're discussing
critical space stuff

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,316
with your pals the other day.

3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,318
DARYL: How would you
batch in space?

4
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:18,954
With immaculate care.

5
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:21,222
Yeah, it'd go airborne
if you didn't contain it.

6
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:22,858
Depends on the length
of the missions, I thinks.

7
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:25,326
Like, if it's
a pretty short mission,
you can probably gets away

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,595
without mixing
a batch up theres.

9
00:00:26,628 --> 00:00:28,830
Maybe you can get away
without mixing a batch.

10
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:30,666
I mix one every night
or I'm not sleeping.

11
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,433
Kind of likes how I needs
to takes a shower

12
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:34,302
immediately afters
I takes a shits?

13
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:38,473
You'd cone it.

14
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:40,241
What?

15
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:42,210
Each spaceman's
given a cone,

16
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,913
put over your junk,
for when you batch in space.

17
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:47,716
They do?
So let's say you're in
your space quarters,

18
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:50,285
you lay on your back
in your bunk,

19
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:53,722
put the cone over your junk
and fire one up,

20
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:56,257
and since
it's zero gravity,

21
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,594
your batch'd float up
to the top of the cone,

22
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:00,495
and remain there.

23
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:01,563
Then what'll you do with it?

24
00:01:01,597 --> 00:01:03,965
Each cadet's got a space
disposal in their quarters,

25
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:05,534
so he'll just
throw it in there.

26
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:07,435
That what they do?
Most important thing

27
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:09,705
is to obstruct the space cam
in your quarters

28
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:13,374
so that the rest
of the space cadets
don't see you batching.

29
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:15,343
I'd imagine they'd give
you a few cones.

30
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:17,813
Probably stick one of
those cones over the camera.
Exactly.

31
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:20,682
Wayne?

32
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:22,350
Dan.

33
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:25,854
How did youse acquires
this knowledge?

34
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:27,689
You remember when I took
Angie down Disney?

35
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:28,624
Yeah.

36
00:01:28,657 --> 00:01:30,726
Was having drinks in a bar
by Cape Canaveral

37
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,393
and heard
some cadets talking.

38
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:33,629
Space cadets?

39
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:35,296
Don't fuckin'
piss me off, Dary.

40
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,365
Isn't Cape Canaverals
a ways away from Disney?

41
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:38,466
It's not that far.

42
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,569
Okay.

43
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:42,370
You're having a drinks
in Capes Canaverals

44
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:43,705
and you overhear
some cadets

45
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,807
talk something about
mixing a batch
ups in space?

46
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:47,743
Did I stutter?

47
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,378
Crazier things
have happened,
I guess.

48
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,947
Was Bondars there?
Roberta?

49
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,482
Yeah, Robertas Bondars,

50
00:01:54,516 --> 00:01:58,520
neuroscientist, Canada's
first female astronauts.

51
00:01:58,554 --> 00:02:00,522
Fucking legend,
Robertas Bondars.

52
00:02:00,556 --> 00:02:01,990
Yeah, Bondar was there.
Nice.

53
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:04,526
What about the other guy,
um, what's his name?

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,794
He just left,
apparently.

55
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:06,962
Wow, rubbing shoulders

56
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:08,630
with North America's
finest space cadets.

57
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:09,998
Yeah.
Bondar hammered?

58
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:11,533
No.

59
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:14,770
No, I seen her crash
a few Old Fashioneds,

60
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:17,539
but she was actually
sitting in a quiet corner
by herself.

61
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:19,608
Wonder why
the other guys left.

62
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:22,010
I don't have
that information, Dan.

63
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:24,345
Can you imagine
if North America's
finest space cadets

64
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:25,714
went ups into
outer space togethers?

65
00:02:25,747 --> 00:02:26,915
Oh, they did.
They dids?

66
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:30,051
Yup. Houston wanted them
to go up there
together again, too.

67
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,621
Bondar didn't wanna.

68
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:33,722
Why nots?

69
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:35,591
I don't think
you wanna know.

70
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:36,892
Well, sures,
we dos.

71
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:45,867
Look, youse didn't
hear this from me,
all right?

72
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:46,968
All right.

73
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:48,504
Dary, all right?
All right.

74
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:50,005
Look, a lot of people
don't know this,

75
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:52,708
but those two weren't
just North America's
finest spacemen,

76
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:56,344
they were
actually planet Earth's
finest space people.

77
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,513
So, of course,
Houston wanted them

78
00:02:57,546 --> 00:02:58,714
up there together
as much as possible.

79
00:02:58,747 --> 00:03:00,816
But they only went
up theres togethers
the one time?

80
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,150
Yep.

81
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,853
'Cause Bondars didn't
wants to go up theres
with him agains.

82
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:06,688
Yeah.
Okay.

83
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:10,391
So, like, he was as
a bit of a guy's guy
around Kennedy Center.

84
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:11,927
You know, he played
pranks and stuff,

85
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,062
and they'd just say,
"Well, that's just him."

86
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:16,798
Of course, Bondar was
the more senior spaceman,

87
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:19,601
had a bit of a reputation for,
like, kicking it old‐school.

88
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:21,069
Hence, the Old Fashioneds.

89
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:23,772
So she didn't have a lot
of time for the whole
boys‐will‐be‐boys mentality.

90
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:24,840
'Kay.

91
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:27,108
So, they finally shoe‐horned
them up there together,

92
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:30,011
knowin' full well
it was oil and water.

93
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:33,148
And I guess you can say
he proved them right.

94
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:35,917
Those space cadets really
tell tales out of school, eh?

95
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:37,786
Yep.
What happened next?

96
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,723
So, each spaceman's
got a space cam

97
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:43,158
in their quarters
which are connected

98
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:44,926
to the other
spacemen's quarters,

99
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,596
as well as the main shuttle bay
and the saucer section,

100
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,131
the two smaller bays
and the stardrive section.

101
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:51,700
They'd be connected
to the main bridge?

102
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,068
Of course, they are,
Dary. Fuck's sake.

103
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:54,736
So, we're talking about
an elite vessel here?

104
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,739
NASA'd never send
a ship up there
if it wasn't galaxy class.

105
00:03:57,773 --> 00:04:00,642
You bet they wouldn't.
Same with Elon Musk,

106
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:02,844
but apparently Russia
does it all the time.

107
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:04,513
Fucking joke star fleet.

108
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:05,914
So, what happened next?

109
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:08,183
So, Bondar'd be up
in Alpha quadrant,

110
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:11,086
keeping the Captain's
log, likely, of the events.
Yeah.

111
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,755
And they'd all just come out
of a Yeager loop,

112
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:15,056
so she was a bit worn out.

113
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,157
Yeah, she wouldn't be
at full bars.

114
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:19,160
But, of course, there's Bondar
still up there in Alpha,

115
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:21,763
keeping an eye out
for wormholes and what not.
Yeah.

116
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:23,899
I guess there he'd be
down there in Beta quadrant,

117
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:25,701
floating around
in space quarters,

118
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:27,636
which Bondar could see,
so could Houston.

119
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,605
I guess what he'd do

120
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,073
is float off‐camera,

121
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:33,809
pull his space pants down,

122
00:04:33,842 --> 00:04:35,877
grab his junk in a bunch
in his hands...

123
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:36,945
Like dinker‐ball?

124
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:38,514
Sake, Dary.

125
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:39,815
This is hard enough
to get through

126
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:41,449
without you stopping
all over his story,
Dary.

127
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,018
Sorry, good buddy.

128
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:45,521
So, there he'd be
floating off camera.

129
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:47,055
I guess what he'd do...
Allegedlys.

130
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:49,490
...according to the cadets,

131
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:52,060
is dip just his junk
back into frame.

132
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:53,995
No.
Apparently did it
all the time.

133
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:55,163
Where's Houston
in all this?

134
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:56,532
Houston thought
it was hilarious.

135
00:04:56,565 --> 00:04:57,999
But Bondar didn't?
Nope.

136
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:00,936
Bondar did not.

137
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:02,003
Jesus Christ.

138
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:04,740
I guess then what he'd do
is he'd get on his comms.

139
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:05,641
Allegedlys.

140
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:08,076
Just telling you
what the cadets
told me.

141
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:09,945
He'd go like,

142
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,181
(IMITATES RADIO STATIC)
"Hey, Bondar,

143
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:16,785
"check out
space cam six."
No.

144
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:18,186
Yep.
She report him?

145
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:19,655
Oh, she reported it.

146
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:20,889
Did they slap
sanctions on him?

147
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:21,990
Yeah.

148
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:23,091
Yeah, he got jacked up.

149
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,726
Good for Houstons.
Mmm‐hmm.

150
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:27,896
Of course, they were still
supposed to be up there

151
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:29,765
another two months together,

152
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:31,700
and things only got worse.
How?

153
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:33,669
Remember what I was
saying about the cone?
Yeah?

154
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:37,105
I guess whenever
it was Bondar's turn
to clean Beta quadrant,

155
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:41,209
he would routinely batch
and not cone it.

156
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:42,277
Inexcusables!

157
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,746
I ain't Bondar to tell you
that's an understatement.

158
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,681
I think she would, too.

159
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:47,849
No, she never expected
to be floating around

I was gonna ask,

172
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,706
but then the cadets would know
I was eavesdropping, so...

173

do here, Bondar?"
