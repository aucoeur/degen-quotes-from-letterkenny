1
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,512
You're havin'... Dary?

2
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,613
Breh‐fekst.
Atta boy.

3
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:14,781
...with your pals
the other day.

4
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,352
You wearin' perfume, bud?

5
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:20,754
Perfumes is for womens,
good buddy.

6
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,089
He's wearin's the cologne.

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,191
It's actually
an eau de toilette.

8
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,728
Eau de toilet.
Eau de dew‐dah‐day.

9
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,730
What's the difference?

10
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,699
Well, a cologne is about
seven's percent's
aromatic essence

11
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:33,834
that dissolves in alcohols.

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,538
Whereas an eau de toilette
is 10% aromatics essences.

13
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,272
There you go.
An eau de toilette like this

14
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:41,107
will evaporate from
your skin pretty rapidly.

15
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,142
So, you're gonna wanna
load up on it.

16
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,679
You could still take a good
23 to 27% off'er, bud.

17
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,548
You never wears too much
perfumes, Miss Katy's.

18
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,215
And that's
what I appreciate's
about you's.

19
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,451
Let's not.
DARYL:
This eau de toilette is

20
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:54,555
enchantingly refreshing
on summer days like this.

21
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:57,157
That may the softest thing
you've ever said, Dary.

22
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,626
No, it isn't.
What is?

23
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,763
"I can't stand harsh metals
against my skin."

24
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,598
They give me a rash.

25
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,701
Oh, I love's pancakes.

26
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,203
ALL: Thank you, ladies.

27
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,538
These are actually crepes.

28
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,339
Pancakes with a French spin.

29
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,274
What's the difference?

30
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,510
Pancake batter has
a rising agent in it.

31
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:17,711
Baking powder.
There you go.

32
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,179
It makes them
thick and fluffy.

33
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,549
Crepe batter doesn't have
a rising agent in it,
so they're thinner.

34
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,084
Ch‐ch.

35
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,853
All's I know is that these
would be great with some
Elmira's maple syrup.

36
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,855
You's two's could open up
a crepe shop with these.

37
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,290
Wanna know what?
I already told her that.

00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,548

there's folks in France who
think you's guys butcher
your language. So...

why would I take
their threat seriously?

Oh...

161
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,865
(SMACKS)
STEWART: Ow! Again!

162
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,939
Dream notch on
the bedpost, boys.
Go.

163
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,440
Dead or alive?
Either.

164
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,642
Go.
Terry Fox.

165
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:49,976
Good one.
Great one.

166
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,745
Do you know how much ass
Terry Fox would get
if he was still alive?

167
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,013
He could start with mine.

168
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,080
Ronzy.
Go.

169
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,481
Gretz.
God.

170
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,717
Good one.
The great one.

171
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,784
Reilly.
Go.

172
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,786
Gretz.
BOTH: Get out.

173
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,921
Paulina.

174
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:01,988
BOTH: Gotcha.

175
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,590
Get it.
Jonesy.

176
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:04,658
Go.
Grande.

177
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:05,992
Ariana.
Graceful.

178
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,694
Glorious.
Gracias.

179
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,196
SHORESY:
Ariana Grande looks like
she's eight, tit‐fucker.

180
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,198
I'm givin' the pre‐school
your plate numbers.

181
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,634
ALL: Shoresy?

182
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,069
And Gretz's daughter's
a married woman,
you classless piece of shit.

183
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,571
She wouldn't fuck you
if you had

184
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,606
Mario's dangles
and Messier's dick.

185
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,841
ALL: Fuck you, Shoresy!

186
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:21,842
Fuck you, Daxi.

187
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,710
You wouldn't know what to do
with the great one.

188
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,779
He fires bigger rockets
than Elon Musk.

189
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,013
Oh, fuck you, Mary‐Anne.

190
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,516
Fuck you, Ronzy.
You're a marathon of dope.

191
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,184
Terry Fox ran
3400 miles

192
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,054
in a 143 days on one leg.

193
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:37,758
If he were alive,
he'd be gettin' handy's from
Hiltons and Hadids.

194
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,892
Fuck you, Betty‐Anne.

195
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,226
If Terry Fox was alive,

196
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,063
Gisele would be
sliding into his DM's
from Patriots' games.

197
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,264
Fuck you, Mary‐Anne!

198
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,833
If Terry Fox ran 143 days

199
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,835
he smashed 143 broads

200
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,036
and that's probably
fuckin' light.

201
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,972
ALL: Fuck you, Shoresy.

202
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,274
If Terry Fox was alive
he'd have an interview show
like Seinfeld.

203
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,643
You mean, Comedians in Cars
Getting Coffee?
Yeah.

204
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,879
But it'd be called
Canadians in Cars
Getting Blow's.

205
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,013
MARY‐ANNE:
If Terry Fox was alive

206
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,049
he'd be smashing
J‐Law and J‐Lo
on Scar‐Jo's boat.

207
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,718
He'd be boatin'
with Kylie Minogue.

208
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,019
Let's get some
fuckin' gyozas.

209
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,688
ALL: Fuck you, Shoresy!

210
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,191
Gimme a high five...

211
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,594
Oh, gimme a high five
right there.

212
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:17,097
The city is not looking
so bad right about now,
eh, big brother.

213
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,599
WAYNE: Know what?
I'm just happy to be alive

214
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,701
after sharing the expressway
with city drivers.

215
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:21,768
DARYL: Boy, howdy.

216
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,837
Did you ever notice that
every time you go to merge,

217
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,772
there just happens
to be six in‐breds

218
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,974
merging at the
exact same time?

219
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,010
Come off the ramp,
get your fuckin' foot in it.

220
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,913
Yeah. And then ya got
the wannabe Indie car drivers
who have it right to the rug

221
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,748
who kinda fly's up
behind you and kiss bumpers.

222
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,983
Like, what's your hurry's there
Jimmy Hinchcliffe's?

223
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,251
Greg Moore
was the greatest.

224
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,720
Oh, yeah, he was
the fuckin' greatest.

225
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,756
What's their hurry?
They've got a fuckin'
brunch line to go wait in.

226
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,825
All right, well,
what's the scoop here,
Katy‐Cat?

227
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,593
We gonna go find
Stewart or what?

228
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,762
Well, now hold on one
fiscal minute here, Wayne.

229
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,898
Pizza, fries, sushis,
Yogen Fruz.

230
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:52,966
I thought we were
going to the food court.

231
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,668
Of course we are, Dary.

232
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,104
Szechuan, shawarma,
stir fries, Five Guys...

233
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:01,708
We can't forgets about
Colonels Cajun BBQs and DQs.

234
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,578
Well, there's no way
we're missing Tacos
and Quiznos,

235
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,647
Chipotle and Chick‐fil‐A.

236
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,015
Wayne, we're meetin'
the skids at the club
at around midnight.

237
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,118
That's still a good six
calendar hours away, Katy.
Simmer down.

238
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,621
Yeah, but I still have to go
find something to wear.

239
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,823
Show these city girls
what's up.

240
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:19,726
All right. Let's split.

241
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,228
You wanna know what?
It's always so tough
sayin' bye to the puppies.

242
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,631
Like they're so cute
you almost don't want to.

243
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:27,634
That may be the softest thing
you've ever said, big brother.

244
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:28,735
No, it isn't.
What is?

245
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,806
"How come no one ever
compliments me
on my eyelashes?"

246
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,044
You're paraphrasing.
You fuckin' know it!

247
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,146
Is that what I'm doin'?
What I said was,

248
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,149
"I got real long eyelashes.

249
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,987
"But I'm surprised no one's
ever noticed that."

250
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,891
Gimme a high five...
high five...

251
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,795
(MIMICS DOOR KNOCKING)

252
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:55,962
Gae?

253
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,798
(MIMICS DOOR KNOCKING)

254
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,232
Roaldy.
Look!

255
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,367
Oh, this is so agitating.

256
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,468
I know. I'm frightened.

257
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:05,138
I'm referring to
the spelling and
the grammar, Roald.

258
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,873
Gives me
the coldest pricklies.

259
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,843
What have those wordsmiths
assembled for us this segment?

260
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,646
(LAUGHS) How asinine!

261
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,080
They can kiss my asinine.

262
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,381
Oh, that ass is mine...

263
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,382
I'm frightened!

264
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,952
Yet another demeaning
attempt to intimidate.

265
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,654
And this one
even better. Yeah.

266
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,723
I'm pushing the
panic button here,
you guysers.

267
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,991
Don't be such
a jellyfish, Roald!

268
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,960
My slow‐learning,
seven‐year‐old brother

269
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:30,931
even knows it's,
"If you're... y‐o‐u
apostrophe r‐e,

270
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,300
there... t‐h‐e‐r‐e tonight...

271
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,702
Comma. No period.

272
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:40,006
It's "I‐t apostrophe s...
on." Period.

273
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,875
I'd have chosen
an exclamation point.

274
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,577
I think you're right.

275
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,879
Past notes haven't
quite landed.
Do you know what I mean?

276
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,748
Yes, sans duress.

277
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,950
They don't exactly have
the tiger by the tail, do they?

278
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,919
Not exactly whipping
the excitement up to
a real fever pitch. No.

279
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,921
They are not.
For a plethora of reasons.

280
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:58,692
This death note, presumably
the final installment,
it requires urgency.

281
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,160
Some sort of accent,
I would agree.

282
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:03,029
The exclamation point guides
the reader to approach it
more threateningly.

283
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,131
Like, there's stakes there.
Like, "It's on!"

284
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,332
Right?
Exactly.

285
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,869
As opposed to a period.
Because, if it's me...
It's you.

286
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,304
I read it like... "It's on."

287
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,106
The period leaves the decision
up to the reader.

288
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,875
It does suggest
a more docile read.

289
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,110
There's no room
for ambiguity
in death threats.

290
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,411
Exclamation point?

291
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,281
Yes... Sex‐clamation point.

292
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,019
Oh...
Go stick that on the door!

293
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:31,925
Alley‐yoop.

294
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:40,100
(SIGHS) Okay.
Let's clean this shit up
and go back in.

295
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,468
I need to find
something to wear tonight.
Get my hussy on.

296
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:45,806
Give me five
calendar minutes to digest,
and I'll join ya.

297
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,774
Oh, so you're looking
to find a nice bench

298
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,976
to have a sit down
outside a lingerie store, Dary?

299
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,878
I'd be looking
for a sit down,

300
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,980
won't be no bench though.
Be the throne then, Dary?

301
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,749
Porcelain one. Can confirm.

302
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:58,084
You should have a sits down
in a public washrooms?

303
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,220
Surprised I'm not having
a sit down in a public
washroom right now.

304
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,387
You's would do such a thing's?

305
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,856
Faster than Greg fuckin' Moore.

306
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,257
How could ya, Dary?

307
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,026
How could you do such a thing's?

308
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,761
Public washrooms is disgusting.

309
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,230
Poo particles is
literally's airborne's.

310
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:13,967
Oh, ceased mingling
with the peasants again now,
have we, Dan.

311
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,136
Won't find a more
violent environments
on the planet Earth.

312
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,237
Not for my money.

313
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,839
Not for my money either.

314
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,141
Oh, how's the weather up there
in your ivory tower, Wayne?

315
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,309
Well, I'll go in,
just won't have
a sit‐down.

316
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,012
I'll rock one,
like a good old boy.
Not a monster.

317
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:28,048
Must be nice
to have the option.

318
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,950
Well, I just get
the giggles is all.

319
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:33,119
Ain't nothin' to giggle about
in a cesspool of fecal matters
and pee‐pees.

320
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,420
Sure there is.
What?

321
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:37,157
Well... farts.

322
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,126
Ew.
Well, there's nothin' funnier
than a fart.

323
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,562
Except kids
fallin' off bikes maybe.

324
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,097
Fuck, I could watch kids
fall off bikes all fiscal day.

325
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,298
I don't give a shit
about your kids.

326
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,833
DARYL: Oh, yeah,
it's super funny.

327
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,035
You just be standing there,
rocking a piss,

328
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,337
dude will come up
next to you.
Just rip a fart.

329
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,840
How is that funny?
Dude droppin'
his guts like that?

330
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,108
I take's exceptions to it.

331
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,110
Well, you're supposed
to be standing there,

332
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,113
nobody'll say nothing,
you'll be rockin' one,
peacefully.

333
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,848
Then you just rip a fart.

334
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,917
It's not funny's.
It's fuckin' hilarious.

335
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,352
What is your guys
fascination with farts?

336
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,322
Well, you don't know him.
He doesn't know you.

337
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,257
He ain't never heard one
like that before.

338
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,126
Yeah, farts will never
not be funny.

339
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,261
I will never
not laugh at a fart.

340
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,066
There's even a courtesy
aspect of it, too.

341
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,467
Ah, this should be interesting.

342
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:23,403
Well, like if you go
into a public bathroom,

343
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,271
there's a guy in a stall,

344
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,372
he'll announce his
presence to you.

345
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,574
Like how?

346
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:29,510
He's sittin' there
and maybe he'll clear
his throat.

347
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:31,612
Like... (CLEARS THROAT)

348
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,213
That's exactly
how they do it, Dary.

349
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,048
They go... (CLEARS THROAT)

350
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,283
Why would he want to announce
that he's having a sit down?

351
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,419
Well, the first sound
you hear is not a fart.

352
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,954
He's prepping you
for the acoustics.

353
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,589
And how is that courteous?

354
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,991
Well, let's say you're like me,
you get the giggles.

355
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:48,094
From a fart?
I get the giggles
from a fart, yes.

356
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,063
You're in there,
you're at the urinal,

357
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,298
you hear a fart,
you giggle a wee bit.

358
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,267
Get shaking.
Piss goes everywhere.

359
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,570
How do you think
the pee's particles
gets airborne's?

360
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:57,971
DARYL: It's weird,

361
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,306
'cause dudes will fart
in front of each other
any day of the week.

362
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,008
Soon as you get
into a public stall,

363
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,510
want to announce
their presence.

364
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:05,278
Make sure one doesn't
sneak up on ya.

365
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,580
But it's a public bathroom.

366
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,114
You're supposed to hear
those sorts of sounds.

367
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,315
It's just different
in there, Katy.

368
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,884
It's more intimate.
Come off it.

369
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,253
Some dudes want
to announce themselves
by sniffing,

370
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,655
which is not
the right avenue.

371
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,356
Ain't nothin' in there
you wanna be sniffin'.

372
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,491
No, I'm gonna tell ya.
All right, come on, Dary.
Let's go.

373
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,928
You guys should make some
betters efforts to avoid
bacteria's exposures.

374
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:25,131
Good hygiene is the
only jeans that never
goes out of styles.

375
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,901
Dan, I think that might be
the softest thing
you've ever said.

376
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,970
No, it isn't.
What is?

377
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,574
Okay.

378
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,376
One time my perennials
didn't come in for
the second year,

379
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,045
and you knows perennials
is exposed to live

380
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,081
more than two years.

381
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,448
So, I says,

382
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,119
"I'm so upset
about my perennials."

383
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,157
KATY: Yikes.

384
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,328

We can help with this.

We don't want these dudes
in the club either.

Thanks, but some hicks are
coming from Letterkenny
and they're taking us home.

Good luck getting him
away from that.

good fuckin'...

Mmm‐hmm.

(WHISPERING) There may be
animals being harmed in there.

396
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,129
Listen to me.
Some hicks from Letterkenny
aren't gonna do it.

397
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,196
These dudes roll deep.

398
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,332
Take this shit seriously.

399
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,100
You're keeping us safe.
Even though it's not supposed
to be safe 'cause it's drugs.

400
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,236
And we appreciate it.
But you're dealing
on their turf.

401
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,604

'til you're off it.

00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,734
And a lot of them
condo buildings

464
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:29,736
just looks like
human storages to me.

465
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,404
Pretty fuckin' serious, skid?

466
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,439
Mortally fuckin' serious, hick.

467
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,641
It's time to come home, Stewart.

468
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,309
Can we leave now?
No!

469
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,544
Train ain't
comin' back, buds.

470
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:38,679
Stewart?

471
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:39,946
I said no‐ah!

472
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,716
Stewart, we gotta
lay low for a while.

473
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,851
What about...
You go your way.
I'll go another.

474
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,353
It's best we split up.

475
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,390
What about the...
Just...just for now.

476
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,961
I know what comes next.

477
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:57,831
Stewart...
Gae.

478
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:58,899
(SQUEAKS) Stewart?
Roald!

479
00:19:58,932 --> 00:19:59,933
Why do you rebel?

480
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,636
I hate my parents.

481
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:03,970
And?
I hate the world.

482
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:05,572
And...

483
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,242
I hate myself.

484
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,712
Get this guy
a fuckin' Puppers...

485
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:13,747
(SOBBING)

486
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,616
It's not going anywhere
any time soon.

487
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,984
No.

488
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,621
We'll rebel again.

489
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,628
All right,
we need to split too.

490
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:31,798
Um, Miss Katy's?
What?

491
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:35,468
Was I's able's
to successfully's...

492
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,704
Stay off
my dick today, Dan?

493
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,006
Yes.

494
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,643
And yes, you may.
Gimme competition!

495
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,978
You know what?
It's better with
an even number.
