You're discussing critical space stuff with your pals the other day. How would you batch in space? With immaculate care. Yeah, it'd go airborne if you didn't contain it. Depends on the length of the missions, I thinks. Like, if it's a pretty short mission, you can probably gets away without mixing a batch up theres. Maybe you can get away without mixing a batch. I mix one every night or I'm not sleeping. Kind of likes how I needs to takes a shower immediately afters I takes a shits? You'd cone it. What? Each spaceman's given a cone, put over your junk, for when you batch in space. They do? So let's say you're in your space quarters, you lay on your back in your bunk, put the cone over your junk and fire one up, and since it's zero gravity, your batch'd float up to the top of the cone, and remain there. Then what'll you do with it? Each cadet's got a space disposal in their quarters, so he'll just throw it in there. That what they do? Most important thing is to obstruct the space cam in your quarters so that the rest of the space cadets don't see you batching. I'd imagine they'd give you a few cones. Probably stick one of those cones over the camera. Exactly. Wayne? Dan. How did youse acquires this knowledge? You remember when I took Angie down Disney? Yeah. Was having drinks in a bar by Cape Canaveral and heard some cadets talking. Space cadets? Don't fuckin' piss me off, Dary. Isn't Cape Canaverals a ways away from Disney? It's not that far. Okay. You're having a drinks in Capes Canaverals and you overhear some cadets talk something about mixing a batch ups in space? Did I stutter? Crazier things have happened, I guess. Was Bondars there? Roberta? Yeah, Robertas Bondars, neuroscientist, Canada's first female astronauts. Fucking legend, Robertas Bondars. Yeah, Bondar was there. Nice. What about the other guy, um, what's his name? He just left, apparently. Wow, rubbing shoulders with North America's finest space cadets. Yeah. Bondar hammered? No. No, I seen her crash a few Old Fashioneds, but she was actually sitting in a quiet corner by herself. Wonder why the other guys left. I don't have that information, Dan. Can you imagine if North America's finest space cadets went ups into outer space togethers? Oh, they did. They dids? Yup. Houston wanted them to go up there together again, too. Bondar didn't wanna. Why nots? I don't think you wanna know. Well, sures, we dos. Look, youse didn't hear this from me, all right? All right. Dary, all right? All right. Look, a lot of people don't know this, but those two weren't just North America's finest spacemen, they were actually planet Earth's finest space people. So, of course, Houston wanted them up there together as much as possible. But they only went up theres togethers the one time? Yep. 'Cause Bondars didn't wants to go up theres with him agains. Yeah. Okay. So, like, he was as a bit of a guy's guy around Kennedy Center. You know, he played pranks and stuff, and they'd just say, Well, that's just him. Of course, Bondar was the more senior spaceman, had a bit of a reputation for, like, kicking it oldschool. Hence, the Old Fashioneds. So she didn't have a lot of time for the whole boyswillbeboys mentality. 'Kay. So, they finally shoehorned them up there together, knowin' full well it was oil and water. And I guess you can say he proved them right. Those space cadets really tell tales out of school, eh? Yep. What happened next? So, each spaceman's got a space cam in their quarters which are connected to the other spacemen's quarters, as well as the main shuttle bay and the saucer section, the two smaller bays and the stardrive section. They'd be connected to the main bridge? Of course, they are, Dary. Fuck's sake. So, we're talking about an elite vessel here? NASA'd never send a ship up there if it wasn't galaxy class. You bet they wouldn't. Same with Elon Musk, but apparently Russia does it all the time. Fucking joke star fleet. So, what happened next? So, Bondar'd be up in Alpha quadrant, keeping the Captain's log, likely, of the events. Yeah. And they'd all just come out of a Yeager loop, so she was a bit worn out. Yeah, she wouldn't be at full bars. But, of course, there's Bondar still up there in Alpha, keeping an eye out for wormholes and what not. Yeah. I guess there he'd be down there in Beta quadrant, floating around in space quarters, which Bondar could see, so could Houston. I guess what he'd do is float offcamera, pull his space pants down, grab his junk in a bunch in his hands. Like dinkerball? Sake, Dary. This is hard enough to get through without you stopping all over his story, Dary. Sorry, good buddy. So, there he'd be floating off camera. I guess what he'd do. Allegedlys. .according to the cadets, is dip just his junk back into frame. No. Apparently did it all the time. Where's Houston in all this? Houston thought it was hilarious. But Bondar didn't? Nope. Bondar did not. Jesus Christ. I guess then what he'd do is he'd get on his comms. Allegedlys. Just telling you what the cadets told me. He'd go like, Hey, Bondar, check out space cam six. No. Yep. She report him? Oh, she reported it. Did they slap sanctions on him? Yeah. Yeah, he got jacked up. Good for Houstons. Mmmhmm. Of course, they were still supposed to be up there another two months together, and things only got worse. How? Remember what I was saying about the cone? Yeah? I guess whenever it was Bondar's turn to clean Beta quadrant, he would routinely batch and not cone it. Inexcusables! I ain't Bondar to tell you that's an understatement. I think she would, too. No, she never expected to be floating around some spaceman's quarters trying to catch airborne ejaculate in a plastic vacuum bag when she signed up for space camp. No, they only tell you about omega particles at space camp. Mmmhmm. This went on for two more months? Oh, no way, Dan. Oh, you better believe Houston aborted the mission. Bondar had strict orders to Picard Maneuver and warp 10 home. How many light years away were they? I was gonna ask, but then the cadets would know I was eavesdropping, so. Then what happened? They bring Bondar in for topsecret meeting, airtight boardroom, patdown, spawn entry, no cell phones inside and they said, Well, what do you wanna do here, Bondar? Lets him have it. No. No? No. You remember how I said she's oldschool. Yeah. Bondar says to him, she says, I'm gonna be down at the bar drinking Old Fashioneds. That guy's gonna get what's coming to him. Fucking buzzed herself out of the boardroom. Dids he? Well, Dan, one of them's up in space doing space activities, the other one's at a bar by Disney drinking Old Fashioneds. That woman is the portrait of class. She always has been. God bless yas, Robertas Bondars. Now, you can't be especially sure those were even real space cadets at the bar by Kennedy that day on account of being so close to Disney. Could have just been playing pretend or cosplaying, like so many in that area like to do. But if there weren't over there spinning the yarn, fucking Bondar for Prime Minister, eh? Allo. Oui, hello. Do it. Bae, no. Oh, come on, we talked about this. I told you MariePierre had to see it, and now, she's here. All right. Youse are sure you're laughing with me and not at me, eh? Absolutely not. Good enough. Is Katy there? Sup? Sup? Can you hold the camera for us? Sure. Oh, 'cause he's gonna do that thing for that second verse, right? Yup, the thing for the second verse is why we're here, lady. Gotcha. Ah, youse the luckiest. Caught me halfcaught here, fuck. All right, here goes. Oh! Bye!. Things we do for love, eh, big brother? Well, it's a keeper if ever there was one, bud. You looks like you're in a bad way over there, Dary. Yeah, I'm in a real bad way. Have a beer. I'm good. Ah, I don't need a beer either. Was actually thinking about a water. Ah, for hell, I'm having one. No one's driving, right? I'd have a beer. Atta boy. What's the matter, Dary? I just. I haven't talked to Anik in a bit. I haven't seen Aniks in a fortnight. A fortnight? Who the fuck are you? What she been up to, Dary? I don't know. I do. You do? Yeah, I've got Anik on Instagram. She has an Instagram? Airball! Dary, you don't know about Anik's Instagram? Katy, my butt cheeks are clenched up real tight right here. So, whatever you're driving at, get after it. Okay. I love a girl who knows what she wants and gets it, and I love Anik. But her Instagrams, I mean, I love this too, but it's skanky. Uhoh! A little Skank Sinatra? Little Skank Zappa? Skank Ocean. Oh, bother. What're we talking about here, little Tom Skanks? Little Skank Aaron? Skanklin D. Roosevelt. Can I see? Are your butt cheeks still clenched? Yes. Oh. That's a lot of likes. Well, life's a drive through, bud. Gotta just. Just keep moving forward. So, should. Should I do something? Well, she hasn't called you and she's posting motherfucking sexy photos, like, three times a day, so, perhaps. Wayne? Dary? What would you do if your gal had like a real racy Instagram account? Well, I haven't had to cross that bridge yet, good buddy, but she'd be a shaky one. She'd be dangerous. She'd be Muay Thai jai alai. Take an eye, big brother. Yeah, I'd have an eye. Oh! In the words of Scottie Wallis. That's what I said. I said. There's no way the photos can be that. Holy fucking. We're talking Y to the E to the W! I'm looking at yew! Come on, give me a big old, yew, boy! All right, big brother, let's get out of here. Where we going? You're not going anywhere. Yeah, you stay here, we gotta go get. Get something sorted. Where is Scottie Wallis anyways? He keeps poor company! You know, it's kind of suspicious. Twos of youse going off to someplace we'res not allowed to go to. Kind of makes a feller wonder. I'm not gonna ask any questions, 'cause I'm pretty sure I'll find out, sooner rather than later! Bad gas travels fast in a small town! Hey, do you think that, like, the other people in town know about her racy Instagram account? Well, Dary, we have previously established that bad gas does travel fast in a smalls town. But, uh, I do believe racy photos travel faster. Oh, I'm getting hammered. We're out of beers, bud. Then come with me to MoDeans? You don't have to ask me twice. Yew! Oh, fuck. There he is. Scottie Wallis. You need a big old yew! I stop the world and met with yew! New York, I love yew! Looks like she's just not that into yew! Bad gas travels fast in a small town.

Sixteen point one thousand. Yew! I wailed on it before I got here, but I'd wail on it again. Yew! I just hammered on it too, but, Dary, yew! Scottie Wallis here? No. Thought we heard Scottie Wallis. What's the kerfuffle? Daryl sweetie's Instagram. Yew! Oh. I just jerked off to that. And I just jerked off to that. Jerked off to what? Stewart was just saying that he jerked off to Daryl sweetie's Instagram, and I was just saying that I jerked off to Stewart jerking off to Daryl sweetie's Instagram. You're gay? Super gay. Yeah.

I haven't been able to get a hold of you for about a week. Seems that everybody in Letterkenny is j. Jerks don't deserve your time. Probably best I didn't say the word. Look, I won't be coming around anymore. I wanted to tell you face to face. But why? Because you're Instagram famous now? No. Because I heard that doesn't have much of a shelf life according to BuzzFeed. Your'e too clingy, Daryl. You need to learn to give a girl space. Oh, bother. And I'm working things out with JeanClaude. I was impulsive in leaving him. Especially how I did. I got cold feet. We are none of us perfect. Does JeanClaude know about your racy Instagram photos? Love is trust. Well. That was a hells of a time to be rocking a piss. She comes by, says all them personal things, thinking youse are alone, but, no. No, I was here the whole time. I heards everythings. So, hey, maybes now you can enjoy her racy Instagrams like the rest of us, you know, without personal feelings, or insecurities seeping throughs, 'cause. You know. 'Cause. Yew! Well? Well. Here we go now. Here we go now. I heard. Bad gas travels fast in a small towns. I love that girl, Dary, but it's for the best. What's for the best? Dary and his gal. Skank Stallone? So, Daryl's single? Wanna dance? Always a silver lining. What are you looking at? Dary's exsweetie's Instagrams. Check out this one hot off the presses. I know what Scottie Wallis would say. He'd say, Yew! I was just gonna say that, I was gonna say, Yew!. Yew! Oh, Scottie Wallis. He keeps poor companies. What do you mean? Yew! I got a ticket. Shocker, lead foot. You just talked yourself out of something, dark bread. I got a question for you. Okay. Ask me inside. It's cold. The dog gave you a wee bit of a scare the other day. A stroke? That's what I said. But he didn't have a stroke. That's what they said. Why'd you thinks he was havin' a strokes? Well, he was out layin' in the sun for a few hours, when he came back up the house, his back end was all honey dick. How so? Well, it was like he was trying to walk and scratch himself at the same time and his brain couldn't figure out which one to focus on. So what did you do? I said, Oh, fuck, this is it. Is that what you did? I said, Oh, fuck, you're getting the needle. Better get one ready for me, too. He's okay, good buddy. Oh, fuck, If we're diggin' a hole, better dig a big one, I'm gettin' in there with him. But it's all been sorted? Oh, it's all sorted but I said, Oh, fuck, Dary. Yeah, we oughta leave this world behind. That's what I said. You knew that he was on bladder meds for the last three weeks. Fuckin' geezer. And that he'd be passing the bladder stones sometime around now and to expect some odd behavior, you still go worst case scenario? I said, Oh, fuck, this is it. And what was the verdict? Passin' bladder stones. Exactly. Just passing some bladder stones. There a fuckin' echo in here, Katy? I think he faked it. Faked what? A stroke. Why would the dog fakes a strokes? Gus faked a stroke so that he could go to the vet and get a thermometer up the bum. Look, if you're comin'. you better come correct. Well, look how Stormy responds to a thermometer up the bum. Hates her life. No time for a knuckler there either. No time for a twoknuckler. There's no such thing as a threeknuckler. Which we've established. Cito, too. Even the sight of a thermometer, send him scrambling. Yeah. God help the vet tries to throw a knuckler up Cito's bum. Vet might not get that one back. What are you sayin' here, Katy? I'm saying that Gus is. Look, if you're comin'. you better come correct! Gus is gay. No, he isn't. Yeah, he is. No, he isn't. Yeah, he is. Have you ever seen him mount a female? He's a gentleman. But you've seen him mount countless males. He'd mount the redhot tailpipe of a high CC quad. Katy, come off it! What if he is gay? What's the big deal? I don't give a fuck if he's gay. Maybe you do. Maybe you think that. Just gimme a minute. Gotta let that. Gotta let that marinate. Hey, Dary, what if Gus was gay? I don't give a fuck if he's gay. Dan, what if Gus is gay? Well, Professor Tricia's. I withdraw. See, Wayne, Gus is gay. What's the big deal? I already said I don't give a fuck if he's gay. Well, that makes me very happy. Just don't, uh. Don't go sayin' that around McMurray. Why? McMurray gets weird about that stuff. How so? Like, he's fine with it, if you're gay. If you're queer. Maybe he'd like to get honey dickin'. He just, uh, gets kind of weird talkin' about it, is all. How does he talk about it? Well, he'll just get all uncomfortable, you know. He'll be like, ahem. Uh, you know, if one of them come up to me and say, 'You're fuckin' cute, bud.' From what I said right from the start at the very beginning, 'I ain't one of ya.' That is about the best shit I've heard all day. Ahem, If they ever come up to me and say, 'Fuck, are you cute, bud.' You wanna know what I said right from the start at the very beginning? Yeah, uh, I. I love my wife. And you know, uh. Keep it away from me? No. not around me. Because, I ain't one of ya. This is fascinating. You know, Professor Tricia. You know what, Dan? Enough!. Ahem, I ain't one of ya. No, but, uh, yous got your street, yous got your day and from what I'm told, yous are here to stay. Just keep it away from me, 'cause I ain't one of ya. L.O.L. You know why? I don't really care, I mean, I don't like being told what to do myself there, either. Yous got your street. Yous got your day. Oh, boy, do I love my wife and, boy, she loves me. From what I'm told yous are here to stay. Not anywhere near me. Ahem, I ain't one of ya, but, uh, you know, you can think I'm cute, but, uh, you know, you're a good enough guy, but, uh, I see we both like tight Tshirts, but. We can have a beer, but nothin' else. 'Cause I ain't one of ya. Talkin' about, uh. You know, maybe, maybe you ever been to 'Pulco? What you never been down 'Cun? Ever been down to that 'Minican? Ever been down Caico? Gotta go down to Caicos, you never been to Caicos. Plenty of yous in the Florida Keys. Florida Keys, Florida for me's. Plenty of yous down Key West. I love the Key West. Key West is the best. Plenty of yous down Miami. Oh, hot jimmydonbobby, I been down to Miami. You all right with it if the dog's gay? Much told gays are here to stay. So. Guess he does always spring that red rocket when he's up on your lap. So that was in the cards. Snipes. Oh. snipers. Hey, boys, quick row down? Yeah, quick powwow, boys. You guys sure you want your snipers just cruising in there unattended? Chest puffer convention in there, boys. Dudes walking around with watermelons under each arm. Nothin' to worry about there. Uh, no reason not to trust her 'til she gives you one, boy. Wow, that's a mature approach, boys. Thinking the game far beyond your years, boys. You guys comin' to bush party tonight? You bet. You? The bush party we're hosting? Yeah. Perhaps. Mmm. boys. Boys! We got a bet going with Ronsy and Daxy. Who can tally the most take downs. That's a mature approach, boys. Thinking the game far beyond your years, boys. Mmm. All the college and uni tail home for the summer, boys. Gotta get it while the getting's goodest and the goods about to get got, get it? Got it. Good. More to that. The college and uni kids that are home that have taken their fightin' skills to the city for a year, they're thinkin' they're tougher than nails. More to that. There's a chest puffer in there beaking about being the toughest guy in his college town. And I think you know what that means. Well, are you gonna tell me? Well, if he's sayin' that he's the toughest guy in his college town, college towns are bigger than our town and that would also make him the toughest guy in. The toughest guy in Letterkenny. Who's the toughest guy in Letterkenny? Here we go now. Just givin' you a heads up. More to that. Suckers are fair game at a bush party. Yeah, like, if you see a dude giving me the stink eye, best just walk over there and sucker him. Yeah, because he's likely thinking about suckering you. Now you don't wanna get suckered. Yeah, we know the rules at a bush party, boys. All about the W's at a bush party, boys. They don't ask how, they ask how many at a bush party. Some chest puffer in there saying he's the toughest guy in Letterkenny. How'd that work out for you, JB? One's the loneliest number, bud. Yeah, well, second place is first loser. Lotta chin waggin' going on in there, eh? Yous ready? You tellin' me I don't look it? Heads on a swivel, boys. Use your peripherals. Who the fuck are you? Him or me, boys. Only rule of suckers. Here we go now! Holy shit, you just hop off a horse or were ya fucked up the ass? Tough carrying around those watermelons all day, pheasant? Enjoy the water weight 'til your creatine runs out, bud. You're gonna look like someone stuck a fuckin' pin in ya. Breathe, pilon. You're gonna get fuckin' hemorrhoids. Way to hustle, bro. Fuck, you could cut the sexual tension over there with a knife. Give your balls a tug, tit fucker. Fuck you, Shoresy. Put a shirt on. Fuck you, Reilly. Go scoop it off your mom's bedroom floor for me. She gives my nipples butterfly kisses. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, Jonesy. Your mom shot cum straight across the room and killed my Siamese Fighting Fish. Threw off the pH levels in my aquarium, you piece of shit. Fuck you, Shoresy. Do you hear yourself? Fuck you, Reilly. Should have heard your mom last night, she sounded like a window closing on a Tonkinese cat's tail. Sounded like, Ah. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, Jonesy. Should have heard your mom last night. She sounded like my greataunt when I pull a surprise visit. She was like, Oh. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, Reilly. Your mom sneaky gushed so hard, she bucked me off the waterbed last night. Don't tell her I was thinking about Jonesy's mom the entire time! Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, Jonesy. Your mom ugly cried 'cause she left the lens cap on the camcorder last night. It's fuckin' amateur hour over there!.  Fuck you, Shoresy! That's it, Roaldy. Just enough to turn it green. I never thought I'd be able to put a wholesome spin on drug dealing, but here we are. GHB is the best party drug when used properly. What's it like? It's like the chattiness of good blow, with the euphoric high of good M. No way! And half the come down. No way. And you keep your appetite. Deelish. Kinda just flail. Holee. But when used improperly, it's the date rape drug. Ew. That's why we put green dye in it. In case some financial district chauch with contentious intentions tries to slip it into some girl's drink. .she'll know. I'd sure like to try it. I like sober Roald. I like sober Gae. Gae. Can't feel my legs. Not as much as I like sober Stewart. We'll go to the club at midnight. Sure thing, partner. Make that 30. Nope. And you better not be the ones who have been cropdusting this place for the past half hour. It's fuckin' gross. What are you doing? I don't know, straw bales and barley. Just between us girls? I'm a little concerned about my electrolytes. Feels like they're a little bit depleted. You gotta stay hydrated. Look, if your pee isn't clear, you're not hydrated. Just gotta approach this thing like a marathon runner. Throwin' so much hip in this sort of weather's a great way to get heat stroke. Ever had heat stroke? No. You don't want it. I'm actually surprised to see you out here doing this. Suppose you gotta find time for other things, though. The day'll get away on ya. You know, I don't mean to bring this up to your back door like this or anything. No, no. If a friend asks for help, you help him. I'm not complaining. I know you better than that. Just. just between us girls? Just between us girls. Girl talk. Girl talk. Whoever did that, that's fuckin' Timbits hockey. That's Saturday morning tyke skills camp. Hey, nice butt. Let's get some fuckin' bubble tea! Hey! We said watch our drinks. Fuckin' idiot! I did! No, you didn't. Look! Why are they green? Because someone put G in them. G's not green. Yes, it is!. No, it isn't. Yes, it is. And you shouldn't sell that stuff anymore. It's not safe. It's not supposed to be safe. It's drugs. It doesn't matter anyway. No one will buy it from you that way. Let's go find who's selling the green stuff. Whoa, whoa, whoa! What? Somebody else is selling in here? Yeah. And keeping us safe. Some vigilante shit. And when a girl asks you to watch her drink, watch her fuckin' drink. Fucking idiot! 'Lo. Of course I'll be there, it's on the property. 'Kay. Chest puffer's coming. Chch. What. what's going on there? Take downs, by the looks of it. No. With the Amish girls. No, they're not Amish. They're Mennonite. What's the difference? Mennonites can use cars and electricity. Amish can't. Mennonappers. Mennonight riders. Shmelly's. They're in this period of their lives called Rumspringa where they can just carry on like the rest of us for a while. Call us the English. Yeah. We're in the English world. We've been called worse. They can co to parties and be shit heads without any consequence from their parents. They can still go home and have a bed to sleep in no matter what. Why just let them go be shit heads? Well, it's to help them decide whether or not they want to stay in the English world permanently or go back to the Mennonite world and be with their families. What's in the Mennonite world? Whole lotta chorin'. Great pride in community. Generations and generations of inbreedings. How many stay in the English world? Few. But some do?. Yep. Some do. Roald! Stewart! Has our modus operandi escaped you? Stewart? Our M. O.! Fuck emo. Inconspicuous! I'm to spit in this? Veil your transactions. I'm down for trans action. Keep your dealings disclosed, lest we be made manifest. Are you guys sellin' the green G? That's us! Shh! Pleasure. This is some vigilante shit. Grazie. Wayne! Who the fuck are you? I'm the toughest guy in Letterkenny. Chch. Have an eye for suckers. We got 'em. Can I have a stick of gum? Yeah, you wanna stick? Yeah, I'll have a stick, if you got a stick. Stick of gum. I'll maybe take a second stick. More than one stick? Was drinkin' from the hose. It's a wee bit rusty down the line. That sounds like a twostick fire to me. Dary? Yeah? Say about. About. Okay. You gots a sticks of gum? Yeah, you wanna stick? If you gots a sticks, I'd takes a stick. Stick of gum. You got more than one stick? Yeah, you want more than one stick of gum? I drank some OJ's after brushin' my teeth. So, I'm breathin' fires. Yup, sounds like you need more than one stick. Dan? Say about. Abouts. 'Kay. Hey, you want a stick of gum? I know you've got a stick of gum. Yeah, I got a stick. Give me a stick. Stick of gum. I'll take another one for later too. More than one stick of gum? Yeah, I had some Gus & Bru in my coffee this morning. Yeah? You'll need more than one stick. Katy? Yeah? Say. About. About. 'Kay. Why do you keep asking us to say that, good buddy? Well. A GI Jehovah come up the laneway the other day. And he said it like, aboat. Aboat? Yes, like if you're out on the water, you're in. A boat. I ain't never heard no one says it like, aboats. That's a weird way to say, about. Well, to be fair.  To be fair To be fair, Yanks think we got a weird way of saying about. Yeah, what's that's all abouts? Well, they say it like, abowt. Abowt? Yeah, and they make fun of us for saying, about. No, I'm pretty sure Yanks make fun of us for sayin' aboot. Who says aboot? Ask a fuckin' Yank. A boot. Abowt. Aboot. And now. Aboat. Well, what did the GI have to say? Well. It's about heart, it's about passion, it's about discipline. It's about not having Christmas, isn't it? It's about so much more than you think it's about. So what did you do? Waste his time a wee bit, as you do. Well, then why don't you tell me what it's about? It's about Jesus, being God's only direct creation. It's about not drinkin', isn't it? It's about not watching R rated movies, as well. Well, it's for sure about not dancing. Pretty sure someone told me one time that's what it's about. For sure. It's about not listening to music containing immoral lyrics. What's your fuckin' name? Bob. Bob, tell me, what's good about it? Yeah, but what did he have to say? You wanna know what? Phone rang and went inside to get it, kinda forgot he was out there, so must have skedaddled. No! And I'd be more than happy to continue telling you what being a Jehovah's Witness is all about. How about I leave you behind some literature? What's your fuckin' name again? Bob. Get the fuck outta here, Bob. Okay. Hey! What'd you get into? He could use a stick of gum. Oh, Mennonites. Mennonappers. Fuck, can they run, those Nappers. That looks like Noah Dyck. And Anita Dyck. Wayne. Mr. Dyck. Dyck with a Y, yes. Daryl. Mrs. Dyck. Wayne, feel free to call me Noah Dyck. And, Daryl, please continue to call me Mrs. Dyck. Brings ya up the laneway? Wayne, your family's always been very good to our community and we appreciate it, once. You've used us right and hopefully you feel as though we've used you right, too. Without question. We appreciate it, once. Which is why I know I can count on your discretion. Especially in a matter as sensitive as this one. Can confirm. Okay. This is not easy to say, nor is it by any means an accusation. Where are our daughters? Anita Dyck. Now. Please. Our daughter, Charity. Charity Dyck? And her sister Chastity. Chastity Dyck? Are on their gap year, once. Isn't that called Rumspringa? Men are talking, Daryl. Anita Dyck and I are concerned that our little Dycks have been bitten, by the good time bug. And while Dycks have been known to slip out on occasion, our fear is that our Dycks have been out longer than we're comfortable with, once. Have you seen our Dycks? About yea tall, once. Strong nose, like their father, strongwilled, like their mother. I did see them at the bush party, actually. Dycks at a bush party, you say? I knew it. Shameful. Haven't seen them since though, truth be told. Katy, you seen a Dyck or two? That's a loaded question, big brother. Hello, Katy. Noah. Anita. Katherine. Lovely day. What brings you guys by? We heard out daughters were here and. Charity and. We'll take all the Charity Dyck you've got. All the Chastity Dyck, too. We want Charity and Chastity home before they get swayed into a life of bad decisions, once. They are free to decide whether the English world is for them. That is their right. But our Dycks belong in the hands of the Mennonite community. And we would like to gently suggest to them that they return home with us before they've been too exposed. Well, the last I saw them, they were with hockey players. I offered to give them a ride home but, they said that they wanted to walk. We Dycks can be hardheaded. Hockey players have quite the reputation for sticking their noses, and other things, where they don't belong. Can confirm. Oh, dear. My goodness. Good heavens. Heaven only knows. Well, the good news is, there's only a couple of places hockey players tend to hang out. Yeah, the gym or the barn. The barn? Oh, dear. My goodness. Good heavens. Heaven only knows. The hayloft. Intertwined in breathy clusters. Look, I should clarify. The barn, as in the hockey rink. Yeah, you're looking for two puck heads drivin' a Tonka truck. That's Reilly and Jonesy. And Noah, please go ahead and let us know if there's anything else we can do to help. Wayne, our entire community thanks you for your kindness as you've shown us here this day, once. Well, it looks like a couple of Dycks. Oh, hello there, Daniel. Haven't seen you in the age of a dog. Well, until soon. Goddamn Schmellies. Whoa. And a good day to ye both. I'm Noah Dyck, with a Y. And this is my wife. Anita Dyck. Ah, that's Jonesy. That's Reilly. Hello. Sorry to bother you, but we were wondering if. Where are our daughters? Yes. Dunno. Ditto. Sorry for the confusion. It's just that Wayne seemed to think you might have seen our Dycks. Oh, those Dycks. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Charity and, um. The other one. Chastity. Yeah. Yeah, it's all coming back to me now. We, we, we met them. But we didn't, like, meet them. No, definitely never met them. Well, have you seen them? Not, like, seen them, if that's what you mean. We're definitely not seeing your Dycks. You know what I mean? You know what I mean? No. But I do know this. If I find out you're lying to me, the wrath of an angry Dyck will leave a lasting mark. Once. Well, maybe check the Dollar Store. They may be dancing with the skids or something. Thank you so much for your time. Praise be to God. Praise be to Him. Praise be to you. Praise be. Well, blessed is the fruit. May the Lord open. Must be a new translation. What the fuck was that? You almost blew it! Charity! You know, you guys have been around like, a lot. The Dycks love the English world. Yeah, but I mean, the Mennonite world has its perks, too, I'm sure. Just put a little English on a Dyck. And we'll put a little Mennonite on a penis. Dan, why do you hate Mennonites so much? They're nice people, good workers. They're great workers. Good runners, too. Fuck, can they run. They drive a hard bargain on the business side. Yeah, can be a wee bit sheisty. Oh, they run like the wind. Every one of them can run. Tight with money. Great workers. They'll show you a thing or two about good work. They'll beat you in a race, boy. Fuck, can they run. Just because I respects them don't means I can't hates them. I'm gonna need a minute with that. That was like a quadruple negative. Well, how can you hate 'em? They're harmless. That's what they wants you to think. But deep down they're judgier than Judge Reinhold and Judge Judy watching Judge Dredds. Oh, is that what they are? I was fifteens at the time. Is that what you were? It was the Letterkenny Days picnic, hottest day in July. I believe yous were away at a balls tournament. The Jeff Davies Memorial. Jeff Davies was fast too. Not as fast as a Napper, though. Fuck, can they run. Anyhoo, it was the tater sack race. I always hated them. Burlap burns. First prize was an icecold glass of lemonades. We lined up at the start line and looked across to the finish line and there she was. A little Schmellie, holdin' up the prize lemonades, almost like a mirage. That's my favorite alltime chocolate bar. We locked eyes and smiled. Despite her broad shoulders, she was cute as a bug's horn. Good runner, too, no doubt. I was in first place coming down to the finish line, like the wind. So I guess you could say you had it in the bag? Heyo! Heyo! I did. When out of nowhere, this. Schmellie in a sack. No, I told you they were fast. I'm the one who's been saying this entire time how fast they are. Fuck, can they run. He comes tearing up from behinds me, knocks me over, ass over teakettles. Wasn't he disqualified? No. Well, Schmellies are sheisty. Yeah, he should have been DQ'd like a chocolatedipped cone. So who was he? Who's to say? It all happened so fast. I've never seens that Schmellie before or since. Alls I know is I watched him hop across the finish line upside down and claim my prize. Why was he upside down? He wasn't. I was. I ates it. Never got to the lemonade. Never got to chats with her. I never even seens her again. But I'll never forgets her. And guess who she was?. Who? Lovina Dyck. Lovina Dyck? That's right, Lovina Dyck. Younger sister of one Noah Dyck! Yeah, I know who that is. Fuck, she can run, boy. So you had a crush on a Schmellie? I did. And I had my hearts broken that day. And ever since then I have never trusted a Mennonapper. So, Lovina Dyck is the one who got away for Squirrelly Dan. What if Dan ended up with a Schmellie? And a Schmellie Dyck even? Let's try and find a way to never say Schmellie and Dyck in the same sentence. I do often wonders what's ever happeneds to her. Fuck, can they run. Whoa. Hello unto ye. I am Noah Dyck and this is my wife, Anita Dyck. How do you spell that? Why, with a Y, of course. Sure you guys aren't dykes? We are hoping you can help us find our daughters. How many do you have? Two. Oh. A pair of Dycks. Stewart!. Your Dycks are not our responsibility. Stewart! Maybe we have done awful things to them and they're sleeping it off in our tenement right now. But they'll dance again. Dance is a vertical expression of a horizontal intention. And I will urge you to never let your intentions be known in the presence of mine wife ever again, once. Why? I bet she's. Mennotight. Care to explore each other while the Mennonight is still young? Anita Dyck! Watch what you say, please, with your pink mouth, once. Ow! On the day of judgement, He will gather all nations, separate the sheep from the right and goats on the left. Which are you, sheep or goat? Sheep or goat? Goat! Goat? Where are my daughters? Names? Uh, Charity Dyck. Bless you. And Chastity Dyck. I've not seen a Charity Dyck. I've no use for a Chastity Dyck. Good. Yous are pure sinful. You Dycks appear firm. In your beliefs. Stewart! Ow! Ask Glen! He knows everything that goes on in Letterkenny! Get gone, goats! Why, it's a good thing you stepped in when you did, once. I was on the verge of getting rather cross. Boys. Boys. Grab a rake, tidy that gravel you've upset. We need a favor, boys. A big one, boys. What's the matter? Are your Robert Munsch book reports overdue? Thomas' Snowsuit or Moira's Birthday? Angela's Airplanes or Stephanie's Ponytails? Paperbag Princess was the best. Oh, I liked 50 Below Zero. What? Pigs was the best. Oh, no, David's Father. We don't have Robert Munsch book reports overdue. But if I had to pick my favorite, it'd be Mortimer. I'd pick The Boy In The Drawer, but only 'cause somebody probably already picked Love You Forever. Or my personal favorite. I Have to Go! No! This is serious, boys. We had to call off our takedown tourney with Ronsey and Daxie. We got Dycks all over us. Tragic. Those Schmellies are shwarming us, boys. Can we hide out here? Why? Katy, I'll put this gently. All they want to do is bang. They're Bangelina Jolie. We feel like characters in a Bang Lee movie. They need Banger Management. And now you want to hit the Mennopause button? They need more junk than a heroin addict. All they want to do is make pound cake. We're runnin' out of frosting, boys. What's the matter, boys, not enough wood to make the furniture? Boys, the Mennonite has come to the end of the road? They're Olympiclevel polevaulters, buddy. Ruthless on the uneven bar, bro. They're the renegades of spunk. Say jam, sucka. And now you're too tired to go all Mennonight long, Lionel Bitchy? Bonnet blisters on your birds? Tappin' out from tappin'. Bush league. Oh, there is bush. League? Beat it. Katy! Fine. Go up to my room. Thanks, KatyKat. Wait. You've said that before and it was to go bang. And like we said, we definitely have bangovers. But if you. Go. So, you wanna do. You wanna, like, do some sex or. Or. Go! They just parked the Jeep in the driveway. That is a new level of not smart. Should we move it? Nah. How are they ever gonna learn if we don't let 'em crash and burn? Do yous guys thinks that all Mennonites have a hankerings for frequent intimate relations? I'm gonna go ahead and give you the answer I can only assume you're hoping for, Dan. Big time. They are good workers. Fast runners, too. Fuck, can they run! Hello?. Hello. Hello? Hello? Hi, y'all. Sorry to interrupt your worship. Ah, don't be silly, Noah. I was just praying to Jesus's Mother, so the more the Maryer. What is the mat for? Oh, that's just me gettin' in a little exercise while I commune with the Lord. I call it YoGod. Pretty sure it's gonna be a thing. Now, I'm always excited to see a Dyck, but two Dycks at once? My cup runneth over. To what do I owe the pleasure of getting doubleDycked? I, Noah Dyck, am looking for my daughters. They're on their gap year, once, and we are fearful that the hedonistic lifestyle has captured their imaginations. Ugh, preach. I know all about it. You do? Well, of course I do. My parents were both in missionary positions in Africa. So, on my gap year, I ran away and joined an allmale period revue about dolphin poaching, called Master and Baiter. Yelp reviews included, It's fintastic, and, A performance with porpoise. Honest to pod? Noah! Honest to cod. One meanie on Yelp, however, wrote, Will this every dolfinish? But I didn't care because a buddy of mine and I made a blowhole we were both super proud of. Have you seen our Dycks or not? Anita Dyck, full stop. I have not. However, here's a thought. Go to the farm and ask Wayne, because I know if I was a teenage girl, and I'm 80% sure that I am not, that's exactly where I would go to get my gap filled. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Here I stand. Dyckless. Is that the Jeep that belongs to those two sleeveless ne'er do wells? Um. Noah, Anita. As you mentioned previously, we've always been honest with each other. God rewards honesty, once. God is the way, the truth and the life. Those two nut sacs are in the house. Wayne! Katy! If anyone in town was missing a kid or a cat, Nappers'd be the first ones knockin' offering help. It's only right we pay that forward. Do unto others as you would have them do unto. A golden. Wayne's right. Might as well come out, boys. The jig is up. God help you both! Anita Dyck. Anita Dyck. Dycks, please! Now we've all done things in our younger years that we later regrets. What didn't kill us, perhaps it made us stronger. If it was a bad time, maybe it led to a good story. Sometimes even both. But these young fellas was just being young fellas. You can't faults 'em for that. Just like your young gals was just being young gals. Curious. Experimentals. Super bendy. Gumby bendy. That's enough of. Anita Dyck. Anita. Tongues are like Aces, boys, you gotta know when to hold 'em. My point is there's also things we regrets in life that we didn't do. This is one time in my life I don't need a sermon, Daniel. Anita Dyck, let's listen with our heart on our sleeve. For examples, I regrets not telling your sister. She's Lovina Dyck. Yes, no, I know. I know who your sister is. And I regrets not telling your sister, Lovinas Dycks, that I was sweet on her all them years ago. I let my foolish pride gets in my way. Well, Dan, I had no idea. Although, it makes perfect sense. She's a wonderful woman. With a heart as big as her shoulders are broad. But I'm confused, once. What does this have to do with our tiny Dycks? Well, I'm quite sure that your daughters are gonna regret exchanging bodily fluids with these young fellas less than I regrets not letting Lovina Dycks knows I was sweets on her. Wanna know what, Squirrelly D? I'm really rooting for you here. But you can go ahead and summit Mount What's Your Point any time now. So, you likes to drive a hard bargain. Yeah, Nappers are a wee bit sheisty. Here's mine. If you lets this go, I'll bring your gals to ya. I seen 'em ups town not too long ago. But once I bring 'em to ya, you've gots to brings mes to Lovinas Dycks, so we can have a long overdues conversation. And maybe then all of us can gets some closures. Your sister heard an old favorite on the radio the other day. You know what I heard on the radio today who I haven't heard from in a really long time but lowkey love? Radio? Oh, so you were here when I said that then. Which radio? The one in the fuckin' truck. Are you being goofy right now? So, terrestrials radios! All right. Yeah. So you're being goofy right now. No, it's just I don't knows too many peoples who still listens to terrestrials radios. You've ceased mingling with the peasants then, hey, Dan? Internet radios, satellite radios and podcasters is far more populars these days. What do youse listen to? My Favorite Murder podcast. Taggart and Torrens podcast. Stern. Ah, Stern's fuckin' sexy. Most peoples just don't listen to terrestrials radio. Internet radios and satellite radios have become far superior. So, if Howard Stern's type of radio is better than terrestrial radio, would Howard Stern's type be. Extraterrestrial?. Extraterrestrial. Fuck you, Dary. Guess who I heard on terrestrial radio who I haven't heard from in a really long time but lowkey love? Who was it? DMX. Fuckin' A. You like him, too? Sure I do. Why? Well, because he's an animal lover. How do youse knows he's an animal lover? Well, on account of him always barkin' like a dog in his songs. See, that's why I lowkey love him. He just, he sounds so tough when he goes arf, arf at the end of a rap. How's that go, Katy? Arf, arf. I see. So, arf, arf. What the fuck was that? What's the problem? If DMX was here right now, he'd hoof you right in the nuts. I think DMX would assume Dary'd already been hoofed in the nuts. Yeah. I mean, you might as well make a cat sound at the end of a tough guy line. Well, how'd that go, Katy? Meow! No, but put some threatening rap music lyrics in front of it like DMX would. Okay. I'm clickclackin' and rack stackin', bitches know I'm packin', I'm the trillist. Meow! See? I see. It's not the same thing. Nope. No animal sound would have the same effect as a dog barking if you're tryin' to sound tough with rap music lyrics. Not one. Maybe it coulds. Okay, Dan. Dan, okay. Okay, Dan. Let's put it to the test. Ahem. Uh. It's the jumpoff. Rockin' in my Tims. I'm the greatest. Get shook. Baa! Nope. This is America. Put the Benjamin's in the bag, bitch. Hoes in the trap, laid back in the 'Lac, I'm a don.

Original north side gang bangers. Bounce. Real Quick. Moo! Okay. Yes, I understands. I'm a PIMP. Banana clips in the Benz. I'll skeet on your main chick, you little bitch. Baa! Okay, you've made your points. Squeesquee. Ice on my wrist. I'm strappin' and clappin' the glock. I'm about to shoot up your block. Keep it gangster. Okay, that might be enough shouting. Machiavelli. Mom's spaghetti, it's straight yayo all day, yo. I'm the realist. Heehaw! I said you made our point! Gucci bag. Poppin' Dom. Racks on racks on racks, bitch. Make money. Imma shoot on your casket. This is getting obnoxious. Versace, Versace, Versace. Cash money, Uzi's in the back of the Bentley For real though. Ribbit. So you see, Dan? No animal sound is as tough as a dog sound. I'm the king of the jungle, bitch! Bow down!. I'm pretty sure that was a lion he was attempting there. So. So you stand corrected. Okay. Is. Is that okay? I. Just asking. Are you okay? Yep. Just. Just checking. Bye. Don't do that, bud. What? Ask your gal privately, but publicly, Are you okay? Well, I was just making sure. Yeah, you don't wanna get too needy with a gal like that, Dary. A gal like what? A gal who is, respectfully, super, super, super fuckin' hot. She's Victoria Secrets hot, there, good buddys. She's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition hot, Dary. Well, yeah. All the more reason to make sure she's okay. Well, don't say we didn't warn ya. How's the day? Longest day of the year. Summer solsticks. And you know what that means. Century Club! A hundred shots of beer in a hundred minutes will buckle ya if you don't have a strategy. Let me just call the girlfriend and, uh, make sure it's okay with le ol' boule et chaine. Put your phone down, Dary. And fuckin' stomp on it. You try dating a French girl. Yeah, give it a shot, bud. 'Kay. Today on the summer solstice we honor the time good ol' Uncle Eddie got the worst sunburn this side of Sasky, thus having to spend the longest day of the year inside, drinkin' the bar down. Well, I'm not carrying Dan home from the bar this time. That was youse? Well. Who's in? The skids are sober, so they're out. And I don't know, I haven't heard from Reilly and Jonesy. McMurrays? Yeah, they'll be there. Mrs. McMurray tried to arrange some sort of predrink on Facebook. Which is really counterproductive for the Century Club. Also, fuck Facebook. You'll wanna avoid McMurray today. Is that possible? Why? Well, it is the Century Club, so he'll be shitfaced. And when McMurray gets shitfaced, things come out of him that are. Offputting. Like what? No. This one's best left parked. Well, now I'm just super curious. No, just. Just lets sleepin' dogs lies. Yeah, yeah, and don't kick a dead horse. Yeah, stay away from him today. Actually, stay away from him when he's shitfaced any time. You do realize you're driving us straight to him, right? Can confirm. Well, I got the ebrake on so. Better let it out. Can't control a French girl. Or a fuckin' bored one. 'Sup? 'Sup? We'll find out about it anyway. Look, here's the scoop and I'm gonna tell you. When McMurray gets shitfaced, he likes to recount stories from his boys' trips. He still goes on boys' trips and he's married? Grow up. Yeah, he says things that are, mmm. Spit it out. Shoot. Just the worst fuckin' things you've ever heards in your entire lives. This I promise youse. Thank you, Squirrelly Dan. MARIE My brother was a hockey player, all my cousins, too. I grew up with boys. The worst kind. So just try me. Samezies. All right. If we're goin' in, we're goin' in. We ain't stopping till the job's done. I should've packed a lunch for this. And final warning, this one is best left unpacked. Once we start you're gonna want us to stop. But we're not gonna stop. Prove it. You guys should do it in your McMurray's voice. Also keep your jaws clenched like he does when he's all shitfaced. You know, for its effects. Any time now. Buckles up. Wayne, how would youse like to talk about cunt? Hey, Dary, are you an ass man, a tits man, or a cunt man? Hey, you ever fucked a couple of tasties at the same time? Oh. Fucked so many tasties. They used to tell me, Hey, you wanna taste it? They used to say, Come on, big boy, wanna jam a little bit of a taste? I go down to Vegas with about 17 buddies every single year and you never seen so much cunt in your life. Ew! Hard Rock rooftop, poolside villas. I ain't never seen so much cunt in my life. Anybody tell ya they seen more cunt then that's a liar! I used to fuck so many tasties. Where is Mrs. McMurray in all this? We's don't ask those kinds of questions. I'll tell ya, the last time we were down there, we made a little hashtag so the boys could keep track of each other. Why don't you go ahead and search hashtag MashTheGash2018. The year before it was hashtag SlitSlam2017. Oh. They were just the tastiest little slits you've ever seen. You never seen a gash so tasty. You know what, Bobby, Jim Dandy, you're gonna lose a digit in that sort of snapper. Let me tell you something, Vegas, Hard Rock rooftop, poolside villas, that cunt's there for the money and the money's there for the cunt. Oui. Yous guys had that comin', good buddies. That's a keeper if there ever was one, eh, good buddy?. Katy? But the McMurray's are part of the lifestyle so don't they just do that kind of shit together? I mean, they seem so in love. Different strokes for different folks, Miss Katys. I don't think Mrs. McMurray knows about this. It's none of our beeswax, Miss Katy. And she oughtta. That's none of your beeswax, Miss Katy. What are you trying to say to me right now? I'm sorry, Miss Katys. Apples. How's the take down tally, gents? Almost at the finish line. Let's sprint, baby, you know I want it. Speaking of Finnish, I smashed a FinnishJordanian a few nights ago. Exquisite. I smashed a TonganMicmac just this morning. Yeah, I smashed a CatalanCameroonian. Yeah? I smashed a SwedishWest Indian. Good. Well I smashed an Interior SalishThaiSyrian. Okay. Ever smashed an East TimoresePapua New Guinean? No. Ever smashed a HonduranEmiratisMetis?

Let's all take a piss and get fuckin' some Nepalese Maritimers. Oh. Ow. Ronsey? Daxy. Hurt a bit when you pee? It burns, buddy. Jonesy? Reilly. It burns when I pee, buddy. It was that HaitianBangladeshi.  That Baja DesertUkrainian. It had to have been that Northern IrishMaori tribesman. It was that Saint LucianSikh separatist. Fuck! Oh, Katy. You better tuck in that bottom lip before ol' Tweety Bird comes along and makes a poopy poop on it. Glen, I will. Katy. Get a drink. Can I get a drink? Oh, no, no, Katy. Yell at me today. Because today I'm playing the role of Gail the bartender so that she may binge drink with all y'all, which is technically a form of alcoholism. It's gonna be a great day. Not for hay. Not today. Today we's stays. Inside? Fuck's sake. You're gonna fuck it up, bud. Meanwhile, hello there. Who's this nice little number, Wayne? She's like a. Like a little Cathy Deneuve or like a little Brigitte Bardot. Glen, this MarieFred. Oh. Enchante, MarieFred. Je m'appelle all fucking yours. I know what you mean, Gail. She's like a. Like a Juliet Binoche. Like a Marion Cotillard. I'm here with Wayne. Who? Wayne. I don't fuckin' know him. Yeah, you do. But I know you. Not yet. Soon. Oh, lads, just a little FYI reminder.

Rules are no pissin', no passsin' out and especially no pukin'. Ugh! No pukin', please! Ewweeyouwee, gross, gross! It's a carpet in here. Competition's slim this year. The skids are sober. Reilly and Jonesy called in sick. So, you've got a shot. One hundred shots to bes precise. Oh, Dan! Well, I'd have a beer. Katy have a beer? I need a beer. MarieFred, have a beer? I'd have a beer. Dan, have a beer? I'd have a beer. Dary, have a beer? You okay? Fuck sake. I'll grab them. This time, yes, but next time, talk to old Glen. Say, Glen, get me some beers. Because technically today I'm takin' over the bar for Gail. We know. Okay. I'm starting to hear, I'm sayin' it a lot and I'm being really detailed. You comin'? Thought I'd concealed it. Let's go. Oh, mercy. Bonnie, get the hot compress ready for Gail! She is some special, Wayne. She's like a little Genevieve Bujold. Or like a little MarieJosee Croze. Yep, a keeper if there ever was one, bud. Just makin' sure. Oh, Daryl. You're a bit of a tragedy today, aren't ya? A needy boy is a seedy boy. Okay? You're gonna fudge this up, buddy. I don't know why she's being so distant. Well. Take a look in the mirror you fuckin' asshole! Wayne! How's the good 'n' you bad are you now?. You're hammered. McMurray. Here they are. Well, I might've had a helpin' hand from a spicy little number by the name of Mrs. Pampered Puss McMurray. Hoo, boy! MRS. I'll tell you what. I might have a little base coat of ginski in this cocksucker. Mayfair. The good stuff. Hey, Gail! How are we doin' for ginski in this cocksucker? You got the Piger Henricus from. Quebec?. I got a Wendigo if you want a Quebec gin. Awesome. Ginski. Oh, heavens. Okay? Next time ask me 'cause I'm in charge of the bar today. I am a lucky man. Well, now that the sitdown pissers are trampin' off to the bar, youse guys wanna talk about cunt?. What a pain in the ass, eh, Ronsey?. I'd call it a pain in the dick, Daxy. Pain in the ass? Pain in the dick? REILLY AND. This is the end of days. Oh, relax, boys. At least it's not the gift that keeps on giving. Yeah, boys. Could've been the herpdog. How can you be so cold about this? It's your manhood, boys. Doesn't it just level you to see it like that? This isn't your. This is! DAX AND. Your first STD! Adorable. Wait. This. This isn't yours? DAX AND. No! How many have you had? That's a tough question. I don't even know. Oh, my God, is that bad? Oh, my God, is it? I'm more trying to think of a time when I didn't have one. Twowenty? Thirty? You're in the ballpark. I think? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, you're terrible. You're terrible. How the fuck can you be so calm about this? This is the end of days! REILLY AND.  This is the end of days! I think we learned a lesson here, buddy. I think so too, buddy. Which is odd because we're normally all about the antilesson, buddy. Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose type thing. Yeah, it was coming to us, bro. When we compete to take down babes. And nearly win. Still could win. But. Really. No one wins. It was that HimlayanBengaliCroat. That rascal!  The rungs of me be under under you Translated. You're havin'. Dary? Brehfekst. Atta boy. .with your pals the other day. You wearin' perfume, bud? Perfumes is for womens, good buddy. He's wearin's the cologne. It's actually an eau de toilette. Eau de toilet. Eau de dewdahday. What's the difference? Well, a cologne is about seven's percent's aromatic essence that dissolves in alcohols. Whereas an eau de toilette is 10% aromatics essences. There you go. An eau de toilette like this will evaporate from your skin pretty rapidly. So, you're gonna wanna load up on it. You could still take a good 23 to 27% off'er, bud. You never wears too much perfumes, Miss Katy's. And that's what I appreciate's about you's. Let's not. This eau de toilette is enchantingly refreshing on summer days like this. That may the softest thing you've ever said, Dary. No, it isn't. What is? I can't stand harsh metals against my skin. They give me a rash. Oh, I love's pancakes. Thank you, ladies. These are actually crepes. Pancakes with a French spin. What's the difference? Pancake batter has a rising agent in it. Baking powder. There you go. It makes them thick and fluffy. Crepe batter doesn't have a rising agent in it, so they're thinner. Chch. All's I know is that these would be great with some Elmira's maple syrup. You's two's could open up a crepe shop with these. Wanna know what? I already told her that. We call it, Planet of the Crepes. Crepe Canaveral. The Crepe Crusader. Crepe Winslett's. Do the Carpets Match the Crepes? The Crepe of Things. Date Crepe. I don't know about that one. It's Crepes on a Date. Get your mind outta the gutter. The Great EsCrepe. Crepe Fear. Sex, Lies and Video Crepe. Sadako and the Thousand Paper Crepes. Great book. It's actually pronounced krep. Yeah, you guys kind of butcher our language. Well, to be fair. To be fairah. To be fair. To be fairah. To be fairah. there's folks in France who think you's guys butcher your language. So. Ooh! Who gives a crepe! Wanna know what? There's pretty good ones for krep as well. Johnny Crepe. Holy Crepe. Total ECrepes of the Heart. Crepe Up, starring Channing Tatum. Crepe Up. The Streets. Crepe Le Pew. Le Creppaneur. I'd have a CrepsiCola. Rips, Crepes, Revelations! Crepititis. Oh, jeez, I don't knows about that one. Will you get off my dick today? Led Creppelin. You know, if I keeping eatin' all these crepes. I might get a crepe worm. Like a. it's like. it's like a tapeworm, but it's having the. No. Nope. Wish you weren't so fuckin' awkward, bud. Breakfast. Atta boy. 'lo? Oh, it's Stewart! He's in trouble. Who was that? Skid. Hello. It's Stewart! He's in tr. Who was that? Skid. Ahoy, hoy. Stewart's in trouble! Call me first, next time. He's deh. Isn't he sober now? Yeah, but he. he's. he's. he's. Slow down. He's. he's. he's. Breathe, Roaldy. Healing? Dealing! Dealing? Shocker. Yeah. There's another deh. and he. and he said he's gonna kill him. Okay. Well, stop dehhealing and come home. He won't. he won't! Why not? Because he's a vigi. he's a vigilante! Fuck sakes. Okay. We're coming. No. yeah. No, we're not. Yes, we are. No, we're not. Yes, we are. No, we're not. Dan, get off my dick today. Sorry, Miss Katy's. What's the problem, Wayne? You don't wanna go to the SPCA and play with the dogs? Oh! What's the matter, Dary? You don't wanna go to the food court in the mall and get a little of everything to create the perfect meal? Oh! And Dan, if, you get off my dick, we'll play Big Buck Hunter HD 42inch wild in one of the Donnelly bars. Robin Hood. pop culture's most beloved vigilante. Boisterous. Rebellious. Unstoppable. Just like me. Katy and the hicks are coming here and they're gonna take us home. Noah! Yesah! Noah! Yesah! No what? He said, Nowah! We keep drugs safe. It's not supposed to be safe. It's drugs! You don't relish being a vigilante, Roald? This is the third note stuck to the door this week! Mmm. The grammar's atrocious. Exceptionally odious. That's what makes it scary. They're too hardcore to proofread. Hard corny. You're so fuckin' funny. If they don't take the edifice of their letter seriously, why would I take their threat seriously? One mistake is enough for you to ignore the angel of death? Two. Two? Two mistakes! In two sentences. Your, versus, you're, youapostrophe re, is so fucking basic it's embarrassing. If you want to say, You are dead, which this fucking boob has cheaply attempted, then you'd want use. you're. Where is the other mistake? Omission of the word of. Oh, that may have been an intentional omission. Sure, Roald. He's a man of exorbitantly few words. So, my reply. Your threat is meaningless. Ooh! Got good hands. (GASPS, SQUEAKS) Stick that on the door! Roald, I would like to speak with Stewart privately. Oh. Ow! Again! Dream notch on the bedpost, boys. Go. Dead or alive? Either. Go. Terry Fox. Good one. Great one. Do you know how much ass Terry Fox would get if he was still alive? He could start with mine. Ronzy. Go. Gretz. God. Good one. The great one. Reilly. Go. Gretz. Get out. Paulina. Gotcha. Get it. Jonesy. Go. Grande. Ariana. Graceful. Glorious. Gracias. Ariana Grande looks like she's eight, titfucker. I'm givin' the preschool your plate numbers. Shoresy? And Gretz's daughter's a married woman, you classless piece of shit. She wouldn't fuck you if you had Mario's dangles and Messier's dick. Fuck you, Shoresy! Fuck you, Daxi. You wouldn't know what to do with the great one. He fires bigger rockets than Elon Musk. Oh, fuck you, MaryAnne. Fuck you, Ronzy. You're a marathon of dope. Terry Fox ran 3400 miles in a 143 days on one leg. If he were alive, he'd be gettin' handy's from Hiltons and Hadids. Fuck you, BettyAnne. If Terry Fox was alive, Gisele would be sliding into his DM's from Patriots' games. Fuck you, MaryAnne! If Terry Fox ran 143 days he smashed 143 broads and that's probably fuckin' light. Fuck you, Shoresy. If Terry Fox was alive he'd have an interview show like Seinfeld. You mean, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee? Yeah. But it'd be called Canadians in Cars Getting Blow's. MARY If Terry Fox was alive he'd be smashing JLaw and JLo on ScarJo's boat. He'd be boatin' with Kylie Minogue. Let's get some fuckin' gyozas. Fuck you, Shoresy! Gimme a high five. Oh, gimme a high five right there. The city is not looking so bad right about now, eh, big brother. Know what? I'm just happy to be alive after sharing the expressway with city drivers. Boy, howdy. Did you ever notice that every time you go to merge, there just happens to be six inbreds merging at the exact same time? Come off the ramp, get your fuckin' foot in it. Yeah. And then ya got the wannabe Indie car drivers who have it right to the rug who kinda fly's up behind you and kiss bumpers. Like, what's your hurry's there Jimmy Hinchcliffe's? Greg Moore was the greatest. Oh, yeah, he was the fuckin' greatest. What's their hurry? They've got a fuckin' brunch line to go wait in. All right, well, what's the scoop here, KatyCat? We gonna go find Stewart or what? Well, now hold on one fiscal minute here, Wayne. Pizza, fries, sushis, Yogen Fruz. I thought we were going to the food court. Of course we are, Dary. Szechuan, shawarma, stir fries, Five Guys. We can't forgets about Colonels Cajun BBQs and DQs. Well, there's no way we're missing Tacos and Quiznos, Chipotle and ChickfilA. Wayne, we're meetin' the skids at the club at around midnight. That's still a good six calendar hours away, Katy. Simmer down. Yeah, but I still have to go find something to wear. Show these city girls what's up. All right. Let's split. You wanna know what? It's always so tough sayin' bye to the puppies. Like they're so cute you almost don't want to. That may be the softest thing you've ever said, big brother. No, it isn't. What is? How come no one ever compliments me on my eyelashes? You're paraphrasing. You fuckin' know it! Is that what I'm doin'? What I said was, I got real long eyelashes. But I'm surprised no one's ever noticed that. Gimme a high five. high five. Gae? Roaldy. Look! Oh, this is so agitating. I know. I'm frightened. I'm referring to the spelling and the grammar, Roald. Gives me the coldest pricklies. What have those wordsmiths assembled for us this segment?. How asinine! They can kiss my asinine. Oh, that ass is mine. I'm frightened! Yet another demeaning attempt to intimidate. And this one even better. Yeah. I'm pushing the panic button here, you guysers. Don't be such a jellyfish, Roald! My slowlearning, sevenyearold brother even knows it's, If you're. you apostrophe re, there. there tonight. Comma. No period. It's It apostrophe s. on. Period. I'd have chosen an exclamation point. I think you're right. Past notes haven't quite landed. Do you know what I mean? Yes, sans duress. They don't exactly have the tiger by the tail, do they? Not exactly whipping the excitement up to a real fever pitch. No. They are not. For a plethora of reasons. This death note, presumably the final installment, it requires urgency. Some sort of accent, I would agree. The exclamation point guides the reader to approach it more threateningly. Like, there's stakes there. Like, It's on! Right? Exactly. As opposed to a period. Because, if it's me. It's you. I read it like. It's on. The period leaves the decision up to the reader. It does suggest a more docile read. There's no room for ambiguity in death threats. Exclamation point? Yes. Sexclamation point. Oh. Go stick that on the door! Alleyyoop. Okay. Let's clean this shit up and go back in. I need to find something to wear tonight. Get my hussy on. Give me five calendar minutes to digest, and I'll join ya. Oh, so you're looking to find a nice bench to have a sit down outside a lingerie store, Dary? I'd be looking for a sit down, won't be no bench though. Be the throne then, Dary? Porcelain one. Can confirm. You should have a sits down in a public washrooms? Surprised I'm not having a sit down in a public washroom right now. You's would do such a thing's? Faster than Greg fuckin' Moore. How could ya, Dary? How could you do such a thing's? Public washrooms is disgusting. Poo particles is literally's airborne's. Oh, ceased mingling with the peasants again now, have we, Dan. Won't find a more violent environments on the planet Earth. Not for my money. Not for my money either. Oh, how's the weather up there in your ivory tower, Wayne? Well, I'll go in, just won't have a sitdown. I'll rock one, like a good old boy. Not a monster. Must be nice to have the option. Well, I just get the giggles is all. Ain't nothin' to giggle about in a cesspool of fecal matters and peepees. Sure there is. What? Well. farts. Ew. Well, there's nothin' funnier than a fart. Except kids fallin' off bikes maybe. Fuck, I could watch kids fall off bikes all fiscal day. I don't give a shit about your kids. Oh, yeah, it's super funny. You just be standing there, rocking a piss, dude will come up next to you. Just rip a fart. How is that funny? Dude droppin' his guts like that? I take's exceptions to it. Well, you're supposed to be standing there, nobody'll say nothing, you'll be rockin' one, peacefully. Then you just rip a fart. It's not funny's. It's fuckin' hilarious. What is your guys fascination with farts? Well, you don't know him. He doesn't know you. He ain't never heard one like that before. Yeah, farts will never not be funny. I will never not laugh at a fart. There's even a courtesy aspect of it, too. Ah, this should be interesting. Well, like if you go into a public bathroom, there's a guy in a stall, he'll announce his presence to you. Like how? He's sittin' there and maybe he'll clear his throat. Like. That's exactly how they do it, Dary. They go. Why would he want to announce that he's having a sit down? Well, the first sound you hear is not a fart. He's prepping you for the acoustics. And how is that courteous? Well, let's say you're like me, you get the giggles. From a fart? I get the giggles from a fart, yes. You're in there, you're at the urinal, you hear a fart, you giggle a wee bit. Get shaking. Piss goes everywhere. How do you think the pee's particles gets airborne's?. It's weird, 'cause dudes will fart in front of each other any day of the week. Soon as you get into a public stall, want to announce their presence. Make sure one doesn't sneak up on ya. But it's a public bathroom. You're supposed to hear those sorts of sounds. It's just different in there, Katy. It's more intimate. Come off it. Some dudes want to announce themselves by sniffing, which is not the right avenue. Ain't nothin' in there you wanna be sniffin'. No, I'm gonna tell ya. All right, come on, Dary. Let's go. You guys should make some betters efforts to avoid bacteria's exposures. Good hygiene is the only jeans that never goes out of styles. Dan, I think that might be the softest thing you've ever said. No, it isn't. What is? Okay. One time my perennials didn't come in for the second year, and you knows perennials is exposed to live more than two years. So, I says, I'm so upset about my perennials.. Yikes. Dary. Oy! Oh, girls! We can help with this. We don't want these dudes in the club either. Thanks, but some hicks are coming from Letterkenny and they're taking us home. Good luck getting him away from that. Sounds like some of that good fuckin'. Mmm. Mmmhmm. There may be animals being harmed in there. Listen to me. Some hicks from Letterkenny aren't gonna do it. These dudes roll deep. Take this shit seriously. You're keeping us safe. Even though it's not supposed to be safe 'cause it's drugs. And we appreciate it. But you're dealing on their turf. They're not gonna stop 'til you're off it. One way or another. They do not care. Look at their spelling. Dangerous grammar. Dangerous. That's what I said. Oh, my god, it's so big, Stewart! Mmm. Hmm. So, how's the take down tally, boys? Yeah, boys. How's the tail town? Undressin' and progressin' boys. Workin' smarter, not harder. You know what I'm talking about. Yeah. How's the titty tally on your end, boys. Suckin' some yayas? Come on, I get off on it. Yeah, you handlin' some knocks? Took down an AustralAsian just last week. How exotic. Smashed an IndoLaotian two nights ago. Festive. I know. Ever smashed an ArcticKuwaiti? No. Ever smashed an EcuadorianAlbanian? 'Course. Ever smashed a Sierra LeoneanSaudi? No. Ever smashed a Sri Lankan French citizen? Several. You ever smashed a UruguayanIsraeli? What? How about a CroatianQuebecer. Likely. You ever smashed a TibetanNew Zealander? No. How about a MoroccanHong Konger? No. Ever smashed a CubanUzbek? Come on. You ever smashed a MalteseCongolese? Boys, I think that's a dog. You ever smashed a BalticGermanSpaniard? That's for sure a dog, buddy. How about a BalticRussianIraqi? You've for sure smashed a PeruvianTurk. Everyone has. Same way everyone's smashed a WelshNigerian. Gimme a SwedishPhilipinno for dinner. And a GuatemalanSlovak for dessert. Ah. Gimme a TamilBritish Virgin Islander, Ronzy. Gimme a KosovarGreenlander, Daxi. I'm gonna gobble him all up. We could be in trouble in this takedown tourney, buddy. Gimme a QatariMontenegrin, Ronzy. Gimme a St. LucianLuxembourger, Daxi. I think we're in trouble, buddy. I'm gonna fuck a DutchAfghan! I'm fuckin' a Falkland IslandSerb! I'm gonna fuck a SomaliChinese Mainlander! I'm gonna fuck an IslamicSpartan!. This is IslamicSparta! Um, that was pretty fuckin' serious. That was pretty fuckin' serious. Bringin' weapons to a street fight. Strike five fuckin' million against the city. And a lot of them condo buildings just looks like human storages to me. Pretty fuckin' serious, skid? Mortally fuckin' serious, hick. It's time to come home, Stewart. Can we leave now? No! Train ain't comin' back, buds. Stewart? I said noah! Stewart, we gotta lay low for a while. What about. You go your way. I'll go another. It's best we split up. What about the. Just.just for now. I know what comes next. Stewart. Gae. Stewart? Roald! Why do you rebel? I hate my parents. And? I hate the world. And. I hate myself. Get this guy a fuckin' Puppers. It's not going anywhere any time soon. No. We'll rebel again. All right, we need to split too. Um, Miss Katy's? What? Was I's able's to successfully's. Stay off my dick today, Dan? Yes. And yes, you may. Gimme competition! You know what? It's better with an even number. A fuckin' crossfitter gave ya the stinkeye flippin' tires down the street trying to look hard. Buddy, you're softer than a Cinnabon sampler. You kiss your friend's older sister once who who tastes like Fisherman's Friends then you better do horn to that memory ever since. You woke up with your horn looking out the window but you gotta be at work in 20. So it's now or never. Well, I should say. We're all excited that the Leafs are doing betters and all's. But if they think's you're payin' a bucktwenty for upper bowl seats, they can suck my babcock. You ripped a game of Buck Hunter so fuckin' immaculate that bar has brought you in through the kitchen ever since. Your gal likes goin' for long drives, chitchattin' around town like gas ain't a buckforty. With zero regard for the amount of lawns you gotta mow to fill the cocksucker. Your pal squeezed into the same section of a revolving door behind you one time and you're still pals. But, like, you're not about to sit beside him at a fuckin' campfire. Jivin' Pete says his new gal looks like a young Shania Twain and you just don't have the Timbits to tell him that she looks more like Post Malone's fucked Dion Phaneuf's. You know it's titsup for your ball team when the opposing pitcher's got arms so big, he could throw a cotton ball over a barn. You knew your pal had come into money when he started throwing out perfectly good pistachios, like he was above cranking 'em open with a box cutter like the rest of us. You're pretty sweet on your new gal, but if she forgets to close the third door of your truck before the passenger door one more time, it's fuckin' over. I've had it. You caught a whiff of a gals that smelled like campfire smokes and that shit's got ya stiff as a weekold Slim Jims. Your friend's dad gets so mad sometimes, he hollers fuck, but doesn't pronounce the CK at the end, he's so squirrelly. So it sounds more like fu! Fu! Fu! Fu! And I think that's pretty fuckin' funny. You guys drink too much. Said buddy with the bloody nose from hooverin' shneef off a sandy beach towel. So, what have you's been up to? Rap game! I'm Fire Marshall Mathers. Oh, let's hear it.  Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Got the streets a bubblin'. Where's Stewart? Your pal added comic relief to your sister catching a line drive in the womanhood at softball by sayin'. Right in the twiffer! Still not laughing. Twiffer! It's a bad look if I'm not smokin' hot. At least I'm smokin' pot. You can say with confidence, the hockey players are still a couple of dumb fucks, because now after a goal they go holler. He shoots, he sca. He shoots, he sca. So there that is. Crosby sca. McDavid sca. Any more wisdoms while we gotchas? Yes. A, B, C, Always Be Lifting! Also, road games. Sometimes, there are two buddies to a room, but there's only one bed. Golden rule, you can sleep pole to pole. And hole to hole. But, you can't sleep. Pole to hole. You put the dumb in wisdumb, don't ya's? You and your sister were bickering. We spat about, I don't know what. When she said. I could argue till the cows come home. She pointed at 'em in the yard, out the kitchen windows. Fuck, let's not let supper get cold. Twiffer. Still not laughing. Fuckin' inbreds. Inbred hot chili peppers. Washington Inbredskins. Cincinnati Inbreds. Inbred Riding Hood. Inbred Lobster? Can we get this rig rolling? Inbredy, set, go. Thanks for making the trip this weekend. Thanks for making the trip last weekend. Look forward to the trip next weekend. You remember McMurray, eh? Don't think he'd let me forget him if I wanted to. Let me, uh. Let me bend your ear on something. Here. Could have guessed. Um. You were gonna bend my ear? She was being a bit of a cow, eh? So anywho, McMurray told me that he was at the airport one time and he seen a dude in the washroom at the urinal. And he was working his iPad while he. Pissed? Rocked one, yeah. You can say it. Just don't make a habit of it. Texassized 104. The dude was at the airport with his iPad on top of the urinal and he was working on it while he rocked one? Can confirm. What could be so urgent? That's what I said. I said, What could be so urgent? Then I said, Like, who is this nut sac? Or who does this nut sac think he is? Here's the thing that I'm going to tell you. Now, I've really come land, sea, and air at this. 'Kay. .over time. There's only thing that could be so urgent. Checkin' in for his flight? Hard no. Uh, a lot of airlines overbook their flights anticipating noshows. And if you don't check in you're hooped. But still, to be at the airport, at the urinal, on your iPad, with your. Dick out? Your horn, yeah. Dick. Won't make a habit of it. To be at the airport, at the urinal, on your iPad, with your dick out, there's got to be more at stake than a missed flight. Have you ever missed a flight? No. Me neither. 'Kay. Bet it sucks, though. Still, airport, iPad, urinal, dick out. Like let's get real here. You get real. You get real. The dude's important. Or he's got someone really important to answer to, if his iPad work couldn't wait till after he rocked one. Big time. What's he putting into the iPad is what I want to know. L'il help? L'il help. Wanna know what he's puttin' in the iPad? I can tell you what he's putting in the iPad. Here's what he's putting into the iPad. The codes. The codes? Those codes. That's a thing that could be so urgent. That's the one thing that could be so urgent. What a goof. To be at the airport at the urinal, with your iPad, your dick out. Silly. This nut sac is one in a chain of commanding political figures with access to the codes to green light a nuclear strike. That's who he is. And he had to get his portion of the codes in immediately, so that the warheads could take flight. Why's he firing a warhead? Well, someone would have had to fire a warhead first, right? You know, if I'm that dude at the airport, with my dick out, working on my iPad, I mean, the whole fuckin' world's at stake. There's multiple warheads? Both sides would have to have warheads in the air or projectiles, if it's nuclear war, yes. Those are some stakes. What else could be so urgent? Not much else could be so urgent. So the other three in the political chain of command had already entered their portion of the codes and they just needed, we'll call him Gary, to enter his portion of the codes. Hmm. What? Wonder how Gary's working it? What are we talking about here, the iPad or the. Or. Both. Both? Curious as to whether he had one hand on his horn and one on the iPad. Because if he's pissing handsfree, then he'd get the codes typed in much faster. Oh, way faster. At least twice as fast. Yeah, and he's in a hurry for sure, 'cause of the codes. Yeah. JeanClaude. JeanLance. JeanClaude. JeanLance. Go sit down and drink your beer. What if I don't? Well, then I'd have to put my beer down. You's got's a semi. Yep, don't lay down for a nap on the couch without's a pillow for your lap. Probably didn't want me walkin' in here seeing you all halftorqued like that. Nope. Probably no fun for the dog to have to climb over your thicksie's just to give you a kiss in the face. All right. Come on, girl, why don't we go? Let's leave the halfblood prince to his little sleeps. Good nap? Great nap. Nap with me? Well, I just kind of had a nap. Then we don't need to sleep. Okay. Sure we can't convince you guys to sign with the summer squad? I got a pen you can borrow. You know the one. Take my writing utensil. We got a big hole at the center and it needs to be filled. Back end's tight, but we need to be deeper up front. Let's talk depth. Show you a thing or two. Join our energy line. Keep those fuckin' feet moving. I'm so fuckin' serious right now. Daxi. Ronsy. How about all the tail around here, boys? Late June rush at the gymski. It's all the college and uni kids home for the summer. Home to work their summer jobs. I got a job you can work. Let's fuckin' do it. The gettin's gonna be good for a couple of months ferda. Summer's the goodest time for gettin' and the gettin's about to get got, get it? Got it. Good. But what say we make it interesting? Oh, it's already interesting. Jesus. I'll say, boys. I'll say, I could jerk off right here. I swear to fuckin' God. But tell me, are you two looking to fall in love or just fall in the sack? Buddy. Sack. Thought so. Think you can fall in more times than us? Fall in the sack? Yeah. With girls? Duh. Like can we take down more babes than you? Can you take down more babes than we can take down dudes? I'm gonna jerk off right here, I swear to fuckin' Christ. Buddy, no contest. Save your money, boys. Are. Are you guys like married though? We just wanted to buy a house. Tax breaks there. We still smash all sorts of ass. Never smashed so much ass in my life. Cool. Cool. So fuckin' cool. But you're confident you smash more? Girls? Duh. Absolutely. First of all, there aren't that many gay dudes in Letterkenny. You'd be surprised. Small town kids going to school in the big city? Out of the small town, out of the closet, boys. Mmm. And second, we get like. Take downs. Sometimes, wake up in the morning and it's just like, start having a take down. There's been like a handful of times, actually, where I have to take a good look in the mirror about take downs. Sometimes, during the middle of a take down thoughts creep in. So, we got a deal? Yeah, deal, totally. Cool. Our total takedown tally versus your total takedown tally. Deal. What do the winners get? Case of beer? Case of beer. Love a case of beer. Deal. Case of beer. Here's to the opening gay ceremonies, boys. Boys in for the ceremonial fuck drop. I know a good horn section for the event. Why don't ya give it a little toot? Come on, give it a little blast. I'm gonna have sex with some girls!. Ferda! Bonnie. Wayne. Hi there. Hi, dare. I'll have the pinot noir, please. Is that what you'll take, then? Not a good look, Bonnie. Beer? Please and thank you. She was being a bit of a cow, eh? That's McMurray's sister. She comes by it honestly. She's pretty. Oh, she's a lovely girl, for the most part. So much petty hostility between English and French. Yeah, it's a bit obnoxious, isn't it? I'm glad we agree on that. As long as we can also agree that French toast is a waste of time. So are English muffins. There ya go. I was thinking about the dude McMurray saw at the airport. There's a lot to unpack there, eh? You're Gary. Mmmhmm. You're one of the four. Mmmhmm. Your secretary calls and says the country needs the codes. It wouldn't be a secretary. Eh? It'd be one of the other three. I think you're right. I'm for sure right. The other three wouldn't likely trust Gary's secretary with news of incoming projectiles. MarieFred, you don't trust the fuckin' secretary with the projectiles. The secretary wouldn't have been sworn in like the other government officials. Who knows who the secretary's working for? Secretary could be workin' for anybody. There'd be protocol in place. It would be in writing. That information would be so classified. You know how classified that information would be? Super classified? One tier up. It'd be ultra classified. Do you wanna know what? I'm just gonna come right out and say it here. If I'm one of the four, I get that information from the horse's mouth or you're not getting the codes. Wanna take about 20% off? Yeah, I'd take about 20% off 'er. So, you're Gary. Mmmhmm. One of the other three commanding government officials says, We need the codes. Stat. Mmmhmm. Mmmhmm. This is it, Gary. Nuclear war! Jesus Christ, it's nuclear war. What do you do? I'd piss myself. Bingo. I'd have to go, at the very least. Of course, you would. I don't know if I'd be able to hold it. But I'd be sayin', Whoa. You'd better fuckin' hold onto her. It's an appropriate physical response to news of incoming warheads. It'd be alarming. But let's not forget, you're Gary. Yeah. Yeah. You've got responsibilities if you're Gary. You've got the codes. Whole country's counting on you if you're Gary. Women and children, the elderly. So, you're Gary, you get the call for the codes. You say holy shit. You'd say holy shit. I'm gonna piss myself. But it's nuclear war. And despite nuclear war, all this at stake, Gary's still pissing while he puts in the codes. You wanna know what? What? The washroom had to have been right there. It had to have been right there. He might already have been in the washroom. I think he was already in there. You're Gary, you're in the washroom, you get the call, need the codes. I'm gonna piss myself. And he got his iPad out as fast as he got his dick out? He was for sure already in the washroom. Might've already been on the iPad. Well, that solves it! It was a convenience thing then. You're Gary, you're in the washroom, you get the call, need the codes. Well, I can get you the codes, but I'm gonna piss myself. And he got the codes in, but didn't piss himself because. Because he was already in the washroom. Jesus Christ, the world could use a couple of more Garys. I think we've sleuthed it out, partner. Bless ya for tryin' on sleuth, but, uh, yeah, I think we have sleuthed it out, partner. How's your French coming? Well. The only thing is. We'd know if there was a nuclear strike that was intercepted. Like, it'd be in the news. Ah, come on. That many projectiles in the air? Let's get real here. Warheads or not, we'd know about it. Like, we'd know it happened. Yeah. The government wouldn't want us to know, but someone would leak it. I'm looking at the secretary. Beer for you, Wayne. Thank you, Bonnie. And da pinot noir for 'er. Ew. Too French. Bonnie. Why don't you go sit down and drink your wine? What if I don't?. Den I'd have to put my wine down. It's bush party season, boys. 'Tis the season. Seasons greetings. You know, I'm gonna make some Caesars with the girls and get geared up for a gooder. Oh, I'd have a Caesar. You can't really see a Caesar and not want a Caesar. That's actually how they market Caesars. Wayne? Dary. Can I bend your ear about something? What are you, a bender? Good one. Heard it from a cow. I know it's impolite to kiss and tell, but. I wouldn't say that's universal, but, okay. Between us girls. Yeah, between us girls. You ever thrown so much hip in your life? Between us girls? Yeah. Between us girls. I've never thrown so much hip in my life. How much hip we talking? I'm talkin' like I'll be halfway through a bowl of cereal and. Hip. Oh, yeah. Oh, man. Same for you? Oh, yeah. Is that right? Between us girls? Of course, between us girls. I feel like we met, I punched in and I haven't punched out. Can I ask you something? Of course, good buddy. You feel like you're gettin' any better at it? I feel like I'm gettin' a lot better at it. Me too. And I kind of feel like I was a bit of a novice with the whole thing before. I feel that way, too. I feel like with some of the gals I'd done some yessin' with in the past, they might have thought, This guy's a dabbler. Dary, that's exactly how I feel. Like, I feel like they might have seen me as a hopeful, at the very least. Or like, maybe I was just apprenticing at the time. I kind of feel like I might be a bit of a headliner now. Really? Oh, yeah. What are we talking, like large theaters or stadiums? Well, large theaters for the time being. But like, if you can keep going at the rate you're going, you'll be destined for, like. Bigger venues. Yeah. That's exactly how I feel. That's how I feel, too. MARIE Who wants a Caesar? Oh, I'd have a Caesar. Can't see a Caesar and not want a Caesar. That's actually how they market Caesars. Is Stewart gonna DJ this bush party? Wanna know what? I haven't seen that fuckin' nut sac in the longest time. I wonder where he's off to.
