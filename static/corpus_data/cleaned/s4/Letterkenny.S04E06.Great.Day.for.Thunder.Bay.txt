You were trying to figure out WTF. with your BFFs the other day. You guys ever sexted? No All the times. Do you really? Daily. I'm a bit surprised at you, Squirrely Dan. It's all above water, I assure's you. I'm on a telephone application's called Bumble. It's kind of like Tinder except only the women's can initiate conversations. So, what, they just message you up on your telephone to sex talk? Sex text. Correct. Terrific. I think I've been sexting with a gal, but not too sure. Well, what did she sext ya? LOL. What did you sext her directly before that? Well, I asked her if she wanted to go on a date. That's not sexting. Sure's it is. No, it isn't. Dary asked a gal to go on the date and she texted back LOL's. Yes, so it appears as though that's what went down, Squirrely Dan. Well, that means, Lots of love. No it doesn't. Sure's it does. No it doesn't. LOL means, Laughing out loud. So? So one of two things, super chief. Number A, she thinks the very thought of going on a date with you is laughable. Or number B, the fact that you'd think she'd want to go on a date with you is laughable. Either way you're hooped. So? So she's laughing at you, bud. So it's.not sexting? Figure it out. Maybe she meant, Lots of load. You wanna know what? That's the problem with sexting and texting or technology in general. The world needs less Facebook and more facetoface. More than a bit fuckin' embarrassing, we're all sitting around here trying decipher what three letters might mean. I'm sensing a bit of hostility here, big shoots. Wanna know how my Uncle Ed met my Aunt Mary? Walked right up to her, like a sock hop. Told her he thought she was pretty. Uncle Eddie's was a legend. Aunt Marian, too. Then he asked her if she wanted to dance with him. Like, if she wanted to twist. I bet you he swingdanced her. Before he ballroomed 'er. And she walks over to her gal pals and they're all saying, How about the balls on this sailor. Walks right up to a pretty girl like you asking for a twist. Of course they're all green with envy because no one's asked them to twist. That sounds like Uncle Eddie's all right. Yeah, sounds like par for the course for Uncle Eddie. Don't you think it ends there. It doesn't. Guess who walks into the sock hop like he owns the place? Elvis Presley. King of rock 'n' roll. Walks right up to Aunt Mary and says he ain't nothin' but a hound dog. Oh. Tight spot for Uncle Eddie's. What did Uncle Eddie do? Uncle Eddie? Walks right over to the King of Rock 'n' Roll and puts him on his ass. Wow. Uncle Eddie. Next thing you know, in walks the Rat Pack with Chuck Berry and the Beach Boys who hadn't broken yet but were making a name for themselves as California street toughs. Guess what. all good buddies with Elvis. No. He's a goner. Gotta be. Think again. Uncle Eddie gets a tap on his shoulder, a voice says to him he says, Hey, kid. Need a hand? Guess who? You ever heard of Johnny Cash? Well, now you're spinning's a yarn. The Man In Black himself? You better believe it's the Man In Black. He's with his good pals John Wayne and James Brown who don't take shit off anybody. Everybody knows that. You gonna throw hands at James Brown, I'm sorry you're a goner. Everybody knows that. But they're still outnumbered. So guess who shimmies over in a real bad mood? Who? Little Richard. Gotta be. Hey, you better fuckin' believe it's Little Richard. He's with his good pal Bing Crosby. That's PreWhite Christmas when he was still on the bottle and a nasty drunk. So you know it's on now. Number one selling albums of alltimes, White Christmas. Uh, that's Pre White Christmas. Look out. So fuckin' Buddy Holly walks over and Bertuzzi's Uncle Eddie, right? Next thing you know, Ray Charles has got Buddy Holly in a rear naked. Buddy Holly's tappin', Ray Charles says, No way. It's not how this ends. Cash is over there armbarring Sinatra. Sammy Davis Jr. switched sides halfway through the fight, he's got Dean Martin in an Omoplata. Well, where's Uncle Eddie? Well, what's he gonna do? He's gotta do something. Uncle Eddie's freshly transitioned from a triangle choke in favor of a full mount. He's got Brian Wilson down ready to serve the final blow and someone catches his fist. Guess who? Johnny Cash. Says, Hey, kid. We got this from here. Go get your girl. Uncle Eddie gets up, John Wayne gives him a tap on the butt like they're old locker room pals. Well, what's Aunt Marion's doing? Did he go over to her? Tell you what. She went to him, okay. He scoops her up in his arms, fireman carries her out of there to applause from the sock hoppers who clear a path for them. Takes her for a fuckin' milkshake. Like a real man. Wow. Uncle Eddie. So next time you're thinking about texting a girl to ask her out on a date, I want you to stop and think. About what? About the glory you're leaving on the table. Hey, it's her. Well, what she says?. New phone. Who this? LOL. And that's why I never drink out of Gino Reda's mug again. These sheets are just jibber. Oh, hi. Welcome to Sports Centre. I'm Dan, he's Jay. Hello, Dan.
