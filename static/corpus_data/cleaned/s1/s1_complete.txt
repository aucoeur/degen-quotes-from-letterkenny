Got a bit banged up after work the other day. Did you get that stump out of the ground today? I already told you. Dary and I are doing it Friday. You never told me that. Did too. You gotta tell her more than once. She's a woman, not a robot. In all fairness, Dary, that's a twoway street. You know what Dad would say. Plant the corn. Get her goin'. So, how are you gonna do it? Well, Questions McGarrity over here, we chain it up and yank it out like a loose tooth. So, what are you gonna chain it up to? My van. Won't do. Why? 'Cause that might be a little too punk rock, Dary. What's wrong with my van? More than a coat of paint. Go on. More than two coats of paint. Get after it. Rear end differential. Front end differential. Alternator. Battery. Doesn't matter. She'll perform. Well, fucking measure twice, cut once then, bud. You said yesterday, it could win a demolition derby. No I never. I said yesterday it was fit for a demolition derby. No you never. Ain't no reason to get excited. It's not what you said. You better settle down over there or I'm gonna come talk to you. You know what, there's two things I don't like about you, and it's your face. There's one thing you're not gonna like about your own face. That's when I come over there and give it the beats. You boys ever had a peanut butter sandwich? You're one end. You're the other end. Stick you's together and you're just stuck. Really scraping the bottom of the yoghurt cup for that nugget of wisdom, aren't you? You appreciate my metaphors, Katy. That's what I appreciate about you. Is that what you appreciate about me? Stake about five to 10% offer over there squarely down. Yeah. No. Huh? So any other insights for us? Uh. Heck! You wouldn't mind a quick heads up from a fella who's about to steam press his Calvins. And that's your lesson for today, folks, farts always win. That right there was an air biscuit. That was a real ass flapper, if I do say so, myself. Some fine colon bowling. Some real rectal turbulence. Wayne, you gonna weigh in on this? Well there's nothing better than a fart. Except kids falling off bikes maybe. Fuck, I could watch kids fall off bikes all day. I don't give a shit about your kids. I wish Gail could hear that fart. I've got a couple pals who'd appreciates it too. Wouldn't it be kinda neat if you could like, catalog your farts? What for? Well, I feel like if other people could hear that crack splitter it could have a positive impact on their lives. That may be the nicest thing everybody has ever said about me. You should be able to keep track of and record your farts. And your friends' farts. Like Facebook? Exactly like a Facebook. Just like. Fartbook. Step one, we got to builds us a website. How are we gonna fuck that pig? I guess we gots to calls up the internets. Oh, yeah? You got a phone number for the internet, Dan? Well, I'm pretty sure they added me on Skypes a while back, I mean, I gots to check my emails. Outstanding. Well, I have an idea, it's gonna chap a few asses but, there's a fella we know right here in town who can builds us a websites so we don't even have to calls up the internets, you know. Skip that middle man. Right, we'll skip the middle man. Who is. The internet. Who is it, Dan? Um, Stewart. Hard no. You gots a better idea? Better than going into business with a meth head? One or two. Now hold your good goddamn horses here, let's put it to a vote, those for. Those against. Get real. Then she's bought and paid for. Two against one. So, driving Pete's family's out of town, he had a bit of a Texas Hold'em Tournament. And I went over there with my secondcousins. Who, Garrett? And Jarrett. Well, Pete gets all liquored up. Long story short, me and the cousins, just standing there in the kitchen having a beer watching Pete hang a piss down his own basement stairs. Then he turns the cock on himself, pisses all over his goddamn chest. Then he falls down his own pisssoaked stairs. What are you gonna do? It's like, Hey, it's your fucking house! But also, Fuck! It's your house. So it's Facebook. But for farts? That's right. Cartoonish. We're in. But, drop the The. Just, Fartbook. It's cleaner. There was never a The. And we want 30%. Of what? Amateurs. Money, generated from the site! We are not gonna be making any money off the site. Yes, we will. Once we get enough members playing the butt trumpet, we will sell ad space and make a fortune. Now, let's talk about marketing. Who should we target to buy ad space on Fartbook? Indian food. Greek food. Asian noodle soups. What about ring tones? Instead of putting your phone on silent, you put in on silent. But deadly. You are an idiot. He's a. Wait. You're an idiot. Is geostamping farts a good idea? Of course it is. Popcorn, fart location, movie theater. That's information I's wants to know! No. Why not? 'Cause it's too complicated. It's like algebra. Why you gotta put numbers and letters together? Why can't you just go fuck yourself? The kids will fucking love that shit. Yeah, you know what else kids love, keys. Dangling in front of their faces. They fucking love it. Fine. No ads then. Shake on 30%. Anything down the road will be negotiated in good faith. Beggars can't be choosers. Meritorious! Give us.24 hours. Eduardo. We're ranking farts. I need the algorithm. I need the algorithm. How are you now? Hey. Not too bad. Good, and you? Huh? Oh. Gentlemen. Fartbook. I don't. I. I just. What's wrong with you? Seeing it all come together. Sort yourself out. Here's what we've done. I am, at this point, the only member of Fartbook. Each member will be able to upload three farts. Each member will post a picture to their farts. Members will then be allowed to friend request each other and accumulate audiences for their farts. For example. My profile. Wanna know, that's. That's mint. Like the. Little bull snort there in the middle there, Stewart. I really like the placement of the fizzler at the end. Thank you. Now, shall we sign one of you up? Oh! Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Daryl. Oh, fuck. Shit. Cunt. Fuck. Wait a sec. Can I go eat a can of Chef Boyardee? Oh! No times. I can farts on command. Okay? Mmmmmm. Ready. Ahem, I recommend recording through a professional studio mic but the internal computer mic will work for now. Okay, Dan. Ready? Go. Oh, very nice. Boy howdy. Onto the second one. Go. That was a winner. Really nice work, Dan. Really nice work, Dan. Fuck, is this awkward. Onto number three. No, no, no. I can do better. I wants to go again. No, I think you should keep it. No one likes a fart that sounds too staged. Do you wanna know what? He's right. Like that person who just happens to have burst out laughing in every group photo they're in? Like the camera just happened to catch that magic moment in every single one. That like, Say cheese. You're not fooling me, bud. Nope. If you think, if you think it's a good idea. It's a good spread there. Like. It's a good spread. I suggest we, um, send it out to a test audience, before it goes live. Um. Get some feedback. Iron out the bugs. Suggestions? Gail. Duh. What about the Ginger? Mmm. What about Boots? Oh, mmm, the Ginger. You guys. Ever heard anything about that guy fucking an ostrich? I heard it was Boots who fucked the ostrich. No. The Ginger fucked an ostrich. Allegedly. Let's see. It'd take more than one guy to fuck an ostrich. You think they were both there? Like, Boots held down the ostrich?. I suppose. If you really wanted to get to the bottom of it. We could find someone, someone who farms ostriches. Who might know how they get fucked. I don't think we need to invite them, though. We should get the hockey players in on this. Those dgens would lap this right up. Maybe get Glen. Get the Christians on board. Agreed. And we should also get Katy into the fracas. I'll talk to her. The fuck you will. Wondrous. You talk to her, then. We reconvene back here in 24 hours. Yeah. Oh, yes. Go. Hey, has Katy liked any of your farts on Fartbook? No, you? Huh. No. Huh. We got a problem. We need to talk to Gail. Gail. How are you now? Good and you? Not so bad. Gail, we've summoned you here today to talk about your Fartbook profile. Okay. Let's listen. Everything about that so right. Wrong. You've attached messages to each of your farts. For example, send this fart to ten people or you will have bad sex for the rest of your life. But see, I had just got that message from someone else. So it's like, if I didn't send it, then I'd be stuck having bad shaboink forever. And I enjoy a horizontal refreshment for my vertical smile too goddamn much to take that risk. It's called spamming, Gail. Never heard it called that. Heard it called spunking one or two times. No. Sending annoying messages to people who have not requested it is called spamming. Okay. And it's annoying. No. No. No. Yes. Yes. If you continue to misuse Fartbook, we'll have to suspend your membership. Suspend my membership? Why don't you suspend my fist in your ass, you little fuck. If you ever threaten me like that again, I'll spread your cheeks and I'll feed you a Kentucky Klondike Bar, you little twat. I'll drop an Alabama Hot Pocket in your deuce maker, Charlie. I'll fuckin' land shark your shit house so fast you'll be crying for your mother, you fucking asshole. Fuck you, Stewart. You drop deuces in every orifice of your body, you fuckhead! Tear you into a PopTart!. And then I will. We've got another problem. Where's Katy? What?. Katy. We've summoned you here today to talk about your Fartbook profile. Super. Let's listen. Problem? Those are cat farts. Right. You've got a picture of your cat under each of your farts. It's not my cat. It's just a barn cat. I seen a coon having sex with a barn cat on top of my truck one time, fuck. What's the nature of that, David Suzuki? No one cares about your cat's farts. But look how cute they are. Not to be impolite, but you're the only one who thinks so. Everybody whose got a cat or a kid, is going to think their cat's or kid's farts are super special and unique. They're not. They are just a cat or a kid fart. In addition, you've been updating new farts from your cat almost hourly. Oh, that's because there's so many cute farts. Like I can't even keep up. (HIPHOP MUSIC PLAYING). Katy! What is this fucking gong show? We're supposed to be napping right now, boys. What? We are at home. In the middle of a 'Chel tournament with big dingers in. When we see you've been liking all this duster's farts on Fartbook. And none of this beauty's farts. And not one of this grain fed, USDA certified, 100% nonanimal tested, organic beauty. Not one. You're welcome. Thanks, buddy. So? So he's gonna think you wanna fucking wheel him. He's gonna think that you wanna turn on the jets. Because I like his farts? Yes. I'm just pushing a button. It doesn't mean anything. What the fuck are you looking at, you fuckin' pilon? Fucking vampire. Pipe down, idiots. Get in the house. Now. I'm gonna get you, you fuckin' pheasant! We're comin' phezzy! Guys. Boy, you're havin' quite a day, Superchief. We've got another problem. Where's Glen? Daryl, Rage Monkeys. Daniel. Wayne. We've summoned you here today to talk to you about your Fartbook profile. Allonsy. You have no photos and no farts but are friends with everyone along for the test drive. Hmm. I'm not friends with everyone. I'm not friends with Wayne yet. But I wanna be. It seems as though you were just cruising through Fartbook liking and commenting on everyone's farts but contributing nothing yourself. Nothing. I am as God made me. Blessed with a very healthy gastrointestinal system. Not super farty. What you're doing is called creeping. Not what Fartbook is all about. I genuinely enjoy farts. You can't just go around creeping other people's farts. What the truck is wrong with that? If you continue to misuse Fartbook, we'll have to suspend your membership. Fine. Fine. Fluff you then. I have millions. And I mean, millions of ways of hearing unlimited farts. We're done here, Glen. Are we though? Are we? I think we should pump the brakes on Fartbook. That's a Texassize 104. Why? It's kicking up too much dust. We haven't even gotten into it and already folks are gettin' chapped asses. Well, that's their problem. Not ours. This is our problem. We started Fartbook so that good folks could share farts with other good folks. That's it. Not to creepin' farts, or spam farts. Although, if you eat spam, you'll get good farts. Farts should never come between the love of a man and a woman. It's not right. You don't get to 500 million farts without making a few sharts. Exactly. So, what are you saying? Fartbook dies today. Today, Fartbook is dead. Oh. You think so? I'm with the fellas on this one. It's not why we invented it. You invented it? Our idea. We built the site. You know, you really don't need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this. If you were the inventors of Fartbook, you'd have invented Fartbook. Hold your horses there. Let's put this to a vote. Those for closing down Fartbook, raise your hands. Those against? But we own 30 percent. This isn't fair! If you want to sit on our backs and call yourselves tall, you have every right to do so. But don't think that we're gonna sit here and enjoy listening to you lie. You have a bit of our attention, you have the smallest bit of our attention. When did we ask for your attention? The rest of our attention is back at the offices of Fartbook, where my friends and I are doing things that no one on this farm, especially and including you idiots, are intellectually, creatively, artistically, emotionally, or spiritually capable of doing. Have I adequately answered your condescending question? What question?. Farts! You better lawyer up, asshole, because I'm not coming back for 30 percent, I'm coming back for everything. I. I don't know what happened just now. No. No. You know, I've been thinking about Fartbook. What about it, bigshits?. I think maybe we pulled the cord too quick on that, you parachute. I miss it too, threepoint shoes. I was on there a lot. Too much, likely. I was always checking it. It was very addicting. Except, did you ever really stop to think about one thing, did you? Rippin' farts into your computer doesn't exactly spike the likelihood of having sex with girls. Hey! Hey! Hey! Not now. Need 20 minutes. Okay. Just wanted to let you know that Glen stole our website. It's been live for more than 36 hours. Hey! Hey! Fuck it!.  Oh! Fuck's sake. Jesus! Fucking sort yourselves out. Cheese and rice. I can't remember the last time five men came in this church so aggressively. Or can I? You stole our idea. Hmm. Are you referring to Christian Fart Mingle? What's that? It's like Christian Mingle, but for farts. We asked your help with our idea and you went behind our backs and stole'd it. I didn't. Excuse. Oh, my God. Those are some hairy allegations you are firing, at my face. All your allegations. All of them, completely fricken' false. Baseless. How? Stewart, I did not steal anything. Because the last time I checked, taking advantage of a growing trend was not stealing. What trend? I'll tell you. But first, let's sing a hymn. No. No. Fine. Look, y'all had a good idea, all right? You had a terrific idea. Congratulations. But did you actually think you were the only ones in the world to have it? What are you talking about? I'm talking about Fart culture, Stewart. It's all the rage. It's everywhere. You know. Nothing. Glen will show you. Ever heard of Plenty of Farts? I've heard of Plenty of Fish. It's very much like that, except for farts. Here. Here's the one I like the best. It's called Fart Filter. And I like it because you can put different filters on all of your farts and it's fun. So, yeah, I'll just show you how it works. This one, no filter. Nothing. Who cares? Not Glen, right? Vanilla. Pedestrian. I'm not interested. However, shove that baby through the Hudson filter. What's she gonna sound like? Now there's a renovation. Now suck on your Sutro filter. Now boys, because I'm feeling generous, and we're in the Lord's house, I'm gonna play you the filter that I invented myself. I call it. Valencia. Wow. There is a whole site devoted to glutenfree farts. The point is, it's out there, boys. It's happened. The idea lives in the world. Y'all are too slow. Slow on the uptake. Sad story. Boohoo. Toottoot! Go away. Let's go. Sad face, sad face, angry face. Better slow down there, Bigshoots. Tomorrow's gonna be a great day for hay. If you can be a man at night, you can be a man in the morning. Wayne, how come you didn't join Fartbook? 'Cause you're not supposed to fart in front of girls. What? There's certain things that should stay sacred between a man and a woman. So, all things considered, this whole thing's pretty fucking juvenile, if I do say so myself. If she's always listening to your ass acoustics, or even worse, smellin' 'em, I guarantee she'll be slower and slower to crawl into bed with you at night. What you just said is outrageous. No it isn't. It's true. I don't wanna be smelling a dude's ass all the time. Get real. What are you? Some kind of fart purist? So what are you supposed to do? Just hold it in? Or take a shit, you fuckin' degenerate. Speaking of shit, my second cousin's got IBS. Who, Garrett? No, Jarett. No. IBS, the International Business Solution? IBS stands for Irritable Bowel Syndromes. Anyhoo, when he was a kid, Jackass comes out on the air, so it becomes real popular in his high school, for kids to start taking shits in places what weren't meant for taking shits in. They calls that guerrilla shittin'. Is this a true story? So, he became real popular with his friends, with his ability to take a shits any time he needed to. They'd call him up when they get an idea of a place that needed a shits taken in, and be like, Hey, why don't you comes over here and takes a shits? Anyhow, this one time his pal texts him up, and he says, Hey, why don't you come take a shits in the girls' bathroom? So, he drinks a coffee, eats a bran muffin, heads on down to the washroom there, but when he opens the bathroom door, what does he find? But this pretty young girl just dropping a shits, right there in the middle of the bathroom floor. And that's how he met his lovely Eunice. And they fells in love, and they've been together ever since. They raised three little shits. So. With all due respect, Miss Katy, there is a market for gentlemens what can find ladies who like, uh, farts, or shits, or even guerrilla shittin's. That is not a true story. That is a true story. God help us all. You know what, I don't know why you guys need everybody knowing your business anyway. Like why you gotta put everything on the internet, while you're doing it, or after you're done doing it? Well, if you don't puts it on the internet, how's gonna people know what you did? Do you wanna know what? That's your problem right there. Should be playing your cards close to your chest. Keep the ladies guessin' a little bit. Be the mystery man. Right again. Oh, if a woman's not gonna love me for my farts or for me posting my bowling scores on the internet. Not really sure I want one. Well, then it's a good thing you's two have each other. You heard a couple nut sacks talkin' about hockey the other day. This kid. Kid is a fuckin' stud. Kid's a fuckin' beauty. Fuckin' look at this kid. Fuckin' love this kid. Kid lights lamp. Hashtag lamp life. Eat, sleep, lamp. Don't give him too much space, buddy. He'll dangle. He'll dangle all the fuckin' way to outer space. Suck some Martian titties up there, boys. Just getting super sloppy all over our space dinks. Silky mittens, top tittens. Ferda boys. Ferda! Ferda! Big roadie to the big city this weekend, Schmelt. Do you know what that means? Um. Suckin' city titty, idiot. Suckin' all that big city titty, idiot. All up that big city slam piece. Big city slams, idiot. Big city billet moms. Big city billet sisters. Let's get our dinks sucked on, boys. Yes. Hey, how's school going, Schmelt? It's going. Just kidding. We don't give a fuck. Get our pops, Schmelt. Big city slams, Schmelt. How are ya now? Not so bad. Good and you? Not too bad. Have you shit yourself? You look like you've got an awkward boner. Don't. Don't what? Dan? Did you know that Daryl used to get boners every morning in grade nine during O Canada? No shit. Yep. Just could not get through O Canada without getting a boner. Give a young man 30 idle seconds and he's gonna get a boner. We talked about this. Is there something you want to talk about now? Well, pitter patter, let's get at 'er. Well, I was wondering if this year we could skip the birthday party? Skip your super soft birthday party? Are you fuckin' high? Hard no. Daryl's super soft birthday party? Every year, Daryl's mom used to throw him these birthday parties when he was a kid. Softest birthday party on planet Earth. Boy band karaoke, cupcake decoration station, charcuterie. One year, his mom had him a Make the world a better place party. One year they dressed a horse up like a unicorn and he was never really the same after that. It's not funny. I used to take a lot of teasing in school for those. Aw, should I get you a tissue, Sally? No, he'll have one in his purse. Or maybe his clutch. Party's happening, Daryl. You don't fuck with tradition. So. The agenda. After your dust up over the weekend, safe to assume you're fighting again? Corect. Tenfour, good buddy. Well, it's gonna be a busy week 'cause there's a few guys walking around town claiming to be the toughest guys in Letterkenny. I'm the toughest guy in Letterkenny. You were the toughest guy in Letterkenny. It's been some time. Now, it's safe to assume that that title is as important to you now as it was then? Does a duck with a boner drag weeds? Tenfour, good buddy! Then it's safe to assume that the challengers will be coming up around the farm, as that is how you've conducted business in the past. Well, I was never one for an audience. All right, let's talk about the challengers. First up, we've got Sled Ted. Why's he called Sled Ted? Well, he likes fixin' sleds, and ridin' sleds, and talkin' about sleds. He just really likes sleddin', boys. Uh, he beat up a guy named Basic Jay. Why's he called Basic Jay? 'Cause he's a fuckin' basic. And now he thinks he's the toughest guy in Letterkenny. After that, we got Rat Ass. Why's he called Rat Ass? 'Cause he's got a hairy ass like a rat. Can confirm. He beat up a guy named Brains. See, his name's Brian but he spelt it Brain in the computer at bowling one time. It just kinda stuck. Now he thinks he's the toughest guy in Letterkenny. And after that, we got Joint Boy. Because he smokes lots of joints, Dairy. Well, just plucking the low hanging fruit is what that is. I've seen that guy take on four bouncers at the rippers one time. He is otherworldly. Got a dome on him like an Easter Island statue. Is he single? Not that it matters, I guess. Look, keep it at the end of the lane way. No degens on the property. That's a Texas size 104. Over and out. Well, this is annoying. The fuck are they doin' out there? They're scared of you. This snipe is a fuckin' sniper. Snipe's a fuckin' beauty. Fuckin' look at this snipe. Fuckin' love this snipe. We're snipe selling, boys. Dirty fucking dangles, boys. You're a sniper. You're a snipe. You're a skirt, you pansy. If you make me walk up the lane way again, we're having babies. Put it out! Put it out! Put it out! Fuck! Fuck! Those boys need to give their balls a tug. Maybe, check, make sure they're still attached right quick. I'd rather put a mirror down there and see what's what. One time, my cousin. He tore open his ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick and he had to show it to his mum. Was it his scrotal sack? Well, you know. That dangly piece of flesh, what hangs down behind the penis. Scrotal sack. The nut sack. So, he tore his ball sack open trying to do a skateboard trick and he's gots to show it to his mum because apparently one of his testicles was showing. Was it the right one or the left one? Why is that of importance? Well, because the left one has more sperm in it. Spermatozoa is what it's called. Tell you what, if I ripped open my ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick, I'd be more worried about seeing my vas deferens. Well, you'd have to tear your ball sack pretty near wide open doing a skateboard trick if you wanted to see your own vas deferens. I'm not sure I wanna see my own vas deferens I think if I saw my own vas deferens, I'd be quite worried. I'd be most worried if I tore my ball sack open trying to do a skateboard trick if I could see my accessory glands. Well, you don't want to go too kooky with accessories on your truck. Or your jeep. It's okay with like, a quad, though, like my buddy Big T's got a snorkel kit on his and that's pretty punk rock. What's an accessory gland? Well, if your vas deferens is your sperm ducts, the accessory glands is what supplies lubricant to the sperm duct. I think if I ripped open my ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick, I'd be most worried about seeing my seminal vesicles. Oh, like the Florida State seminal vesicles? Like the sack that hangs behind your vas deferens and contains fructose which is energy for the sperm. Yeah, it's like when you go in the city there and they got them charge stations for the people that drive the electric cars. That's pretty much your seminal vesticles. I thought it was pretty funny when I said Florida State seminal vesicles and nobody laughed. Hello. Okay. End of the lane way. Don't come up the property. Good. Sled Ted's here. Geez, Basic Jay must have been a shit fighter to lose to that asshat. I've known Basic Jay to be a pretty tough dude. He's not really a fuckin' basic. Guess he could have had a cold. Or the flu. Sled Ted had Bigfoot hands. Yeah, he's a big grimy brute. Shit fighter, though. Do you guys remember the fragrance Brut? Or Actif Brut? Yeah. Yeah, they still make that. I always enjoyed that fragrance. You can use it to dry up zits too. Did you know you can use shaving cream to get permanent marker off your hands? Why wouldn't you just dip your hands in the parts cleaner? Well, most people don't have a parts cleaner. Well, most likely Rat Ass will be your next dude. I hear that he is a greaser. Can confirm. So fuckin' greasy I almost don't want to. I saw him with his shirt off, swimming at the gravel pit not that long ago. His back acne was extraordinary. Well, like, extraordinary how? Well, like, I thought about it for a while after is all. Well, elaborate, 'cause I'm likely gonna have to touch it. Well, like how it was cultivated. Well, by not showering likely. Likely. Did you know that men can wear the fragrance CK ONE as well as women? Yeah. Yeah. That's 'cause it's an unisex fragrance. It says that right on the bottle. But would ya? Oh, negative. Me neither. Would you wear Gap Dream?. No! No, no, Dairy, that's for girls. Dairy, that's for girls. You can't walk around smelling like pretty girls. You're not wearing it right now, are you? Cologne is too expensive. I just use sunscreen. Banana Boat. Let's get into some of those fuckin' all dressed chips. Jesus, Katy, put some fuckin' clothes on. Not my forte. Unfortunate. Hey, neighbor said he's not gonna give us a horse this year. What? Well, he said that last year we returned him and his breath smelled like alcohol. Well, it was probably mine. You could have lit my breath on fire the next day. Horse was half cut though. He said that he's gonna give us a donkey. Nope. Might be funny. Gotta be a horse. You don't fuck with tradition. You're really gonna pump the brakes on a donkey dressed up like a unicorn? Oh, I'm stompin' the brakes. You put that idea right through the fuckin' windshield. But it's a donkey dressed up like a unicorn. Katy! Well, it's better than a kick in the pants. Do you want this to be the softest birthday party ever or not? I want this just as much as you do. Well, then find us a horse. Please and thank you. And don't stay out in the sun too long. Your skin will look like an old saddle bag. Yeah. Hello. Okay. End of the lane way. Don't come up the property. Good. Rat Ass is here. Keep it standing. This goes to the ground, we stand up. Okay. This goes to a clinch, we separate. Great. Let's go! All right. So, hit me. Fight him or shut the fuck up. I'll give you a free one. What the fuck is this? Let's fuckin' do this. Just fuckin' square off. Hey! He's pulling hair, he's pulling hair. Break 'em up, break 'em up. Come on, come on!. I'm gonna clock this shitty wolverine. Hit me. Come on. I love pain. Look at the execution, boys. Look at the hustle, boys. Ding. You guys made the liquor run, right? I was Donny Drives the car. I was Nicki Navigates. But, uh. We couldn't find a lot of the stuff on the list. Yeah. Like what? Uh, well. Uh, there's ingredients that I don't think you can get in Letterkenny. Yeah. So, go to the city. Yeah, but we got practice in a couple of hours. We're gonna crush a couple sandos before, too. Grab some nappies, maybe? We haven't had our pregame naps either. Nappies are nappies. Ferda. Ferda. Well, we need everything on the list. So, what drinks do you need ingredients for? Uh, Corebelo Love Potion. Uh, Purple Passion Punch. Lemon Gingerini. Apricot Toblerone Cocktail. Couldn't find a Flirtini. Couldn't find Sparkling Mango Sorbet Float. Don't. Don't know really what that is. Well, that's all of them. Ye. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I have about a million things to do if this is gonna be the softest birthday party ever. If you guys don't get me everything on the list, you'll be pulling each other's horns from now on. Pitter patter! So far! Fuck, was he a beaker. Like, he would not stop beaking. That shit is the worst. That was right to stick to the task at hand, pal. Keep your trap shut. Throw bombs. I wouldn't say shit if my mouth was full of it. I haven't seen that many hits since Good Charlotte played Warped Tour. Yeah, more like. Not very Good Charlotte. I always liked NOFX. YESFX. Big fuckin' day, Dairy. Big fuckin' day! Big fuckin' day! Ow. Happy birthday, it's your special day Dairy. Birthday beats! Birthday beats! Ow. Oh, that's not polite, Katy. You really are a Sally. That's the most action I've seen since I gave the dairy cows' teats a good scrubbin'. I don't need to know that. You're pretty good at wrestling there, Katy, and that's what I appreciates about you. Is that what you appreciate about me? Let's go easy over there, squirrelly Dan. Yeah. Oh, hey, look at you, ground. So, tell me about this guy, Joint Boy. Well, I'm not gonna sugar coats it for you, Wayne. This guy looks like an Australian rugbies player, chiseled out of stones. Uhoh. Got legs on him like tree trunks. Is that a deciduous tree or a coniferous tree? What? Well, there's a difference. If we're talking about, like, a maple tree, which is thick and deciduous or a Christmas tree, which is thin and coniferous. Yeah, but both is hards and mades of woods, right? There's a difference is all I'm saying. What type of tree is a coconut tree? It's a palm tree. How do you know? Well, like the Internet. Oh. Anyways, backs to Joint Boy. How come I've never heard of him before? Oh, he just gots out of jail. He was arrested for assaults after he beats the shits out of a guy for pushin' up on his sister. Got this big entourage of guys, baldheaded, bearded dudes what looks like a whole bunch of surly uncles. You think we should call The Ginger? Mmm. No. Why not? He's tougher than hell. Yeah, but. Well, like you heard he fucked an ostrich, right? He what? He fucked an ostrich. Allegedly. How does a fella get caught up in that sort of business? Well, I guess his cousin had an ostrich farm when he thought it might be fun to fuck one. Allegedly. So, he got hard somehow and he fucked an ostrich. That's fucked. That's a felony. So, we use him in emergencies only, then. I should say. Dairy. Hey, Dairy. This one's for you. Oh. Hey, Joint Boy's here. Which one of youse is Wayne? We got some business. You're interrupting a party for my best pal that my little sister worked pretty hard to put on. Hold it. May I sort this out now, please? Goddamn right you may. Thank you. Don't lose. You had yourself a scrap the other weekend at Modean's. What's it to ya? You left the dude pretty banged up. I heard he kicked a slow learning fella in the bum while he was havin' a piss. Now, that slow learning fella is my second cousin. Okay. Being the toughest guy in Letterkenny is important to me. I'm sure it is to you too but we're all hicks here. And you've done me a favor, so I'd be willing to shake your hand and call it a day. I didn't do you no favors. 'Cause I don't know who the fuck you are. We done talking? You wanna come to a super soft birthday party? Happy birthday, Dairy. It's really more for them, ain't it? What is?. All this. No, it's not. It's cream cheese. No. That's cream cheese. No. Yeah, that's cream cheese. Just go. Jesus! You remember they weren't allowed to have birthday parties growing up. They had to go bucky at mine. All they do is go alls out, don'ts they?. That's a Texas size 104. You know, if Joint Boy and his pals hadn't showed up, I figure this would have been the softest birthday ever. That's a small victory for you, I suppose. I was worried. Thought I might have to get Stewart and the Skids to come over here and start hoovering up that white powder of theirs. Anything for a little bit of an edge, am I right?. The white stuff. The snooter. The devil's dandruff. The dander. I. I hoovered up a bit of the schneef in my day. You ever hoovered barnyard schneef? I've hoovered behind the manure pile schneef. You ever hoovered schneef off a sleeping cow's spine? I've hoovered schneef off of an awake cow's teat. What are the odds that I ride him home bareback? Gonna hurt your balls, bro. Good going. Oh, yeah. You ever hoovered library schneef? I've hoovered schneef off of the cover of Gordon Korman's This Can't Be Happening at Macdonald Hall. You wanna come home with me? You can sleep in my bed. He'd break it. He'd break your bed. His dick alone would break your bed. I saw that too. I. Yeah. It was really big. You ever hoovered Sunday school schneef? I've hoovered schneef off the collection plate in the rectory. Do you know what dick dingers are? Yep. You know that movie with the guy who whispers to horses. Brokeback Mountain? No. No. That's the toughest guy in Letterkenny. A couple hockey players come up to the produce stand the other day. Bye! Can't believe your sister's still dating these nut sacks. Wayne. How're you now?. Good and you? Not so bad. Hi, Katy. Go home, Daryl. Nice onesie. Does it come in men's? Oh, I think you cum in men enough for all of us. I think you better come in my. I mean, you better come. I think you better come say that to his face, you fucking hicks! Nice execution. You're doin' terrific. Hey, I heard about your breakup, buddy. She was your sweetie for five years, right? Your high school sweetie, right? What's it to ya? Heard she cheated on you, buddy. That's a real kick in the knackers, bro. Just a real ouchie, bro. It's too bad she taught you not to fight anymore, buddy. 'Cause that's a fight on sight for you and her new guy, buddy. Fourth line for life, bro. Maybe, if you'd ever been in a real fight, you might not be so keen for another. What did you say? You heard me. Hold my spitter. Darts off, boys. You looking for a tilly, buddy? Let's have a donnybrook. Pump the brakes. You take your shirt off, but leave your sunglasses on? What sort of backwards fuckin' pageantry is that? Do you want to fight with those shades or play pokerstars.com? Hold my spitter. Dude, I can't hold your spitter. You're holding my spitter. Just put the spitters down. Ticktock. Go time! Go time! Look at that fuckin' treasure trail. What's up with your fuckin' body hair, big shoots. You look like a 12yearold Dutch girl. Your aesthetician quaff that for you?. You can kiss my assthetician. You guys do cross fit? You can crossfuckoff. Cross fart. How many times you pulled your horn today, bud? What? Oh, she's bashful. Oh, come on, kitten. I won't tell anyone. Ball park six to eight? You're a fucking animal. Play a little five on one. Hit the kitchen, mix a batch. Feed the ducks. Distribute some free literature. Go time! Fuckin'. Shed 'em! Riley! Jonesy! Put your fuckin' shirts on! Get outta here!. This isn't over! Jinx. You owe me a Coke. Never buy you a Coke. It's a hard life pickin' stones and pullin' teats but sure as God's got sandals it beats fightin' dudes with treasure trails. Hi, Katy. We're out of yogurt. I brought some from home. So why didn't you stay there and eat it. Mornin' Dary. Mornin'. Thank you. Welcome. So, you talked to Angie yet? It's been almost a month now. Think you need to get back on the horse. She stepped out on you. Can't go back to that and get any respect. Not in Letterkenny. Wayne, Angie did you a lot of good. Somewhere along the way you kinda got soft. You're not even fighting anymore. You know what you need? Sex. With a girl. Not just any girl. A good Christian girl. I think I can help you. I've been going to the Burning Bush Youth Group every Sunday. I think you should come with me. I think you should just eat your yogurt. There's millions of starving kids in the world. Yeah? Name ten. You need a distraction. Something fun. Look at this. It's called Tinder. Look, see there's all these girls and if you don't like one, you just say nope and move onto the next. But if you do like one, then you can see how close they are and I don't know, maybe meet up or whatever. So if you like 'em you just type 'em out a message or what's the scoop? Yeah. You just, you know, say something like. Like, On a scale of one to America, how free are you right now? Oh, Jesus! Look at these nut sacks. Why do you hate them so much? 'Cause hockey players would grab a monkey by the tit if they could. Smokes are for jokes, bud! Put it out before it puts you out, bud! Trash the ash, pal! Ouch! Put it out! Put it out! Put it out! Put it out! Tell the fish hook story, Dan. It's really more of a Wayne story. Yeah, but he won't tell it. Oh, you've heard it a baker's dozen times. Tell the story or he won't shut up. Is there anymore trail mix? It's in the house. Yous makes the most delicious trail mix, Katy, and I got to say that's what I appreciates about you. Is that what you appreciate about me? Pitterpatter, squirrely Dan. So, as the story goes, Wayne hucks an egg at a truck with a Confederate flag in the back windshield and the driver's fumin' pissed. So, we flee the scene goin' full tilt like a Peterbilt, right? Now, The Federales catch up to us and chase us through a few backyards before we scamper up into some trees and all Wayne's got on is a pair of cutoff jean shorts so he ain't exactly super jazzed about the situation, was you Wayne? Oh, I'm no DJ Jazzy Jeff. The Federale pulls out his Taser, and he points it up at Wayne and says some real Clint Eastwoodsounding shit. He says to Wayne, he says, If I'd known I was going to run into some uptown street toughs today, I'd have done up my top button.. That's from a John Wayne motion picture. No, Cool Hand Luke. Pert near anything Kevin Costner, really. Either way, I's impressed and I'd let out an audible gasp so he hears me, spins around, aims the Taser up at me and lets fire, and if that thing doesn't latch onto my nipple ring, which I'm pretty sure amplified the electric current, he sent coursing through my entire body. And they just walked over and yanked that thing out of my nipple like it was a goddamn fish hook. At least that's according to my cousin. Well, you know, my second cousin. Who, Garrett? No, Jarrett. Huh. I cried. I'm not even ashamed to admit that. That was well brought up. Too bad you weren't. I should say. Thirsty Thursdays, boys. Might as well get balls deep in a bottle of Gus'n Bru tonight. It's a four leaf clover. Make a wish. Wish you weren't so fucking awkward, bud. Is Angie working?. Better have a peeksee, Wayne. How are yous?. Not too bad. Good. And you? Not too bad. Smells like someone's in their barn clothes. It's Dary. Four shots of Gus'n Bru, please and thank you, One for you, too, Gailor. Thank you, Wayne, but I'm off the sauce. Taking eight vitamins a day now. What are you taking? I'm taking multivitamin, fish oil, vitamin C, vitamin D, two vitamin B complexes and two ColdFX's. Yeah, but 'cept how many darts though? Twenty, 25 darts. Oh, you got 'er down then? Last I seen ya, you were on a pack and a half of smokes. Well, sometimes, I'll have a pack and a half of smokes, but never more than two packs of smokes. Good enough. All right. Won't be rude. I'd hang a piss. Oh, fuck. I'm about to give birth to a pound of fudge. Wayne. McMurray. How're ya now? Good 'n you? Not so bad. Seen Angie, with her new dude? What a fuckin' dandy. Yeah. He's got fugazidiamonds in both ears and leprechaun buckles on his shoes. Running a fuckin' DippityDoo convention upstairs for a salad. Driving a '94 Jeep YJ with a wave decal on the side. Enough cologne to offend a Bangkok lady boy. Good enough. Do you want to hear the best part? You really wanna hear the best part. Okay. He went full Bieber eyes. What? Bieber eyes. Wayne. Wayne. Wayne, look. It's inappropriate, McMurray. Wayne, just look for fuck's sake. Just fuckin' look, Wayne. Full Bieber eyes. What's that? Bieber. The pop star. I'm not familiar with his work. This must be where the dicks hang out, eh? Our dicks hang out. Yours is like a mushroom in a corn field. Mind your fuckin' business, Alexander. Seen Angie with her new dude? What a fuckin' dandy. Eyes on your own work there, super chief. Thank Christ, Wayne, I'm pushing clobs here. Get outta the way, I'm growing a tail. Wayne, I would like to cordially invite you to the Burning Bush Youth Group this Sunday, for an evening of song and praise. Hard no. My sweetie, Margaret, is a first class gal. She's got some friends she can introduce you to. Margaret? Sounds like a biddy old bluehair'd. She's not. She's a very focused young woman on the path to eternity with Christ. And which part of that appeals to you? I like singing the songs. Sort yourself out. You're a pervert, Daryl. Jesus, your breath could stop a Mack truck right now. All right, cool it. What say, we go for a quick ice run, Wayne? I'm pushing up on you for years now. What's say you give old Gailor one for the scrapbook? Huh? I'll do the Youth Group. All right. Gail, looks like the John's allergic to fudge. Bring the plunger, we may have to break this one up. Told you to flush as you go. Fuck. Hi, Daryl. Christ be with you. Margaret. And you must be Wayne. Mmmhmm. Christ be with you, Wayne. Hello. How are yous? Oh, not s'bad. Good 'n you? Perfect. You made a good choice coming here, tonight. Yeah? Why is that? Hold your finger here for as long as you can. What for. All right. Now imagine, your soul engulfed in that for all of eternity. Okay. God is good. That's how they get you. Wayne's been going through a bit of a rough break up, and I thought a night at the Burning Bush might help him out. Plus, it's better than spending all his time on Tinder. Tinder? Did you know that it was originally called Grindr and that it was made for gay men to sodomize each other? No. Yeah. Good way to get a finger in your bum. Or a tongue in your bum. Do you know what Dick Dingers are? No. It's when they snort drugs off of each other's erect penises. That have just been in bums. Oh, my gourd! Look at this turnout. Hi, everybody. Quick question for all y'all. How good is God? I know, I know, I love him. He's the best. There's almost no one I like more. Second question, has anyone seen. Where is my beautiful girlfriend, Virginia? Ginny, where are you?. There she is, Ginny, come on up here. Come up, Ginny. Oh, ugh, Ginny. Ginny, Ginny, Ginny. Hmm. I still remember, like it was yesterday, the day that the Lord gave you to me. And he said, Glen, this is your blank canvas, it is pale. It is colorless, it is almost cardboardlike. I want you to give it life, to give it color. And so I said to the Lord, I will give it everything, everything. Except for one thing. What was that question? Uh, hmm? Vaginal intercourse! Guess what, boys and girls? You're in for somethin' special, 'cause we got The Salty Treats. What the actual fuck is this place? Why can't you just enjoy yourself? It's 'cause I get onto this Tinder thing, and now they tell me it's for finding dudes. But that's some bullshit, right? I don't know. You want some strawberry lemonade? I haven't seen this sort of fuckin' bedlam since we fired Roman Candles at coyotes that night and caught one right in the butt hole, fuck. Ran up the back porch, dropped seven shades of shit in Dad's work boots. Could have been a wolf. There's wolf's in the back bush. There's for sure mooses. Have a dart. Yeah, I'd have a dart. Oh, fuckin' Grindr. Grindr?. Grindr. What? Pray tell, what are you doing on Grindr, Wayne? What are you skids doing out of your parents' basement, Stewart? The gang and I have been doing hiphop karaoke for the better part of 48 hours. Out on the decks. Ones and twos. The entire 48. Subsequently spittin' hot fire. Playing MegaMan and Final Fantasy on original NES. Pokémon Gold, on GameBoy Color. Gotta catch 'em all. Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Charmeleon, Charizard, fuckin' Charmander. Fuckin' Charmander. Time to take about 20% off on the meth intake, boys. Ever played Dr. Mario on Super NES?. Game is full of subliminal messages. Hunter S. Thompson would have had a field day. Hunter S.? Charles Bukowski. Oh, yes, Chuck Bukowski. That's a better one, Stewart. Ever played Aladdin on original Sega G? Coffee? Tea? Sega? Lion King was far ahead of its time. Makes you think far beyond your years. Disney games prevail! You got any weed? I always regret coming to the surface with you, daywalking hicks. The minutiae of your world. My basement resembles an island Xanadu, in comparison. Okay. Ah, but some quick math tells me this time, however, you've been so agonized by a woman you're now seeking the company of men. Oh, okay. We've all thought about it. Well, good on you for doubling down. Although, I didn't peg you for a pipe fitter, Wayne. Pegged! Five years with Angie, we figured you were a concrete clam slammer. Why drink from the furry cup when the garden hose is right there? Who knew he liked the chutney ferret, eh fellas? Fuckin' what? Knob jockey. Back door bandit. I'm gay, but donut puncher! Just gimme my phone. Oh, yeah, sure thing. Oklahomo. Rear admiral. Uphill gardener. Bum bumper. This is awkward for me, you guys. Hey, it's okay. We know, and we support you. All right. Donald Trump of rump! Phone. Okay. But only because you have this weird. Menergy. Menergy! About you. Sorry. That's a great name for a spa. Oh, stop it. You know I love ripping didge. If you don't change your attitude you're gonna lose out on all the girls. Like the 12yearolds or the 13yearolds?. Well, have you noticed all the wellgroomed dudes here?. You missed the best part. Glen just did his didgeridoo solo. Well, that's pretty much it. You guys wanna get some milk shakes? I think Modeans is open. Boy, howdy. Well, well, well. Daryl, girl, Wayne. Bit surprised to see you here, I'm being honest. Didn't realize you were big fan of the didge. Aw. More of a didgeredon't? What do you do with the fertile, Wayne? Didn't I just catch you cruisin' Grindr? Come again? Hey, shouldn't you boys be watching Friday Night Lights with a gym sock on your joy stick? Chirp Tim Riggins. I fuckin' dare you. Mix in a little One Tree Hill and maybe some Gossip Girl. But I think we've got bigger fish to fry right here. Looking for love over the rainbow now, are we Dorothy? I hate you, but can confirm deer season's over. He's hunting bear now. I fuckin' hate you too. However, fuckin' hate him more. And I just found out he's ambidextrous. What are they talking about, Wayne?. He likes dicks now. In his bum. Or his mouth. All over. Oh, my God. That's Angie's new boyfriend? Oh, that's that city boy. What a skirt. What a shit. Fuck, Lemony Snicket, what a series of unfortunate events you fuckin' been through, you ugly fuck. Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Fuck you, Stewart. Hey, fuck you. Yeah, fuck yourself. You must be having a fun night. Ur bro is gay. LMFAO. In all caps, from Riley. Wayne? You remember when you were 19, those worm pickers kept coming in the night and trampling on our beans? What did you do? Dug six foot holes, put a skunk in each one and waited for them to fall in. Remember when the skids egged Daryl on his bike? What did you do? Put some stink bombs in a Nerf gun and fired it at them on prom night. Remember when you came in from chorin' and found those messages on my computer from a guy calling me a slut? I wanted a piece of that guy for a long time. You drove over to his house and broke his nose on his front lawn. You know, I miss that Wayne. I think a lot of people do. It's for the better. This is Sparta! Ow! Fuck! What the hell are you doing? I'd ask you the same thing, you fuckin' tit. I'm taping an idiot. I'm not sneaking up on dudes and starting fights. I'm not fightin' ya. I'm smackin' ya. Oh, that's right. You don't fight anymore, do you? I figured I'd have one on deck for sure after I stole your girl. Nothin', eh? No move? She must've trained you well. So what's it gonna take to get you back on the horse there, champ? Do I go inside and spread Angie right out on the bar when she gets here? I've fucked your girl more times than you've had a hot meal. Maybe your sister wants to join us. It's Katy, right? Shit. Why don't I go over there and ask her myself? Pull your pants up, Alexander. You've come this far. Welcome to fuckin' Letterkenny. Good to have you back, big brother. Hi, Katy. Go home, Daryl. Bye, Wayne. Have a good one bro. Bye, Wayne. See you later, buddy. A bit of fuss down at the church the other day. Glen. Wayne. How are you now?. Good, and you? Oh, not so bad. Ooh, look what you brought with you. Hello, Daryl. Oh, fuck. Fuck, you're naked as a jay bird. Wayne, it's humid. It's the humidity. Y'all might want to think about doing the same thing, just pop your pants right off, that way no one gets sticky. Nope. It's not so bad. What's the fuss? Ma O'Dell mentioned something about you helping her get a squirrel out of her attic. I'm faced with a similar conundrum. Right over there. It seems some kinda rodent's made his home over there. I have not seen him, but I sure can smell him. Hum. It's a possum. Hmm. Possum. That's right. Oh, pitter patter, let's get at 'er. Do you wanna know what? I'd reach into a pirate hooker's chamber pot before I'd reach in there. And I'm going to tell ya. Possums are immune to snake venom. They could probably survive a nuclear blast. I think it's pronounced newcuelar. Mmm, but it isn't. They're mutants. They have forked fuckin' penises. We should all be so lucky. They do this thing called 'Playing Possum' where they appear dead and emit a death stink from their butt holes, fuck. I found one playing possum one time, thought it was dead and buried it. It dug itself out a few hours later and fucked a hen right in front of her chicks. Wayne, think about the swear jar. You're putting so much money in. All right, let me take peek see? Pitterpatter. Always had a skilled hand in wrangling vermin. Thank you, Daryl. And that doesn't surprise me. No sweat. No sweat? In this heat? That is rich and it's funny. Honestly though, just take off your jumper. I'll hold it for you. You crawl up in there, no one gets dirty. Glen? Glen? Yes. Let's take about 20% off 'er up there, all right? Now, you wanna have an eye because he'll come out meaner and spit and go like a hot damn. Is he likely to bite? Is a duck's ass watertight? Get ready to give him the size nine's if he jukes by me. How be I give him the size twelve and a halfs instead? Oh, I see him. That's some drunk evolution right there, bud. You gotta wonder what two Christmade miscreants mated to make that. It's almost not worth thinkin' about. Do I just reach for him? That's a better idea than going in head first. Put him where? Under my boot. Boys, just do your best not to make too big a mess, all right? And I'm sorry again about all this heat. Whoohoo! Oh, for fucksakes. Ow. You wish there was a Pied Piper for possums, but there isn't, so you're gonna have to just keep pickin' 'em off with the .22. Buckle up 'cause they're fuckin' ugly. Of course, that's not to say I have it all my damn self. Is that a herpe on your hand, Daryl? Did you pay a little extra to go all the way with a ripper in the back room again?. No, I don't think he'd make that mistake twice. Got a little trouser trauma? Was she fun or was she fungal? Hey, guess what? A guy's girlfriend is having a hard time parking the car, right? He says, You should get tested. She says, Well no, I'm not so bad at driving. He says, No, I have chlamydia. Is that a bite? The guy takes a hooker out for supper. He gave her his peas, she gave him herpes. Daryl, what happened? Did something bite you?. A possum. A possum?. That's right. Well, he could have rabies. Boo fuckin' hoo. No, rabies is serious. It attacks the central nervous system. If he gets puke between the floor boards it ain't coming out. Well, I can't take him to the clinic. I gotta do an ice run for the jamboree this week. Oh, Christ. Well, Daryl, we're gonna have to take your van. Oh, yeah? Where's your nut sack boyfriend's today, Katy? They're at an away game against the Natives. Oh, I bet they're looking forward to playing those tough pricks. Christ. You sure you're ready to saddle up to the jamboree again? It was kind of you and Angie's thing. No sense sittin' on my hands. Time to find a new dance partner. All right, Daryl. Pitterpatter. Hey, why are crabs always so tired? It's 'cause they only sleep in snatches. Hey, wait a minute. We're. We're missing two schmelts. Where are Deetzy and Burnsy? Oh, looks like a bad case of the Native flu, bro. What's the Native flu? You're an idiot. The Natives are tough as hell. So another way to say someone is chickenshit to play them is to say they have the Native flu. Mix in a fuckin' clue, brotato chip. Keep those fucking bags up, schmelt. Wayne. Bonnie, how are you now? Good and you? Not so bad. This isn't all for you, is it? It sure is. Is it for the jamboree? If we ever get it there. Save me a dance? Yup, sure. Thank you. I've always wanted to dance with you, Wayne. Oh, yeah? We've all been watching you and Angie dance for so long thinking when's it gonna be our turns? Oh, yeah? But trust me, watching was enough. You used to move her body around like it didn't weigh a feather. Well, you know, I think I got about a dozen baker's dozen here I guess we could just scan them and then I'll get out of your hair. Oh, yeah, I'll scan them. Okay. It's broken. It'll be our little secret. Okay, sit down. Oh. Stewart? Katy? You look grisly. You look beautiful. But I can't quite see you right now. What's wrong with you? Meth?. I don't know what you're talking about. You're not a teenager anymore. It's not charming. I use to charm you? Wrong takeaway. You know, you're not a fuckin' idiot. You could turn it around if you wanted to. You know, I remember sneaking into your parties when I was 15, stealing your mixtapes. All your own music. I was really impressed. Guess those days are over, though. All right, Dairy, let's go. Dairy, come on. And yeah. You did use to charm me. McMurray, how're ya now? Not so bad, and you? Not so bad. I see you back to the jamboree, now. A few weeks off there. Oh, you noticed. Well, it's hard not to notice all that Scottish tartan plaid you seem to enjoy so much. I wanted to talk about something important. Okay. My sister Bonnie is back from college, and she's a damn fine woman. Oh, yeah. I just seen her down at the dollar store, there. You sure it was her? I mean, last time I seen her last she was in a kind of a DIY maxi dress, but she may have added a crochet pattern sweater on account of the breeze. Maybe autumn foliage or an Algonquin green? Okay. I think she'd be a damn fine match for you, Wayne. That's if you're ready. You know, 'cause of Angie and all. She's a lovely girl. No, you go ahead. That is if you. But you started, you mind finishing? Oh, it's just, was gonna say the space, looks, looks nice and clean without the. Yup. Run pretty good. Well, all right. All right. Yeah. Hey, uh, I'll let you carry on. It's a good box of ice. Yeah. Yeah, good to see you. Have a good one. Hey, wait. You save her dance now, eh, big boy? Good enough, McMurray. Atta boy. Does that taste right? Ya, okay. Mmm. I think so, I don't know, I don't know. I've had an epiphany! Uh, can you taste this? No. Never again. Okay, okay, okay, then, can you snort it? No. I've given up on the meth business. I'm going back to the turntables. Hmm? Back to the ones and twos. For what? To become a superstar DJ. Oh, okay, okay, uh. But first, can you. Let's just try. No. I need you guys to tell everyone you know that I am hosting a rave in Letterkenny, and I will be spinning under all of my aliases. How many aliases have you had? DJ Pimpy Longstockings, DJ Peter Blumpkin, DJ White Power Nap, DJ White Power Bottom. They'll all be there!. All of them. Mmmmmm, so you're quitting the meth business? I've quit the meth business. But Menergy Spa is still like, a thing though, right? Well, how are you going to get people to come? I'll post it on my fuckin' Facebook. And you guys will post it on your fuckin' Facebooks. Wayne. Christ, Katy, put some fuckin' clothes on. Not my forte. Unfortunate. What are you doing? Well, I think it's pretty obvious that I'm moving hay bales from here over to here. Although, that one's a straw bale. Why? Well, pick up your fuckin' phone. McMurray's been trying to reach you all day. McMurray. At least I was yesterday! How're ya now? Not so bad and you? Not so bad. Listen, Wayne. I've gotta cancel the Jamboree here. The Ag Hall's been booked up. For the whole week? Yes, sir. That's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and guess what else? Sunday. What for? Uh, Stewart. He's throwing a rave. I don't know, he says he needs time to set up or something like that. Said something about a glow stick Segway saunter across the rainbow road level of Mario Kart for Nintendo 64? I don't know, what the fuck. And you greenlit that tomfuckery? Had to. Agricultural Hall is low on funds. Allday bookings is a big boost for us. So, I couldn't say no. Agricultural Halls are for Agricultural music. Not for fuckin' raves. Well, that's no way to get your communication badge, boy scout. Dairy. DARYL ON. Wayne. Clinic. Pick up. Not feel good. Well, he's not gonna get his communication badge, either. Dairy. What's the fuss? Good 'n you? Where you goin'? I don't know where I am. Don't look at your hand. What's the fuss? Think I have rabies. Oh, boo fuckin' hoo, big shootsywootsy. But 'cept do you wanna know what? What's that? Nabbing that possum was kind of a thrill. I think I could start a pest removal business. Oh, Daryl, that's just silly. But 'cept do you wanna know what? I'm gonna help you. You know Stewart's having a rave at the Ag Hall? Agricultural Halls are for agricultural music. Not for fuckin' raves. That's what I said. So here's what we're gonna do and I'm gonna tell ya. We're gonna wrangle as many of those critters as possible, and let 'em loose at Stewart's rave. How do we get the word out about the business? Oh, you'd have to put it on your fuckin' Facebook, likely. Over and out. Look at this bowl of fruit salad. You want a taste, Tanis? Ooh, better watch that bark there. Boy might get bit. What's going on here? You're looking a handful short. Caught a bad case of the Native flu, or what? You're drunk. Mix in a water. Well, it's either that or you're all tweaking down that meth town you come from. What did you say? Everyone knows Letterkenny has gone to meth. You guys a bunch of fuckin' basics. At least we keep it clean. We just sell cigarettes. Your town ain't nothing but a bunch of jackedup scab pickers. Yeah, we'll see what you're calling us after I bury a couple of bar down wristers. Halfclapper, top cheddar. Biscuits top titties, bar downskies. Always bar downskie. Pull out the guns. Safetys off. Fuckin' safety off, boys. A little threeononeskie? A little threeontwoskie? Hum a high hard one. Hit the red light district. You won't make it that far, slugger. You either, champ. Buckets off. Center ice. Puck drop. Shed 'em. Go me. A little fuck me, fuck you. Free nose jobs. Let's dance. Let's hit the dfloor. My balls dangle harder than you, boy. Like I thought, bad case of the Native flu. Devon, we're missing $2000. Really? It's a devastating blow to Menergy Spa, I know. Hey, I'll call Stewart. He'll fix everything. Hello? Stewart? Hey, Devon. Hey, we're missing 2k. Yeah, I took it for the rave. 2k? I don't think you understand. It's going to be a massive production. It's gonna be like an. Aurora Borealisthemed Salvador Dali drug orgy with shamans. But that's a lot of money. No time, I gotta go. Wayne. Daryl. Gailor, how are ya now? I'm on a juice cleanse. Haven't had a drink in three days. Had close to 30 shits, though. So what's the fuss? Well, timing's right for your new business. Saw it up on your fuckin' Facebook, there. Got a skunk sleeping underneath us, right now. Did you not know skunks are immune to bee stings? They even teach their babies how to raid beehives. And? Well, they burrow up for the winter, and rip farts on each other to keep warm. No way. Oh, yeah. They go to mate as soon as they leave their mom, so you know they're probably thinking about her during sex. That or their brothers and sisters which is even more inappropriate. Oh. There's one knocking. Make way. Well, pitterpatter. Can you take this one, please? Here's the deal. Stewart's rave is eating up all our money, and the business is failing without his expertise. We simply aren't making enough coin selling the Native's cigarettes. We need the meth. Menergy Spa is never going to happen at this rate. I officially move to boycott Stewart's rave, take it off our fuckin' Facebooks and sabotage it. All in favor say, Aye!. Aye! It's unanimous. How are we going to do this? We could put something on our Facebooks. We could say the Ag Hall has asbestos. Yes, asbestos. Everyone hates asbestos. Asbestos is the answer. Okay. Let's do that. Maybe you don't say asbestos anymore, though. Okay. Hey, Katy, you look beautiful. You look better. Um. I've come to cordially invite you to my rave tonight. Stewart. Fuck, greasiest skid I ever seen. Criss Angel mindfreak lookingmotherfucker. What are you thinking holding a rave at the Ag Hall? I'm thinking I'm doing the Agricultural Society a huge favor. You guys are going broke. Tits up or not, it's inappropriate. Why not the Legion? Or even upstairs at the arena? Or the fuckin' youth center. Because they're too small, shirttucker. Be prepared, because once this blows up they'll probably ask me to do it quarterly. Biweekly! Mmmhmm. Mmmhmm. We'll see if it blows up then. It'll probably be pretty tough to find me through the crowd. Stage security will be pretty tight but your name's on the guest list, and there's a backstage pass with your name on it. I'll do my best to make it down, Stewart. My ass. And just as a heads up, it is a rave, so there will probably be people on drugs. You know, MDMA. What? There's gonna be MDMA at the Ag Hall? Yes, there will be MDMA at my rave at the Ag Hall. There will be MDMA, DMT, PCP, LSD, LED and probably UFC. But I am clean and sober. You are spare parts, aren't you, bud? I truly hope to see you there. Watch your fuckin' hands, skid. Three, two. Fuckin' skids are turning Letterkenny into a gong show, buddy. Fucking gonger, buddy. I'm rattled about that meth chirp, brotein. Fuckin' Stewart, bro. Fuckin' Stewart, bro. There's fuckin' two in that pud, hey, boys? Put 'em away like a winter coat, boys. What the fuck was that? That was garbage. That was fuckin' pedestrian. All this beaking is kiddie pool shit. Is that what you want? Riley, Jonesy? Huh? You want to get dropped off at the splash pad on the way home, eh? Get mom and dad to pick you up after you all swim? No running on the deck, ya fuckin' pheasants. Fuck! Bag skate. Tomorrow, 00 a. m. Fuckin' embarrassing!. Hey, give your balls a tug, you titfucker! Fuck! You never looked so good. You never felt so good. I'm so proud of you, man. Save me a dance, Wayne. You look better. Where's Stewart, buddy? Where is he, bro? Rave's canceled. Go home. Bullshit, buddy. That's not what the poster says, buddy. I said, it's fuckin' canceled. Now quit your hollering before I get cross. Hey. When he give a warning, he don't repeat it. Yeah. Seven of us and two of you. It's a good time for a donnybrook, boys. Tilly time, boys. What the fuck are you pheasants doing out here? It's 10 minutes to curfew. You think you can dog fuck all night and then dance? Dog fuckin' means no dancin'. Get home! It's fuckin' embarrassing. Well, pitterpatter. This isn't over. Jinx, you owe me a Coke. Christ. McMurray. MCMURRAY : Wayne, I've been told the rave was a bust. Something about an asbestos scare or something. No one showed up. Sister Bonnie, though, she's still in there. About that dance you were going to save her. She'll be in a sort of golden poppy progressive onesie. Either way, you know, get in there, pal. Give 'er the guts. Okay. Bang the very guts right out of her. Okay. Just have at her, bud, like. The nutsack. Alley oop. This is a grotesquerie. It's off. We are going to make Letterkenny the biggest meth town in the whole country. I love Stewart! You were out gettin' good with your pals the other night. It's been so long since I've had a pair of tits in my hands, I popped a lap rocket opening up a can of tuna last Sunday morning. Oh, that's offputting. Not to old Gail, it isn't. I'd love to hear your big bang theory, Daniel. Ew. Print it. This is officially me callin' down for more mayo. That's clever. Do you like magic? Pop that purple home wrecker over here. I'll make her disappear. We should just be out there just pole vaultin' around town, boys. Wouldn't say no to a bit of toe curlin' and I don't mean maybe. It won't be long before you have the option. College and university kids will be home for the summer next week. Well, that should help your spring fever. Which is a serious condition if not handled appropriately. Miniskirt and Tbar season. Yup. By all means, ladies. Express yourselves. Go easy down there, Squirrely Dan. I suffered severely from the spring fever last year, had to go into full cougar mode with an 18yearold. Oh? May have been my second cousin. Oh. It was either that or be at home flickin' it to Grapefruit League baseball highlights. You know they're all gonna be in here lookin' for a bit of How's your father? Make sure your game is tight or you'll be home firing wristers. Firing what? Oh. What say we make this interesting. Whichever one of you grabs a tail first gets 50 bucks off their bar tab. In. That is a Texas sized 104. No, you two get after it. Here's a tip. When the gettin's good around here, stay close to your pal Wayne. Kid's got more spunk than a hotel room hand towel. Well, here's a tip. Don't fart in a spacesuit. Here's a tip. Don't sneeze when you're taking a piss. Here's a tip. It's really hard to get tuna out of your dick hole. This place is about to be crawling with snapper. Let's hope this is the last night you'll be going home to make a bald man puke. You naturally prefer companionship, but I guess there's a lot worse things than playing a little one man couch hockey in the dark. Wearing number 22 for the Tackville Tornados. Who fuckin' cares. Dig deep, bare down, you fuckin' hero. You're my fuckin' hero, twotwo. Nice flow, you fuckin' donkey. Take a lap. Hey, give your balls a tug, you tit fucker! What the fuck are you lookin' at, twos, huh? You lookin' at my cock, you fuckin' sally? Mix in some class, you fuckin' cock looker! You're a fuckin' cock looker, twotwo! Hey, shut the fuck up. You're a fuckin' hero, twos. Fuckin' suck at hockey, twotwo! Loser. Ever wonder why Katy doesn't come watch us play anymore, bud? Makes no fuckin' sense, buddy. Just fuckin' stud army born to go silky shelf. Silky studs. I mean Italian silk. Just rippin' ched. Just chuckin' mitts and suckin' tits. Tossin' mitties, suckin' titties. Just look at the snipers up there. Here to support the boys. Must be nice Ferda. Ferda. It'd be pretty sick to see Katy up there again. So sick. Atta be sures, eh? First thirsty Thursday of the season, boys. How's team morale? I'm most excited for Buck Hunter. Boy, I'm gonna tell ya that's what I'm gonna do, holy fuck. You guys know if Gail's making pickled eggs or pickled sausages? Bear in mind there is no wrong answer to this question. I'm gonna be posting up and looking for love, and I don't care who knows it. Don't set the bar too high, mutant. That's fair. You guys going to be wearing belts? Hard no. Why don't you guys wear belts? 'Cause we buy pants that fucking fit. Why would I buy a piece of leather that costs $25, when I have a perfectly good skate lace at home? $25? No. Fucking $25, you're lucky to have a $25 bill. Fuck, you've been to Winners lately? You're talking about $35, $45. Winners. Slow down there, Mr. Rocketfeller. I go down to the flea market at St. Jacobs, $25 could get you at least five belts. Plus, a commemorative belt buckle says, Jesus holds up my pants. For Sunday morning. Boy, howdy. Ten losses in a row, bro. Two's a streak, bro. Like where the fuck Schultzy been out there? Schultzy's dog shit. Soupy's a plug. Smitty's a pile. Millsy. Cartsy. Burnsy. Deetzy. Brooksy. Brooksy's got a herndog. Seridog? He's having offseason surgery for a sports herndog. He's out four to six. Four to six for. Best plan. Where's Coopsy been? Playing like poopsy. Playing like Milan Poocic. P. K. Pooban. And Ryan Poogent Hopkins. Pookka Rask. The brothers Miko and Saku Koipoo. Joke, bro. It's embarrassing. Katy! How come you don't watch us play anymore? 'Cause you're dog shit. We're not dog shit. I mean, the boys are dog shit. But we're pretty good. Is that why they always play and you guys never do? She might be onto something there, bro. Not seeing a whole lot of special teams time, buddy. I haven't killed a penalty all year. I mean, we wanna score goals, but we'd just end up killing them boys. Mmmhmm. Would you come watch if we play a regular shift? Duh. The fuck else am I going to do around here? Time to set up a meeting with the Coach. Buhdoo! We're the biggest Pantene pros in the league. Mix in some big minutes for a couple stick and pucksters. You guys don't give a shit about winning. You just like the hockey player lifestyle. You are posers. So what are we gonna do?. You need to get in shape! Study the tape! Play with some intensity! Hold my spitter. So basically what you are saying is. We're at this level. But we've got to get to this level. Done! You're a fucking beauty. Registered beautician. What do you guys think of the program? Well. Uh. Just kidding, I don't give a fuck. Gutty. Yeah, a little gutty. That's a little gutty. Fuck. That's when you cut off her balls. Cut off her balls? Correct. I think you mean, Cut off his balls.. Incorrect. Oh, no? Oh, yes. That is why you never give a sword to a hooker. Hey, Wayne. How many planets are there?. Well, with the whole Pluto debate. Give or take, eight planets. There'll only be seven after I destroy Uranus. Buy you a drink? Okay. Who's that?. Who? Kyle Schneidstiller's sister?. Is that who she is? That's Kyle Schneidstiller's little sister. You know, he's a decent dude. She's finer than frog hair. Have an eye for the fertility, boys. She's been knockedup twice. She's a oneshot Sally. Also. She dated Boots for a little while before he went to jail. You guys ever hear anything about that guy fucking an ostrich? No. The Ginger fucked an ostrich. Allegedly. It would take more than one guy to fuck an ostrich. We've heard that it was a sick ostrich. Well, it would take two guys to fuck an ostrich. Three even. Again, we're hearing it was a sick ostrich. Still, it's a threeman job to fuck one. But wait. Was that before or after he dated Kyle Schneidstiller's sister? Oh, it's almost not worth thinkin' about. Oh, we have an eye. She's sweet on you, Dary. Is that what she is? That's your next sweetie right there. Go talk to her. What's your logic there? You see what she's doing with her hair? That's called a hair show. When a gal's sweet on a guy, and she wants to get his attention, she just starts fucking with her hair whole bunch. What for? So you notice more about the way they look. Like how her face is framed with her hair up or down. And also make you think like. Well, I wouldn't wanna touch it. Well, yeah, I think I would like to touch it. Well, get after it. But don't lead with the touchin', though. All right. I will. Just, not just yet. Maybe after a couple. There. Okay, bro, workout program. Go. Gotta start with burpees, buddy. Just ripping burpee boxshums, buddy. 50 burpees, 50 pushups. 50 burpees, 50 pushups. Stairs. Protein break. Just ripping skull crashers. Just rippin' forced reps. Forced rep super sets. Bird up. Just rippin' antigravity press. Just rippin' Advanced Kettlebell Windmill. Just rippin' barbell halfsquats. Just rippin' drop sets. Just rippin' Swiss ball jackknifes. Just rippin' silly animal stack. Just rippin' bent over rear delt raise with head on bench. Fuckin' delts to die for, buddy. Just rippin' cable rope overhead tricep extensions. #Noexcuses. #Beachbody. Legs? Hate doing legs. Let's skip leg day. That's the best asswash of your life right there, boys. Good work, Shoresy. Look at the hustle on, Shoresy. Best asswash of your life. Ooh. Scored a perfect score in the bonus round. Don't think I've ever seen that before. Remember what happened here today. You can't forget something like that. Seen Angie in here with her new boyfriend again a couple nights ago. Oh, who gives a care. Remember I told you he was in a '94 Jeep YJ with a wave decal on the side? He made an upgrade. Short trip. Pulled in here with a 2003 aquamarine Audi wagon with a magenta Fear this sticker on the back. Ain't no reason to get excited. Came in here wearing a pair of Fandango pink pastel khakis with a white, gold leather chain fuckin' wallet, and a Creed Tshirt on. Remarkable. I know. He had a deep carrot orange fedora with a burnt orange stripe and a little cauliflower blue feather with a fucking, I don't know, looked like to me some kind of a blackbearded titmouse or some kind of shit. Did you know there's a type of bird called a Bushtit? I did not. It's a type of chickadee. He also had an imperial purple. That'll do, McMurray. Oh, I'm just sayin' it must suck balls to lose to a fucking douchebag like that. Hi. Heard you doin' all right at Buck Hunter. What say I give you a quick squeezer in the parking lot there, eh? Could be worse. Could indeed. There a vet around here, ladies? These puppies are sick. Christ, I would snort her dandruff. Dandruff is a fungus. I think you mean you'd sniff her flakes. Then you are giving me far too much credit, my boy. Oh, oh. Lookin' some comely tonight there, big fella. Do you wanna know what, Gail? I think you've got a case of the spring fever. Can I get you a drink? Okay. You see that one? She's like a Middle Eastern rebel army. 'Cause there's a political uprising in my pants. Well, shoulders back. Here she comes. Excuse me, boys. She's sweet on you. Get after it. You think so? You see what she just did? Touched your back and then, moved on? That's called the unnecessary squeezeby. Is that what it's called? Mmmhmm. You noticed she had about half a fuckin' soccer field to get past but instead leaned in close, got a bit handsy like there was only a tiny lane to get by? The unnecessary squeezeby. Go talk to her. Let's fire back a couple of shots first. Well, this is swiftly becoming a counterproductive practice, but okay. Look at Coopsy out there. Just dog shit. You mean Claude Girpoo? Roberto Pooongo. I mean, look at you. You're fuckin' Kenny coasttocoast out there, buddy. You're Harry HighSock buddy. Cory clap bombs. Thank you. Sniper. Snipe! Didn't your coach tell you to get in shape? It's our cheat day. We'll be rippin' silly plyometrics right after this so they cancel each other out. Then it's arms. Just rippin' concentration curls. Just rippin' cross body hammer curls. Just rippin' alternate dumbbell bicep curls. Just rippin' lying close grip bar curl on high pulley. Just rippin' alternate onearm dumbbell preacher curls. Just rippin' standing onearm bicep curl over incline bench. You're an idiot. We're smokebombing over to throw some weights around now. You wanna come? Okay. Ninja dust. Resistance training! Muscle atrophy! Take some snaps of us, snipe. Yeah, take some snaps for our Facebooks, snipey! Take your shirts off. Tarps off, boys. Sheddin' tarp, boys. Take a knee, boys. Grab a knee boys. Those betablockers really helped you up your explosive potential, bro. Muscular endurance, muscular strength, bro. Really working those fasttwitch muscle fibers, buddy. Isokinetic exercise to really test your lactic threshold, buddy. You're never gonna plateau with that overload principle, buddy. Rate of perceived exertion. You really hit your target heart rate with vigorous intensity. Thanks, buddy.  So? We got in shape and studied the tape. You gonna come watch us play with intensity tomorrow? Yeah, I could do that. Wheel, snipe, celly, boys! Fuckin' dangles, boys! Ninja dust. Hi. Hmm? How are you now? Good and you? Not so bad. Um. Do you know where the washroom is? Sure, just right back there. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. And I'm Jessica. Wayne. I know. Now tell me you saw that. What? She's givin' me the big eyes. Is that what she was doing? Big eyes? You know, when a gal's sweet on a dude and she's shorter than him? Instead of tilting her neck up to look at him, she'll just keep her head straight and look up with her eyes. Like puppy dog eyes. It's like. Do you know where the washroom is? Versus. Do you know where the washroom is? Okay. Yeah. Big eyes. Wayne, she's still giving you the big eyes. Well, don't have to tell me twice. It's about time one of you showed some finish. She's so hot I'd jerk off her dad just to see where she came from. Who? Jivin' Pete? No. That's her dad. Jivin' Pete. Jivin' Pete. Yeah. Got his nuts are all bunned up after a donkey kicked him. Ruptured the hydrocele. One of them swole up to look like a ripe avocado. Other one looks like a peach pit. I'll get him to show it to you. He'll show to just about anybody when he's drunk. Either way, whole unit's more cauliflowered than a UFC fighter's ear. Nice, nice penalty kill, boys. I love the hustle! Love the hustle! Look at that hustle, eh? Well, piece of shit. Who brought the fuckin' rocket, boys? TEAMMATE. Holy fuck, boys. Who's billet sister's a fuckin' rocket? TEAMMATE. She's a fuckin' rocket. I got a fucking rocket in my pants, right now. TEAMMATE. Hey, dibs on digis, boys. TEAMMATE. Already dibs'd digits, buddy. No, I dibs'd her in warm up, you were throwin' sauce at the blue line. I was dibsing digis. Who the fuck you dibs 'em to? TEAMMATE. A dibs is a dibs is a dibs, buddy. Who gives a shit. If a dibs falls in the forest and there's no one around to hear it, is it still a dibs? Well, fuck, yeah, buddy! Fuck, no, buddy! Give your balls a tug, you tit fucker! Wake up, you fuckin' pheasants!. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wake up, you mutants. You're missing out on all the girls who do not want to have sex with you. Awfully pedestrian effort from our boys tonight, Katy. No discount on bar tabs tonight, Chester and Charlie! What was your problem, big shoots? He did all right. Didn't you, Wayne? He spent some time in the bathroom with a little blonde spinner who had such a butt on her. I took one look at it and I thought, Jesus Christ, woman, you shit with that ass? Attaboy! Boys! Sniper. Snipe!. Gotta say, I had a fucking hoot at the game. Two fights. Hockey players have the nicest asses. Okay, we don't want you coming anymore. Too distracting for the boys. Ferda. Ferda. What? Uh. It's too distracting. For the boys. Yeah, no, I heard you. I heard you say that I'm a distraction. Okay. Well, guess I'll have to find one of your teammates to dibs my digits. But we dibs'd those digis! You did a decent job with these dgens tonight. Thank you, Gail. I said decent. You forgot the most important thing. Don't get so drunk you couldn't use it even if you had the option. Mmmhmm. I'll tell you what and I'll only tell you once. You've got the pick of the litter around here so you may as well get pickin'. I've got this fifty bucks and no one to claim it. What say we put it in your jeans and see what else is hangin' around in there while we're at it? No. Like what's in your jeans, big fella? Nothin'. I mean it. Cripes, I may not go down in history, but I'll go down on you. Okay. You want to do 68? I'll help you clean up. You'll go down on me? And I'll owe you one. Where's that rag? There it is. Wake up, big shoots and really big shoots. More hands make less work. Call me cake! 'Cause I go straight to your ass, cowboy. There's cake? No. A pack of coyotes come right up the back porch the other night, 'cause your dog's in heat and you know those fuckin' yellow eyed bastards will go right through the screen door if they're horny. Look like you're goin' to a formal with that top button done up to 11. Oh, it's not like I'm gonna be one of those nut sacks, sitting around getting sucked on by skeeters all day. Come off it. Well. Pitter patter. Let's get at 'er. Sixty bucks per dead coyote ain't gonna collect itselfs. I think I'll have a bumper dump before we get started. Oh, I don't give a care. You ever had a bumper dump? It's not polite to talk about. Though I do gotta piss goddamn bad. When you have a dump, leaning up against the back of the bumper of your machine. So, it's pretty near like it sounds then. You ever have a stump hump? You know, I think I did, but. I can't remember. It's when you have sex. With a girl? Yeah, with a girl. Bent over a stump of a tree. My friend said he had sex inside a hollowed log one time and I thought, Why, I bet Fred Penner pulled that off one time, too. This right here, perfect stump for a stump hump. I should say. Wayne? Dary. Come over here and join me for a sec. Oh, well fuckin'. Like fuckin' why? It appears somebody's been growing marijuana in your back bush. You left the barn door open after chores one time and your dad thought you were stoned. But you haven't smoked the electric lettuce since grade eight. That's a mitt full of Johnny Red Eye, all right. I think it's only appropriate we call the cops. Just take about 20% off 'er over there, mixed berry. Don't be such a sally. You know how much shit needs doin' around here? Well, shit needs so much doin' really. The produce stand is a fuckin' shanty. If we sell this stuff, we can make thousands. I know a guy on the reserve. I don't know. Why not? It's 'cause. Just kidding. We don't give a fuck. If the cops come around here, people will talk. Don't want people talkin'. Call your guy. Hello, Tanis. You know the deal. Personal use only. If I hear about yous turning around and selling them, and I will hear about it, we're gonna have a hell of a problem. Here's your smokes. Dime a dart. Dime a dart. Buck a dart. Buck a dart. They're fuckin' ya. Buck a dart. Buck a dart. They're fuckin' us. I've got some photos here. Of the goins' on. You gonna be upset if you keep scrolling to the left, dog. You gonna see some shit that you don't wanna see. This is a big crop. Whoever planted it, has done a lot of sneaking around and maintaining it so well. We're busy enough keeping the worm pickers off the property. There's nothing like good outdoor grown. It's 5k worth and ready for harvesting. You pull it out of the ground, I'll pick it up. Cash deal. Deal. Who is this?. That's Tanis, my daughter. Should say estranged, I suppose. What's so stranged about her? I'll tell you, if you find yourselves in her way, you oughtta swiftly get out of it. Give me a minute. So, how about it, boys? Can always count on old KatyKat. You delivered. I'll give you that. But what type of prick doesn't stand up and shake another man's hand? About Tanis. What about her? I think I'm sweet on her. Yeah? What for, Dary? What for. Dary, you don't need to explain. She makes your dick hard, get after it. We'll worry about that later. Work on the produce stand starts today. Still waiting for you to say. Thank you. For being a djen with a drug dealer. Now, if you ever hit me and I find out about it. That's good, Jonesy. No more kids table with the big boy moves like that, huh? You guys ready to play like big boys yet, huh? Maybe pick out your own outfits in the morning? Make your own snacks? Some solo back to school shopping? It's fuckin' embarrassing! Good news is, Pee Wee secondary team just canceled their ice time. I think we can make good use of it, huh? Suit up, pheasants. Another hour of the fun stuff on deck. Might as well bring your puke buckets with ya. You fuckin' newbies! Hey, schmelt. What the fuck's wrong with you? Nothing, why? Are you fucked up right now? Me? Yes, you! Are you on meth right now?. Oh, my God. This is unsee 'er, bro. Got that fuck, buddy. If we don't fucking do it, no one else is going to. The writing's on the wall, bro. Hey, give your balls a tug you tit fucker. Not the right time, Schwarzy! How did this happen, bro? We don't know any dusters that do meth and now the fuckin' rookie? Well, we do know Stewart and Devon and all those skids. But that's it, buddy. You know, I heard that Ginger and Boots used to do that shit. And look where it got them, schmelt! My buddy Royze had a bad stint for a while, now that I think about it, buddy. But that's cause Royze was hangin' out with Tolzy and that guy's a fuckin' pigeon. My buddy Parkzy too. I guess Belzy was fucked up for a while. And he got Welzy into it. Yeah, Belzy and Welzy were doing it with Carzy and his billet sister. Carzy and his billet sister got Colzy fucked up once. Wait, isn't Colzy still fucked up, bro? Only when he's with Kitzy and Burzy, bro. Colzy is always with Kitzy and Burzy. Well, Colzy, Kitzy and Burzy are always with Carzy and his billet sister, buddy. Who are always with Belzy and Welzy. Letterkenny is a meth town. We're gonna go see the skids. We're gonna go. We're gonna do it? Do you wanna do it? You want one? Let's do it! Give me one! We're gonna have one. Give me it. We're going. Let's go then! Let's go! Better buy all the smokes. What is this? This is where I ruin your life. Hang on. No, no, no. You hang on. All right? Yous ripped me off. And I'm fuckin' pissed. But. We can make it right. As unPC as this market may be, it's pretty lucrative, so. If you sell the rest of the cigarettes at a buck a dart, we get ninety cents, you get ten. Deal. Deal. No! No deal. I spent all our money at that rave. You're gonna step on some toes in any business venture. It's inevitable. If we want to take this meth business to the next level, we cannot part with any more coin. Are you with me? Always. Let's get this over with then. You guys wanna dance? Let's do this. We can do this, too. Is that how you think this works? You just take a beating and then we're square? Bunch of basics. Yous been watching the wrong movies, boys. Mmmmmm! Pay attention. This isn't just about us anymore, all right? This is about everyone now. Your friends, your families. Until we get paid, they all suffer. Let's go. Let the burning of Letterkenny begin. Gotta say, fellas, this is coming together nicely. I might actually spend some time out here now. With some fuckin' clothes on? Not my forte. Unfortunate. You brings us sustenance while we are hard at work, Katy. That's what I appreciates about you. Is that what you appreciate about me? Go easy, squirrely Dan. Thank you. Your sister's hot, Wayne. There, I said it. I said it! I regret nothing. I regret nothing! Too fat to run. Fuckin' Stewart. Fuckin' skids. Where the fuck is this kid? Fuckin' hate this kid. Fuckin' wreck this kid. Fuckin' kill this kid. No, no. Just get 'em. Yeah. We'll hurt 'em. Yeah. No, it's a metaphor. Yeah, I get it. Yeah. Hey, but then we're here for donnybrook, not him and his buddies, buddy. Oh, fuck. We don't necessarily need to wait for them to get here to wreck the meth lab, buddy. We can just fuckin' wreck right now. True. Dibs on Devon, bro. Jonesy, I don't even wanna discuss dibs right now. No discussion on dibs? Buddy, we'll fuckin' get 'em all. Oh, yeah, okay, let's get 'em all. Let's fucking do it, buddy. It's already trashed. I'm not quite sure how I feel about this, buddy. Bit anticlimactic. Isn't it, buddy? Yeah. Shit! Wonder who smashed up his place, bro. Fuckin' long hair don't care, bro. We find the skids and have that fuckin' donnybrook, buddy. Buckets off? Fuckin' rip over there and just conflict. Fight. Injure. Kill. Ball up and bang out, bud. Bust on. Bust up. Download the scrap app. Pugnacity. Truculence. Burkie. Little squabble. Little quibble. Smackdown! Spar. Spat. Schism. We are at this level! But we need to get to this level! That's a lotta weed. Sorry about what happened here. Know about the beef? What beef? Between your meth pals and my daughter. Two things. One, no one who does meth is a pal of mine for fuck's sake. Two, what are you talking about? She was ripped off on a cigarette transaction by some fellas from Letterkenny. And then? She's owed money by someone from your town. She's gonna make it everyone's problem. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news. Hope this serves as some sort of consolation. Count it if you like. She won't stop until she gets what's owed. When Tanis comes back to collect, she won't be short staffed. Us neither. Fuckin' skids!. Predictable! Predictable! Is this little soiree for us? And you missed to a better one at the Ag Hall last weekend. You should have come. You gave the rookie meth, idiot. First one's free. You fuckin' turned Letterkenny into a war zone. Got us labeled as a meth town, idiot. So, what are you gonna do about it? Idiot. Buckets off. Fuckin' go time. Shed 'em. Go me! A little fuck me, fuck you? MAN. Free fuckin' nose jobs? MAN. Let's dance. MAN. Hit the dfloor. My balls dangle harder than you. Yeah, sounds familiar. This is what we've been waiting for. Hey! It's time. You got our money? Nay! We do not have, nor will we ever have, a dime for you. And you took away our only source of income when you trashed our meth lab! We're all here. So, uh. It's combat, let's proceed. Power stop, Tanis. We got dibs on the donnybrook with the skids. What's a dibs? A dibs is a dibs is a dibs. Hey! Pipe down, shit head. You don't get it, do you? This is about the money. So, until we get the money, Letterkenny will continue to burn. All right? How are you now? Good, and you? Deadly. Is that. The Ginger and Boots. Those two guys fucked an ostrich. Just the Ginger fucked an ostrich. Allegedly. Mmmmmm. It would take like two people to fuck an ostrich. Three even. It was a sick ostrich. Allegedly. You're fucking ruthless for bringing a couple dudes like that here. In his defense. He's usually not the type of prick I am. If they fucked an ostrich, what else have they fucked? Just the Ginger fucked an ostrich. Allegedly. I ask again. If they fucked an ostrich, what else have they fucked? It's almost not worth thinkin' about. Okay, speak. Yous got ripped off. It's too bad that happened. And? And it's none of my business. Till it was my business. Now, we could beat the fuck outta yous right here. And mark my words, one day, we'll get ya. But that doesn't solve our problem here. Dary. Your name's Dary? It's Daryl. That's just something my friends call me sometimes. We gotta put the damage you're doing around Letterkenny to bed. That's 5k. What are you's owed?. More than that. We're tough fuckin' sleddin'! Hey. We're gonna call it 5k. Is that what we're gonna do? We are. You're gonna take it and leave Letterkenny. And if yous come back for so much as to pump your gas. When he gives a warning, he don't repeat it. We'll get ya. Deal. Beats fighting an ostrich fucker. All right, can we, uh, part the hick sea here? Uh, actually wait. I got to know. This has gotta sting a little bit, right?. I mean, you're short, you're ugly, you're incompetent, you're fuckin' broke! Fuckin' A. You're a fuckin' addict, you're hopeless. Yeah. I mean you are such a tragedy that even all these people here who hate you, will bail you out, just so they can. What's the word? Erase you. My cousin was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and he works at a fuckin' bank. What's your fucking excuse? That'll do, Tanis. Hey! I'm not talking to you. Look at you. You got bloodshot eyes, runny nose, fuckin' greasy hair, scabs everywhere. What is that? What's that, right there? You see that? Is that cum? Dried cum on your fuckin' zipper? I'm so sorry. Oh, you are pointless. I bet, the second you popped out, your mom wished she had a sewn up snapper. Probably would've been better if you grew to a sickly size inside the womb and killed the both of you before you fuckin' rolled out and started fucking up. Bitch. What? I'll tell you what's gotta sting a little bit. Well, fuckin' get after it, then!. Well, Who would've 'thunk it. Fuck. Mmmhmm. That was a top tier sucker, Riley. You too, Jonesy. Thanks boys. I'd sucker you guys in your sleep. Still. Makes my top three suckers, boys. An A1 box shot, you fuckin' barbarian. Never claimed to be a lady. Did you stop and smoke a joint for a bit and then jump right back in there? Nectar of gods, fellas. On the house. All right!. Well at this rate, we'll need another one soon, Gail. You know, I gotta say, I'm looking forward to a bit of peace and quiet around here. Hear, hear. There ain't no reason to get excited, am I right? Yup. Yeah. All right. Who the fuck is the toughest guy in here? That'd be me.
