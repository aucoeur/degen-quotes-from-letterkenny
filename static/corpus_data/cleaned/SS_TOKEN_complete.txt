<STOP> <START> Negative. <STOP> <START> It's when you have a friend call 10, 15 minutes into a date to be sure the date isn't a total bust. <STOP> <START> And if it is, then you can play the phone call as though it's an emergency and leave the date. <START> Well, that's fair. <STOP> <START> I guess we are first cousin to an emergency here. <STOP> <START> A good one. <STOP> <START> And you shouldn't be afraid of it. <STOP> <START> I think we could do good things here. <STOP> <START> I'm going to call my friend and cancel her pending emergency call, and when I get back, let's talk about your feelings, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Let's really talk about them. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> I wanna take 'em, and I wanna talk about them. <STOP> <START> Oh, it's <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> How are you now?

<STOP> <START> You don't. <STOP> <START> Speak. <STOP> <START> Do not approach. <STOP> <START> Seen Katy around? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> That is all. <STOP> <START> Stewart! <STOP> <START> Trouble in paradise? <STOP> <START> If there was, she wouldn't know it. <STOP> <START> I'm not talking to her. <START> Well played. <START> Wait it out. <STOP> <START> That way she'll come to the conclusion that you're upset with her and ask you why. <STOP> <START> Precisely. <STOP> <START> She should anyway. <STOP> <START> If she's smart. <STOP> <START> I know. <START> Why are you mad at her? <STOP> <START> She acts like. <STOP> <START> You should try an open relationship. <STOP> <START> Could be productive. <STOP> <START> You could also try a hall pass. <STOP> <START> It's when you give, you know, her being allowed to sleep with one person and that's it, no questions asked. <STOP> <START> Another plausibly fruitful option. <STOP> <START> New GTA and COD out today. <START> We're going to sesh. <STOP> <START> Been gaming much?

<STOP> <START> Not so bad. <START> Well, I guess the teddy's out of the tickle trunk on this one, too. <STOP> <START> I also work here. <STOP> <START> Reason is the Salty Treat blew out an amp the other day, rockin' out pretty hard to some Lifehouse covers, which will happen. <STOP> <START> So, I'm pickin' up the slack. <STOP> <START> I'm happy to do it. <START> Way she goes. <STOP> <START> I'm Lisa. <STOP> <START> Are you ever. <STOP> <START> Look at you! <STOP> <START> It's America's little sweetheart over here. <STOP> <START> You're like a little Katy Heigl or like a little Katy Hudson. <START> What can I get ya? <STOP> <START> Do you have cookies and cream? <STOP> <START> Do I. <STOP> <START> Do I have cookies and cream? <STOP> <START> I sure do have cookies and cream. <STOP> <START> And I'm thinkin' maybe a vanillafudge swirl chunk for Mr. <STOP> <START> Newman over here? <STOP> <START> That'll do, thank you. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> And you're gonna keep an eye on little Caty Blanchett here for me till I get back? <STOP> <START> Sure will. <STOP> <START> Thank you! <STOP> <START> Be right back! <STOP> <START> So, you're a farmer, <START> Wayne? <STOP> <START> Can confirm. <STOP> <START> You don't smell like one. <STOP> <START> I'm kidding. <STOP> <START> I'm a preschool principal. <STOP> <START> Do you like kids? <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> I know, everyone likes kids. <STOP> <START> They're so silly. <STOP> <START> I love them when they're silly. <STOP> <START> But if they get too silly, they have to come see me. <STOP> <START> Silly? <STOP> <START> Mischief. <STOP> <START> Trouble. <START> We use gentler terms. <STOP> <START> As a policy. <START> Well, so what happens when they come see you? <START> Well, we do things a little differently in our program. <STOP> <START> The approach is progressive and positive. <START> We issue a hug consent form to parents, which allows us to hug their kids. <STOP> <START> Because 99% of the time, all kids need is a hug. <STOP> <START> A hug? <STOP> <START> A squeeze. <START> Well, you squeeze 'em. <STOP> <START> An embrace. <STOP> <START> Oh. <STOP> <START> Oh? <START> Well. <START> What is it? <STOP> <START> Nothin'. <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Yeah? <STOP> <START> Speak freely. <STOP> <START> No, I'd better not. <STOP> <START> That's the only way we'll get to know each other. <STOP> <START> But do you ever smack 'em? <STOP> <START> Excuse me? <STOP> <START> Like, give 'em a good whack? <STOP> <START> I don't follow. <STOP> <START> Do you ever hit the kid? <STOP> <START> Like, for being too silly. <STOP> <START> No! <START> Wayne. <START> We never hit our kids. <STOP> <START> You shouldn't hit kids. <START> Well, you know what, don't you remember how scared you were of your principal when you were growing up? <STOP> <START> It's 'cause he'd smack you if you were being too silly. <STOP> <START> Like your parents wanted you to have a principal who would smack you. <STOP> <START> They took comfort in the fact that they were sending you to a place every day where someone would smack you for them if you were being too silly. <STOP> <START> And sometimes I see kids these days, I kind of think, like. <STOP> <START> Like, wish you could still do that. <STOP> <START> That sort of discipline is long outdated, <START> Wayne, and frowned upon. <START> We sit the child down. <STOP> <START> That's another problem. <START> What is? <STOP> <START> In my opinion. <STOP> <START> Sitting? <START> Well, no wonder kids are failin' school, just sittin' around all day. <STOP> <START> Stand up, you're not doing nothin'. <STOP> <START> You think sitting is a problem? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <START> Why? 'Cause it makes you soft. <STOP> <START> Literally or figuratively? <START> Well, both, I suppose. <STOP> <START> Both? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> In my opinion. <STOP> <START> My phone's buzzing. <START> Well, so you like cookies and cream ice cream, hey? <START> Well, I think it's pretty good, too. <STOP> <START> Hi, Michelle. <STOP> <START> Oh, no. <STOP> <START> Okay, I'll be right there. <STOP> <START> I'm sorry, <START> Wayne, I've gotta go. <STOP> <START> It's. <STOP> <START> An emergency. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> It's <START> Wayne. <START> Well, how are you now? <STOP> <START> Oh, not so bad. <STOP> <START> Yeah, this one's too soft. <START> What? <STOP> <START> I'm not talking to you. <STOP> <START> Super. <STOP> <START> It's been three days. <START> Why haven't you asked me what's wrong? <STOP> <START> Something wrong? <STOP> <START> Of course it is. <STOP> <START> You act like I don't. <STOP> <START> Should I have known that? <STOP> <START> It's called the silent treatment. <STOP> <START> Step one, I stop talking to you. <STOP> <START> Step two, you form the conclusion that something is wrong. <STOP> <START> Step three, you ask me what's wrong. <START> What's up with step one? <STOP> <START> You've skipped step one and two. <START> What's step three again? <STOP> <START> You ask me what's wrong! <STOP> <START> Got it. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> You bet. <STOP> <START> Go ahead. <START> Where? <STOP> <START> Step three. <START> What's step three again? <START> We'll skip step three. <STOP> <START> I'm just going to tell you what's wrong. <STOP> <START> That should have been step one. <START> Wrong. <STOP> <START> Step one and two are fundamental steps. <STOP> <START> You missed steps, Stewart. <STOP> <START> How? <STOP> <START> Step one, become angry with someone. <STOP> <START> Step two, tell that someone that you're angry. <STOP> <START> Step three, resolve anger with that someone. <STOP> <START> Step four. <STOP> <START> Step four. <STOP> <START> Step four, resume peaceful existence. <STOP> <START> Your logic is frighteningly bewitching. <STOP> <START> Phantasmagoric. <STOP> <START> It's time for you to go. <START> What? <START> Where? <STOP> <START> Leave here? <STOP> <START> It was a rebound. <STOP> <START> Even though there was no physical act of rebounding, which is a first for me. <STOP> <START> Gross. <STOP> <START> Seriously, Katy. <START> W5. <STOP> <START> No one has time for the silent treatment, Stewart. <STOP> <START> Not even in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> Adios. <STOP> <START> Heads up!. <STOP> <START> Nice try, shirttuckers! <STOP> <START> Ow! <STOP> <START> Hi, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Angie. <START> Wayne! <STOP> <START> Oh, my gourd, what a coincidence. <STOP> <START> Oh, I bet you're thinkin' I work here. <STOP> <START> I don't work here. <STOP> <START> I just love Guy's fries. <STOP> <START> They're so crispy, and you add a little salt. <STOP> <START> I just think they're so delicious. <STOP> <START> Ooh! <START> Who is this?

<STOP> <START> To make yourself look good by making your opponent look bad. <STOP> <START> Oh, if you got nothing good to say, you shouldn't say nothing at all. <STOP> <START> You must acknowledge the appetite for negativity in today's world. <STOP> <START> The misfortune of others, it's become sustenance. <STOP> <START> You must evolve from your primitive thinking. <STOP> <START> Do you remember the band Primitive Radio Gods?

<STOP> <START> Because it's 2015. <STOP> <START> It's not 2015. <STOP> <START> And just to really hit home this whole ethnicities thing, brown guy, have you ever seen The Simpsons? <STOP> <START> Yes. <STOP> <START> Excellent. <STOP> <START> Need you to talk like Apu, from the KwikEMart?

<STOP> <START> Ah, hell, no. <STOP> <START> I hear he's been cutting people's lawns. <STOP> <START> Like that will stop the grass from growing? <STOP> <START> Pitterpatter, let's get down to the real issues here. <STOP> <START> Being President of the Ag Hall is not an entry level job. <STOP> <START> How are ya now? <STOP> <START> Not so qualified. <STOP> <START> Can we really trust a man who can't even be bothered to wear a belt? <STOP> <START> Hell to the nahnah. <STOP> <START> He's just not ready. <STOP> <START> He's just not ready. <STOP> <START> He's just not ready. <STOP> <START> He's just not ready. <STOP> <START> He's just not ready. <STOP> <START> He's just not ready. <STOP> <START> Nice hair, though. <STOP> <START> Nice ass. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> That's what I appreciates about him. <STOP> <START> He's just not ready!. <START> Wayne for president of the Ag Hall? <STOP> <START> He's just not ready. <STOP> <START> Oh, hell no. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> There's a text from your mum. <STOP> <START> Cream for your anal fissures is in. <START> Wha. <STOP> <START> It already has 1,001 views. <STOP> <START> Slightly concerning on account of there only being 5,000 people in Letterkenny. <START> We must respond posthaste. <STOP> <START> Two wrongs don't make a right. <STOP> <START> It's jumped 10 views since we've been conversing! 1,011. <STOP> <START> This thing's going viral. <STOP> <START> There could be worse things, Stewart. <STOP> <START> I can beat Devon's view count. <STOP> <START> I give you my personal guarantee. <STOP> <START> And when I do, you won't have to sit through McMurray's pointless, purposeless, aimless, godless, motherless, meetings anymore! <STOP> <START> There's something in it for both of us. <STOP> <START> Now that's likely the least concerning thing on your hand, isn't it? <STOP> <START> All actors are present. <START> Wondrous! <START> Why are they here? <STOP> <START> Money talks. <STOP> <START> He gave us 50 bucks. <STOP> <START> It's like cutting twoandahalf lawns. <STOP> <START> But we don't even wanna be here, boys. <STOP> <START> You cheated on us, boys. <STOP> <START> Oh, pipe down, Pete and Repeat. <STOP> <START> You were both getting blowies from your big city slams the entire time. <STOP> <START> Dude, who told her about the blowies? <START> Who blew the whistle on the blowies, bro? <STOP> <START> You just did. <STOP> <START> Oh, that's gutty, bro. <STOP> <START> Shut the back door, bro. <STOP> <START> Reilly and Jonesy, Katy, are here to help us secure the youth vote. <STOP> <START> There aren't any youth voters on the Ag Hall board. <STOP> <START> There will be. <START> Why? <STOP> <START> Because it's 2015! <STOP> <START> It's not 2015. <STOP> <START> Now, gentlemen, since you are such crafty vets of the chirpslashbeak slashcarve game, I've decided to let you improvise. <START> We're really good. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <START> Wayne, let's start with you. <STOP> <START> Just, um, look directly into the camera and say something slanderous about McMurray. <STOP> <START> Kind of feels like I should make sure my own backyard's clean before throwing junk in someone else's. <STOP> <START> He slandered you first. <START> What, so you think if he goes jumps off a bridge, I'm gonna, too? <STOP> <START> Figure it out. <STOP> <START> Dan? <STOP> <START> Daryl? <STOP> <START> Please help. <STOP> <START> Reilly! <STOP> <START> Jonesy! <STOP> <START> Let's see what you can do. <STOP> <START> Okay. <START> Warm up? <STOP> <START> Yeah, warm up. <STOP> <START> Oh, sure. <STOP> <START> Absolutely. <STOP> <START> All right. . <STOP> <START> The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips. <STOP> <START> The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips. <STOP> <START> The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips. <STOP> <START> The tip of the tongue. <STOP> <START> Boys! <STOP> <START> Katy? <STOP> <START> Girls gone wild. <STOP> <START> It's not complicated! <START> We want to slander McMurray so <START> Wayne can win the election and I can beat Devon's view count. <STOP> <START> Now, let's try this. <STOP> <START> Think about your favorite actor and try to channel them. <START> Who are your favorite actors? <STOP> <START> Go! <STOP> <START> Kevin Costner. <STOP> <START> Keanu Reeves. <STOP> <START> John Candy. <STOP> <START> Chloe Sevigny. <STOP> <START> It's easy. <STOP> <START> Taylor Kitsch, boys. <STOP> <START> Big Riggins himself. <STOP> <START> You picked Big Riggins, so I'll take Michael Fassbender, bro. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> But if. <STOP> <START> If Big Riggins, if he's not available, 'cause he's my number one, it's easy, Chad Michael Murray, boys. <STOP> <START> Big Riggins is still my number one but I love Chaz Michael, bro. <STOP> <START> One Tree Hill! <STOP> <START> Boom! <STOP> <START> Go with Michael Fassbender. <STOP> <START> Try channeling that. <STOP> <START> Choose Big Riggins. <STOP> <START> You know what? <STOP> <START> Actors named Michael could really reinvent themselves if they change their names to Spike, like uh, Spike Fassbenders or, uh, Spike Caine or Spike J. <STOP> <START> Fox. <STOP> <START> Spike Buble. <STOP> <START> Chaz Spike Murray? <STOP> <START> Oh, C. <STOP> <START> Spike Murray? <STOP> <START> Let's try and stay on task! <START> Well, now it might be kind of awkward, might be kind of awkward if actors named Richards started going by Dick. <STOP> <START> Right? <STOP> <START> Like Dick Gere. <STOP> <START> Dick Pryor. <STOP> <START> Dick Dreyfuss. <STOP> <START> Lionel Dick. <STOP> <START> Feel like Richard Simmons probably prefers Dick. <STOP> <START> Dude, he got fucking mad. <START> Well, looks like she's back to cutting lawns. <STOP> <START> All those for <START> Wayne resuming presidency of the Ag Hall. <STOP> <START> Can I get a one vote here? <START> We got one over here. <STOP> <START> Now can I get a two? <STOP> <START> Twodollar bill. <STOP> <START> Two over here now can I get a three. <STOP> <START> Looking at three, three over here, now can I get a four?

<STOP> <START> Bush inspector's sleeping on shift, boys. <STOP> <START> On our junior team it's a fivedollar fine every game and praccy 'til she's shaved down to the wood, boys. <STOP> <START> Hey, get that hedge hog off your tummy stick, bud. <STOP> <START> You're fucking gross, bud. <STOP> <START> You're fucking gross, bud. <STOP> <START> Looks like we got a couple of cocklookers, Yorkie. <STOP> <START> Of course, the Schmelts like a good cocklook, Barts. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah, I fucking cocklooked 'cause your junk's a fucking car crash and you can't look away. <STOP> <START> I cocklooked 'cause your junk's a fucking strobe light. <STOP> <START> I can see it with my eyes closed! <STOP> <START> So you were cocklooking. <STOP> <START> They just admitted they cocklooked. <START> Well, I cocklooked 'cause your junk's a fucking welding flame, buddy. <STOP> <START> You look directly at it and your fucking retinas getting burned. <STOP> <START> I cocklooked because your junk's a fucking child walking in on his parents. <STOP> <START> Once you see it, it cannot be unseen. <STOP> <START> All this time cocklooking could be better spent doing legs. <STOP> <START> More legs, less cocklooking, Schmelts. <STOP> <START> I fucking skipped leg day, boys. <STOP> <START> Fuck leg day, boys! <STOP> <START> You are woefully uninformed, aren't you? <STOP> <START> How? <STOP> <START> I said I would beat Devon's view count, not win you the election. <STOP> <START> And guess what? <STOP> <START> I did beat Devon's view count. <STOP> <START> Look. <STOP> <START> Oh, I don't give a care. <STOP> <START> I've been contacted by Budweiser and Carl's Jr. over copyright infringements, but I don't think they're serious. <STOP> <START> You wanna know what? <STOP> <START> McMurray's meetings are a bit painful, but not sure that's good enough reason to get into politics. <STOP> <START> They're all crooks. <STOP> <START> Every one of them. <STOP> <START> Now run along, Stewart, before I get bored of behaving. <START> Well, I guess she's off to chore. <STOP> <START> Been busy cutting other people's fucking lawns all week. <STOP> <START> Jim Dickins. <STOP> <START> How're ya now? <STOP> <START> It's Dicks. <STOP> <START> Nope, you got it right that time. <STOP> <START> Good n' you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> I said I'd return the favor for cutting the lawn. <STOP> <START> I figured there's no time like the present. <STOP> <START> Can we give you a hand with anything?You're having thirsty Thursday with your pals the other day. <STOP> <START> It was my cousin's sixth birthday party yesterday. <START> Which cousin? <STOP> <START> Samuel. <STOP> <START> I fuckin' hate Samuel. <START> Well, Samuel likes you. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' hate Samuel so much. <START> Well, Samuel's not so bad. <STOP> <START> I seen Samuel in the laundry room with the cat one time. <STOP> <START> You just know that little fucker's gonna put him in the dryer. <STOP> <START> That's a hasty conclusion. <STOP> <START> Not if you seen Samuel trying to put himself in there 15 minutes earlier. <STOP> <START> I seen Samuel snort a line of Fun Dip on his fifth birthday. <START> Well, it's reason fuckin' five million I didn't go to his sixth birthday party. <STOP> <START> He was doing a Fun Dip dry rip. <STOP> <START> A what? <STOP> <START> Or rippsin' a Fun Dip dry one. <START> Well, what's that? <START> Well, in schneef terms, if you do a line of schneef before you've ingested any booze to alter your judgment, it's called doing a dry rip. <STOP> <START> Or rippsin' a dry one. <STOP> <START> Doin' dry rips is a pretty good indication you got a schneef problem. <STOP> <START> You got yourselves a schneef issue. <START> Well, yous ever done a dry rip? <START> Well, back in the day. <STOP> <START> In the glory days. <STOP> <START> Yeah, I done a dry rip. <STOP> <START> I'd a rips a dry one. <STOP> <START> Not sure if rippin' a Fun dip dry rip would have the same effect, but doin' it is still a pretty good indication you got some sort of problem. <START> Well, hoopin' Fun Dip definitely wouldn't have the same effects, but it's definitely an indication you got yourselves a problem. <START> Well, what's hoopin'? <START> Well, that's instead of taking the drugs orally's or intranasally's, you take 'em anally's. <START> What the fuck you talking about now? <START> Well, instead of down the hatch or up the nose, you take 'em in the pooper. <START> Wait, you put drugs up your pooper? <STOP> <START> That's the fastest way to absorbs 'em into your systems. <STOP> <START> Do you mean like you take the drugs with your hand. <START> Well, then you put 'em up your pooper? <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> But you don't poop 'em out? <STOP> <START> No, your pooper absorbs 'em. <START> Well, isn't that curious. <STOP> <START> Hoopin' Fun Dip definitely wouldn't have the same effect as hoopin' schneef. <STOP> <START> But doing it is still probably a pretty good indication you got some sort of a problem. <STOP> <START> I guess a Fun Dip dick dinger wouldn't be the ends of the world. <STOP> <START> You wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I heard my friends J. <STOP> <START> P. and J. <START> W. talk about Fun Dip dick dingers one time. <START> Well, whose dick was gettin' dinged? <START> Well, I thought it was a bit intrusive to ask whose dick was gettin' dinged. <STOP> <START> As long as they're both consentin' adults, it really doesn't matter whose dick's gettin' dinged. <START> Well, I really hope the Fun Dip candy stick isn't going to waste in all this. <STOP> <START> Do you wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I pulled my first allnighter with my friend Chad in grade eight playing Pokemans and eating Fun Dip. <STOP> <START> Oh, waits. <STOP> <START> If. <STOP> <START> If Samuel's already been takin' Fun Dips orally's and intranasally's. <STOP> <START> Yeah, we should probably go check on Samuel. <STOP> <START> I fuckin' hate Samuel so much. <STOP> <START> You got any dates lined up this week, good buddy? <STOP> <START> Nah, I'm gonna put that bullshit on the back burner for a bit, bud. <STOP> <START> Soft, literally. <STOP> <START> Parks 'er behind the barn for a bits? <STOP> <START> Tenply. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Gotta find Stormy a stud. <STOP> <START> That's a priority. <STOP> <START> She's a beautiful dog. <STOP> <START> Oh, she's a real beauty. <STOP> <START> No, she's a gorgeous dog. <STOP> <START> She just tries to kill her studs, is the thing. <START> Well, that's my girl. <STOP> <START> Maybe you should takes her in for a fingers in the bum. <STOP> <START> Are you fuckin' preoccupied? <STOP> <START> That's only the answer sometimes. <STOP> <START> Squirrelly Dan working' Squirrelly OT. <STOP> <START> Not all the time. <STOP> <START> Just to checks. <STOP> <START> Sometimes. <STOP> <START> Are you fuckin' preoccupied? <STOP> <START> Doesn't matter what you takes her in for. <STOP> <START> As sure as a bush is gonna break your fall, Stormy's gonna get some fingers in the bum. <STOP> <START> How deep? <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake. <START> What do ya means, how deep? <STOP> <START> How many knuckles? <STOP> <START> Like how many knuckles deep? <STOP> <START> Yeah, are we talking about a oneknuckler or a twoknuckler? <STOP> <START> Oh, be at least a threeknuckler to gets to the bottom of this. <STOP> <START> Oh, see, now, that's too many. <STOP> <START> Is not. <START> Well, a person's got two knuckles so you're saying that the vet would have to fire a threeknuckler up Stormy's bum to get to the bottom of it? <STOP> <START> A person has three knuckles. <START> Well, a person has two knuckles. <STOP> <START> Figure it out. <STOP> <START> A person has three knuckles. <STOP> <START> You figure it out. <STOP> <START> A person's got two knuckles, okay? <STOP> <START> One, two. <STOP> <START> Three. <STOP> <START> You forgots about the little knuckles underneath the fingernails. <START> Well, see now, that's not a knuckle, though, Dan. <STOP> <START> To be a knuckle, you gotta be able to punch somebody with it. <STOP> <START> You can't punch somebody with the knuckle underneath the fingernail, can you? <STOP> <START> Can too. <START> Well, you'll be looking pretty fuckin' silly. <STOP> <START> First knuckle, one knuckler. <STOP> <START> Second knuckle, twoknuckler. <STOP> <START> Third knuckle, threeknuckler. <STOP> <START> So then by your logic the vet would have to fire a full finger up Stormy's bum to get to the bottom of it. <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> See, I'm just not so goddamn sure I can stand by and watch the vet give Stormy a threeknuckler up the bum. <STOP> <START> No, I don't think Stormy would need a threeknuckler up the bum. <START> Well, thank you, Dary, because then you'd think the vet's a bit funny, would you not? <STOP> <START> Mmm, a person has three knuckles, though. <STOP> <START> Thank you, Dary. <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake, go ahead and have a fuckin' fight with your first knuckle then. <STOP> <START> You'll be lookin' pretty fuckin' silly. <STOP> <START> Yeah, but when we're talkin' about a twoknuckler, we're talking about horizontal knuckles. <STOP> <START> I'm gonna stop you there. <STOP> <START> By your logic, a sixknuckler can be dealt with using these two fingers? <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> Incorrect. <STOP> <START> No such thing as a sixknuckler. <STOP> <START> A sixknuckler existed, I'd know about it. <STOP> <START> How are ya now, Gail? <STOP> <START> Good, and you?

<START> What's the problem, Dan? <STOP> <START> That's alcohol's abuse. <START> Well, to be fair. <STOP> <START> Oh, don't say to be fair. <STOP> <START> I hate when people say to be fair. <STOP> <START> It sounds like, To be faiuh. <STOP> <START> To be faiuh. <START> Well, to be faiuh. <STOP> <START> The bottom inch of a beer bottle is 50% spit. <START> Well, don't be gross. <STOP> <START> Bugs could have crawled down there and died, too. <STOP> <START> You don't know. <START> What'd I just say? <START> Well, it's the same reason you don't eat the bottom of an ice cream cone. <STOP> <START> Not sure how I feels about this talk. <START> What, do you think they check for bugs down there in the cone factory? <STOP> <START> Fuck, no. <STOP> <START> They just throw the cones in the box. <STOP> <START> Figure it out. <STOP> <START> Can we move past this, please? <START> What, do ya think they check for bugs down there at the cone shop? <STOP> <START> Fuck, no. <STOP> <START> They just throw the ice cream on there. <STOP> <START> Have a good one. <STOP> <START> This conversation's fast becoming a confrontation. <STOP> <START> Like, here, have some ice cream and fucking bugs, likely. <START> What do you do with the bottoms of the ice cream cones? <START> Well, you throw it on the fucking ground, Dan. <STOP> <START> You let the bugs eat it. <STOP> <START> It's the circle of life. <STOP> <START> Didn't you never see The Lion King? <STOP> <START> You know I love The Lion King. <START> We're out of beer. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Beer store's closed. <STOP> <START> Fuck, do I miss MoDean's. <STOP> <START> Reason fucking five million we need some sort of bar in this town. <STOP> <START> Green, blue, and gold? <STOP> <START> I don't like where this is headed. <STOP> <START> Yeah, it's the leftovers from the Christmas potluck. <START> We haven't had that in years. <STOP> <START> A half dozen at least. <START> Well, a half baker's, but that's splitting hairs. <STOP> <START> Creme de menthe, Blue Curacao, Butter Ripple Schnapps. <STOP> <START> Now, what the fuck am I supposed to do with creme de menthe? <STOP> <START> Splash of milk, with three scoops of chocolate ice cream, you got yourself a Frozen Girl Scout. <STOP> <START> Do I look like the type of prick to have a Frozen Girl Scout, Dary? <START> What am I supposed to do with Blue Curacao? <STOP> <START> Mix apple juice, pear juice, garnish with blackberries, you got yourself a Blue Bijou. <STOP> <START> I think I'd rather have a Blue Bijou. <STOP> <START> There's not enough for two. <STOP> <START> Says you. <START> Well, what am I supposed to do with Butter Ripple Schnapps? <START> Well, that's easy, KatyKat. <STOP> <START> Down the hatch. <STOP> <START> I'd be tasting that for days. <START> What's the meaning of this? <STOP> <START> I found it in an old golf bag. <STOP> <START> And why do you get it? <STOP> <START> It's warm. <STOP> <START> It's still a beer. <START> Well, to be fair. <STOP> <START> To be faiuh. <STOP> <START> To be faiuh. <STOP> <START> To be faiuh. <STOP> <START> To be faiuh. <STOP> <START> He is essentially drinking a bottle of piss right now. <STOP> <START> Now, you're no mixologist but your best bet here is to mix 'em all together into what you call donkey juice. <STOP> <START> However, to be faiuh, donkey juice will make you spit. <START> Well, can't win 'em all. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie died. <STOP> <START> Did he? <STOP> <START> Dumdiddydo. <START> Well, you can't win 'em all. <STOP> <START> Mr. <STOP> <START> Letterkenny himself. <STOP> <START> Longeststanding mayor in the history of Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> And you know that snowbird enjoyed the homestretch in Fort Lauderdale. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah, just hanging out down there playing crokinole and shuffleboard with his good pals. <STOP> <START> He was a good guy. <STOP> <START> He was a real good guy. <STOP> <START> He left us a bunch of money. <STOP> <START> Did he? <STOP> <START> Dumdiddydo. <STOP> <START> How much? <STOP> <START> Five K. <START> What a great fucking guy. <STOP> <START> He was a real great fucking guy. <START> Well, he'd want us to have a party. <STOP> <START> He wants us to put it back into the community. <START> What a great fucking guy! <STOP> <START> He says in his will that he's fallen out of touch with the community and he trusts our judgment to give five K some legs around here. <START> Well, sure as God's got sandals. <STOP> <START> So, how do you want to fuck this pig? <START> Well, you'd better put it on your fucking Facebook. <STOP> <START> PitterPatter. <STOP> <START> Let's get at 'er. <STOP> <START> Faster than shit through a goose. <STOP> <START> Licketysplit. <STOP> <START> You've entered the barn, where ideas come to blossom or be ridiculed relentlessly. <STOP> <START> On one side, two nononsense farmers are looking to give away their uncle's money. <STOP> <START> On the other, savvy entrepreneurs hoping to acquire it. <STOP> <START> First up, three degens from Letterkenny are hoping to sell the farmers on their solution for a common smalltown problem. <STOP> <START> Hi, Bonnie. <STOP> <START> Hi, Katy. <STOP> <START> Hi, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> How are ya now? <STOP> <START> Good and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> Say, thanks for the, uh. <START> Well, the thing you did there. <STOP> <START> No problem, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Any time. <STOP> <START> Good afternoon, hicks. <START> We are asking for. <STOP> <START> Is it true that you have a massive horn? <STOP> <START> Yes. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No?. <STOP> <START> I mean, there's no way that they could possibly know that. <STOP> <START> I saw Stewart's penis at the Elmira pool on my 11th birthday. <STOP> <START> Looked like a 12ounce cut of pork tenderloin hanging there. <STOP> <START> Erroneous. <STOP> <START> I saw Stewart's penis when we touched tubes, as normal, inquisitive, young boys do, and it looked six pool balls were stuck inside a gym sock, hanging there. <STOP> <START> Unverified. <STOP> <START> Told ya. <STOP> <START> Fuck! <START> We are asking for five K for 66.6% of our company. <STOP> <START> Outstanding. <START> We want to give back to the community by helping people get sober. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie got sober as a birthday present to himself on his 90th. <START> Which was curious, 'cause he'd come that far, right? <STOP> <START> I should say. <STOP> <START> And we plan on doing this by getting the biggest disasters in Letterkenny, and putting them in a room with cameras. <STOP> <START> From there, we film their friends and family telling them they must halt said disastery, posthaste! <STOP> <START> Is disastery a word? <STOP> <START> It's a band name. <STOP> <START> Quantifiable. <START> Want to know what? <STOP> <START> It feels like I might have seen something like this on a TV show one time. <START> We've arranged a demo of how this might work. <START> We have? <STOP> <START> Stewart, you are such a disastery that sometimes you don't even know if it's a weekday or the weekend. <STOP> <START> It hurts me to see you being such a disaster. <STOP> <START> I wish you could go back to being only a mild disaster. <STOP> <START> Love, Devon. <STOP> <START> This antic was not discussed or rehearsed. <STOP> <START> Stewart, I worry that your disastery is the result of when we touched tubes as young boys. <STOP> <START> I think about touching tubes with you and sometimes wish I could go back in time and not touch tubes. <STOP> <START> Perhaps had we not touched tubes, you wouldn't be such a disaster. <STOP> <START> Love, Roald. <STOP> <START> Drollery was to be left on the cuttingroom floor. <STOP> <START> Anywho. <STOP> <START> Your idea comes from a good place, but Uncle Eddie always believed that if a man needs help, he'll ask. <STOP> <START> He won't be told. <STOP> <START> And for that reason, I'm out. <STOP> <START> Sounds like touching tubes was a pretty big setback for Stewart, but your pitch was the real disaster. <STOP> <START> I'm out. <STOP> <START> So, do we win? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, these winners of the genetic lottery with no more than an ounce of gray matter between them, hope the farmers get behind their plan for young people in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> So, are you just going to do that every time, then, Bonnie? <START> Well, if you want me to, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Yes, please. <STOP> <START> You got it, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Thank you. <STOP> <START> Good afternoon, <START> Wayne, and shewedonotspeakof. <STOP> <START> Oh, piss off. <STOP> <START> You both took down your team's student trainer on her kinesiology coop. <STOP> <START> How'd she find out about. <STOP> <START> Shh! <STOP> <START> There's hope for you yet, boys. <START> We are here asking for five K for 49% of our company. <STOP> <START> Super. <START> We want to give back to the community by investing in the youth, boys. <STOP> <START> Really hustle for the youth, boys. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie loved kids. <STOP> <START> His only shortcoming, really. <START> We want to take the toughest youth in Letterkenny and put them into a house together, with a gym and with a pool. <STOP> <START> There, they'll work out together while receiving instructions from coaches, Joint Boy and Tyson. <STOP> <START> They will then fight each other one by one to find out who is, in fact, the toughest kid in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> This concept sounds a bit familiar. <STOP> <START> No, it's a fresh concept, ferda. <STOP> <START> Ferda fresh. <START> Well, I'm trying to wrap my head around this, so I've got a few questions, here. <STOP> <START> So, you want to put a bunch of dudes in a house together? <STOP> <START> Yes. <STOP> <START> They'll be wearing only gym shorts, as you can see in the poster. <STOP> <START> And then you'll have all these dudes work out together? <STOP> <START> Yes, and they'll always be shirtless 'cause there's no AC. <STOP> <START> It's hot. <STOP> <START> Then when all these dudes are done working out together, they can go swimming together? <STOP> <START> Oh, we'll teach them how to wrestle, too. <STOP> <START> Hold downs, full mount, top control. <STOP> <START> Throw some booze in the house. <STOP> <START> They can have a drink together. <START> What are you really trying to accomplish here, boys?. <STOP> <START> Great presentation. <STOP> <START> I really love the bulletin board with all the sweaty dudes. <STOP> <START> You can just leave that here. <STOP> <START> But I don't think that Uncle Eddie would say, Katy, great investment in sweaty dudes. <STOP> <START> And for that reason, I'm out. <STOP> <START> You want to know what? <STOP> <START> I'm just going to come right out and say it, and you can take that bulletin board with you, please and thanks. <STOP> <START> This idea's a tad fruityloops. <STOP> <START> And for that reason, oh, I'm out. <START> What?. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, this bartender turned dogbreeder hopes Cupid will find his way to Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> Say, Bonnie, could I get you anything? <STOP> <START> A glass of water, or. <STOP> <START> I'm okay, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Thanks, though. <START> Well, if you change your mind, you can just run to the house there, help yourself. <STOP> <START> Maybe I will run over then. <STOP> <START> Can I get you anything? <START> Well, no, I'm okay. <STOP> <START> Do you want anything from the. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <START> Wet your whistle. <STOP> <START> No, I'm good. <STOP> <START> I got some water. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> No, we're okay. <STOP> <START> Thank you, Bonnie. <STOP> <START> Cool, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Good afternoon, <START> Wayne, Katy. <STOP> <START> Gail, how are you now? <STOP> <START> Good, and you? <START> Well, not so bad. <STOP> <START> I'm asking for five K for 69% of my company. <START> Why 69? <STOP> <START> Both sides benefit. <STOP> <START> Good enough. <STOP> <START> I want to give back to the community by helping people find love. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie was a notorious matchmaker. <STOP> <START> And a real fucking legend on the D floor right up till the bitter end. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And I plan on doing that by putting 20 women from Letterkenny into a house with you, and having 'em all compete for your hand in marriage. <START> Who, me? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <START> Well, get after it. <STOP> <START> Isn't this already a reality series? <STOP> <START> If it is, no one watches it. <START> Well, I'd fucking watch it, boy howdy. <STOP> <START> I'll have the girls perform campy tasks and complete silly challenges to prove their mettle. <START> Well, that sounds fun. <STOP> <START> Unnecessary, but go on. <STOP> <START> Then you'd go on group dates with them and oneonone dates with them. <STOP> <START> And then you ax them one by one until you decide which one you want to marry. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> I'm not sure it's reasonable that he could choose a wife based just on that. <STOP> <START> I know. <STOP> <START> Tastes good, but where's the cream filling? <STOP> <START> Like a Boston cream? <STOP> <START> Canadian maple's better. <START> Well, that's a Texassized 104. <STOP> <START> Here's the kicker. <START> When it gets down to the final three girls, deal is, you get to go to their houses and meet their families. <STOP> <START> See? <STOP> <START> Now that's reasonable. <STOP> <START> And then you get to spend a night with each of them, until you decide which one you want to marry. <STOP> <START> Is that. <STOP> <START> Does she. <START> With all three? <STOP> <START> Does she mean. <STOP> <START> After the. <START> Well, maybe it means that I would have to. <STOP> <START> I don't want to talk about it, just ask her. <STOP> <START> Okay, I'll ask her. <STOP> <START> You want to know what? <STOP> <START> I got some fucking questions here. <STOP> <START> Shaboink! <STOP> <START> Now, when you say I spend the night with three of them, is it implied I have sex with all three of them? <STOP> <START> Sure is. <STOP> <START> So, I meet their families. <STOP> <START> Then we go have sex. <STOP> <START> I do that with three of them, before deciding which one I want to marry? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do the girls know going into the process that I will be having sex with them and two other girls before deciding which one I want to marry? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Maybe more. <STOP> <START> And do the girls' families, who I've just met, also know, going into the process, that I will be having sex with their daughters, as well as two other girls who are not their daughters, before deciding which one I want to marry? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And the girls, and their families, find this process entirely rational, despite how selfharming, healthhazardous, and humiliating it very likely will be? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do you say 20 girls, and their families will happily sign up for this process? <STOP> <START> Over and over, I imagine. <STOP> <START> Oh, Gail, I don't want to date a girl like that, for fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> Comes from a family like that. <STOP> <START> Fuck. <STOP> <START> Gail, could there be a female version where there's one girl and 20 dudes? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> I'm in. <STOP> <START> No! <STOP> <START> Ew! <STOP> <START> You're out. <STOP> <START> And do you want to know what? <START> What? <STOP> <START> I'm out. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, this husband and wife pair from RR2 Letterkenny wants to go hunting for buried treasure. <STOP> <START> Bonnie! <STOP> <START> Bonnie! <STOP> <START> Did ya feed the dog? <STOP> <START> Yes! <STOP> <START> Oh, well, thank you. <STOP> <START> Jim Dickins, how are you now? <STOP> <START> Good, and you? <STOP> <START> Oh, not so bad. <STOP> <START> McMurray, how are. <START> Wayne, how are. <START> Well, good. <START> Well, I'm good and. <STOP> <START> I'm not so. <STOP> <START> Oh, not so. <STOP> <START> Uh. <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> Go ahead. <STOP> <START> You, you were first so. <STOP> <START> No, why don't you go ahead? <STOP> <START> Oh, I didn't want to be impolite. <STOP> <START> Just start talking, please, McMurray. <STOP> <START> So you can go ahead and start. <STOP> <START> If you're going to go first, then it would be your turn. <STOP> <START> Just pretend what I had to say wasn't important. <STOP> <START> You're here to pitch, are you not? <STOP> <START> Are you sure you don't want to say anything? <STOP> <START> Jesus, PitterPatter, McMurray! <STOP> <START> Good enough. <STOP> <START> Have at 'er. <STOP> <START> Yip, yip, yip. <STOP> <START> Now, we are asking for five K for 5% of our business. <STOP> <START> Okay. <START> We want to give back to the community by helping them cocksuckers get rich. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie used to buy lottery tickets for the seniors at the home every week. <STOP> <START> MRS. <STOP> <START> And we want to goddamn do that by auctioning off other people's shit. <STOP> <START> Bingo. <STOP> <START> Did you know that there are storage facilities surrounding Letterkenny that are filled with other people's useless piles of their shit, that they have forgotten about? <STOP> <START> Abandoned it, baby. <STOP> <START> They abandoned their shit. <STOP> <START> Abandoned their shit. <STOP> <START> Now, whose knob do I got to polish to get a cocksucking gin and tonic around here? <STOP> <START> All right. <START> We have secured the auctioneering right for these such storage facilities with the help of our friend, Jimmy Dickskin. <STOP> <START> Dickins. <STOP> <START> That's exactly what I said. <STOP> <START> So, what we want to do is we want to take people down there and have them rummage through all the shit and then buy some of the stuff and probably, more than likely, most definitely, find hidden treasures, gold and jewels. <STOP> <START> And I'd settle for a Tom Collins, if it'll get this rig rolling. <STOP> <START> So, you want to sell other people's shit that they left in their storage locker. <STOP> <START> Abandoned. <STOP> <START> Abandoned. <STOP> <START> Things that they abandoned. <STOP> <START> But it's a storage locker and nobody's got any good shit in there. <STOP> <START> You would be surprised. <STOP> <START> I'm never surprised. <START> Well, you will be once we show you a demonstration of one such storage locker that we have brought down from the tiny town of Tiverton. <STOP> <START> Baby, if you will. <STOP> <START> Shall I call you Vanna, for a little roleplay? <STOP> <START> Uhhuh, baby, you know what I mean? <STOP> <START> All right, and a one, and a two, and a three, Jimmy Dickskin! <STOP> <START> Got a beautiful set of DVDs. <STOP> <START> To start the bidding. <STOP> <START> DVDs galore, look at that. <STOP> <START> One, two, three, four, five. <STOP> <START> That's $50 guaranteed for sure for DVDs alone. <STOP> <START> Then we got a VCR. <STOP> <START> That's a vintage VCR. <STOP> <START> Guaranteed $50 for that sweet piece of machinery right then and there. <STOP> <START> Maybe 100, maybe 150. <STOP> <START> No big problem. <START> What else have we got, baby? <STOP> <START> Fishing lures. <START> What man doesn't want 'em? <START> What man doesn't need 'em? <START> What man doesn't throw fishing lures all over the goddamn place? <STOP> <START> Hundreds by the thousands. <STOP> <START> Five dollars a fishing lure guaranteeing it for fucking sure. <STOP> <START> So, you got five, probably times 100, probably $5,000 right there, sitting alone in that box. <STOP> <START> That microwave was probably touched by Mahatma Gandhi. <STOP> <START> Easy! <STOP> <START> Maybe even Jesus. <STOP> <START> The proper thing, I guarantee ya, is worth $100,000, no problem. <STOP> <START> A bit generous on your evaluations there, bud. <STOP> <START> All right, 100,000 might be too much, but maybe 50,000. <START> What have we got now, baby? <STOP> <START> Looks like we got a handyman storage locker, baby. <STOP> <START> Handyman storage. <START> We got corn silk white. <START> We got lavender brush white paint. <START> We got. <STOP> <START> Mint. <STOP> <START> Mint cream white paint! <STOP> <START> You can cream all over the place! <STOP> <START> All over your ceilings! <STOP> <START> You can do them! <STOP> <START> Come in here and buy all of that paint and paint your apartment and give you $100 cash in your hands. <STOP> <START> Ya hear me? <START> What else we got, baby? <STOP> <START> And now we're talking big money. <START> We got the bits. <START> We got bits. <STOP> <START> Bits coming out of the ass. <STOP> <START> Twist bits, drill bits, fucking Brad bits. <STOP> <START> All over the place. <STOP> <START> Baby's putting them in. <STOP> <START> Gonna have so many bits, you can put 'em in your tits. <STOP> <START> You can put in your mouth, you can shake 'em all around, do a little dance, and all kinds of shit. <STOP> <START> Bits all over the place. <STOP> <START> You can have so many, you can lick 'em, suck 'em, kick 'em fucking right in. <STOP> <START> Not for me, though, but somebody else who's into that kind of shit. <STOP> <START> Each one is guaranteed to be at least $100. <STOP> <START> No problem there, for sure. $100 each bit! <STOP> <START> No, they're not. <STOP> <START> Sure God damn are! <STOP> <START> No, they're not. <STOP> <START> Jimmy Dickskin! <STOP> <START> Dickins! <STOP> <START> I know it's Dickins, and I meant no offense. <STOP> <START> I was just trying to get you to stop the. <START> Well, the thing you're doing. <STOP> <START> No one keeps shit in their storage locker that you can rich off of. <STOP> <START> Only shit like Brad point bits, really. <STOP> <START> Yep, see. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie would have wanted me to take this idea and put it in a storage locker, then abandon it. <STOP> <START> I'm out! <STOP> <START> You want to know what? <START> Whoever called it the Brad point bit would have done themselves a favor by calling it the Brad Pitt bit. <STOP> <START> But either way I'm out. <STOP> <START> That's marketing genius right there, <START> Wayne, but you snooze, you lose, buggers. <STOP> <START> You're looking at three millionaires walking away from ya in the dust. <STOP> <START> Have a good day! <STOP> <START> On the morrow!. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, this southern evangelist turned Letterkenny youth worker brings the sound of music. <STOP> <START> Bonnie, where'd you get your dress? <STOP> <START> I don't know. <STOP> <START> It was a Christmas present. <STOP> <START> Can you find out? <STOP> <START> I think so. <STOP> <START> It's so cute. <STOP> <START> Thank you. <STOP> <START> You're welcome. <STOP> <START> Do you like it, <START> Wayne? <STOP> <START> Glen, how're you now? <STOP> <START> Oh, good and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <START> Well, I want your five K. <STOP> <START> For what percent? <STOP> <START> Uh, at 0%. <STOP> <START> That's the Lord's percentage. <STOP> <START> Oh, is that what it is? <STOP> <START> Yes. <STOP> <START> Now, what I would like to do, is to give back to the community by spreading the word of Christ. <STOP> <START> Okay .through song! <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie was an atheist. <START> Well. <STOP> <START> Then he couldn't have been a Boy Scout because atheism violates our pledge. <STOP> <START> You're a Boy Scout? <STOP> <START> Uh, yeah. <STOP> <START> Fastest Boy Scout to ever earn his badges in basketing and buglery. <STOP> <START> Hey, ya ever had a Frozen Girl Scout? <STOP> <START> Yes! <STOP> <START> But with three scoops of chocolate gelato instead of ice cream. <STOP> <START> I'm proudly lactose intolerant. <STOP> <START> So am I, but you can power through that if you really want to. <START> Wayne! <STOP> <START> I'd like to introduce you to Milo, Levi, and Finn. <STOP> <START> Those sound like stage names. <STOP> <START> Oh, they are. <STOP> <START> Their actual names are Kennedy, Cullen, Campbell. <STOP> <START> Those sound like last names. <STOP> <START> They are. <STOP> <START> Now I would like to take these boys to Los Angeles to audition for a little show you might have heard of, called America's Got Talent. <STOP> <START> Now, I know what you're thinking. <START> Why can't you just bring 'em to the local model search and talent show that's coming to town soon? <START> Well, I would prefer to bring them directly to the epicenter of everything. <STOP> <START> Make 'em superfamous and then inspire loads of other boys, all over Letterkenny, to sing. <START> What do ya sing?

<STOP> <START> You should feel bad about even suggesting that the Ginger and Boots fucked an ostrich. <STOP> <START> Bad gas travels real fast in a small town. <STOP> <START> My research concludes that the only way the Ginger and Boots could have fucked an ostrich is if it was a dead ostrich. <STOP> <START> Ginger and Boots. a dead ostrich? <STOP> <START> I thought it was just sick! <STOP> <START> Oh, my! <STOP> <START> Ginny? <STOP> <START> The Ginger and Boots effed a dead ostrich. <STOP> <START> Oh, bother. <STOP> <START> Of course I know what the male ones are called! <STOP> <START> Check my browser history. <STOP> <START> Don't show her weakness, Stewart. <STOP> <START> I'm not. <STOP> <START> I'm sun burnt. <STOP> <START> Hey, you! <STOP> <START> Hey, you. <STOP> <START> This is awkward but your shirt seems to have shrunk in the wash. <STOP> <START> Not awkward. <STOP> <START> Things shrink in the wash. <STOP> <START> How do you explain your dick?

<STOP> <START> Negative. <STOP> <START> It's when you have a friend call 10, 15 minutes into a date to be sure the date isn't a total bust. <STOP> <START> And if it is, then you can play the phone call as though it's an emergency and leave the date. <START> Well, that's fair. <STOP> <START> I guess we are first cousin to an emergency here. <STOP> <START> A good one. <STOP> <START> And you shouldn't be afraid of it. <STOP> <START> I think we could do good things here. <STOP> <START> I'm going to call my friend and cancel her pending emergency call, and when I get back, let's talk about your feelings, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Let's really talk about them. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> I wanna take 'em, and I wanna talk about them. <STOP> <START> Oh, it's <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> How are you now?

<STOP> <START> She acts like. <STOP> <START> You should try an open relationship. <STOP> <START> Could be productive. <STOP> <START> You could also try a hall pass. <STOP> <START> It's when you give, you know, her being allowed to sleep with one person and that's it, no questions asked. <STOP> <START> Another plausibly fruitful option. <STOP> <START> New GTA and COD out today. <START> We're going to sesh. <STOP> <START> Been gaming much?

<STOP> <START> Can confirm. <STOP> <START> You don't smell like one. <STOP> <START> I'm kidding. <STOP> <START> I'm a preschool principal. <STOP> <START> Do you like kids? <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> I know, everyone likes kids. <STOP> <START> They're so silly. <STOP> <START> I love them when they're silly. <STOP> <START> But if they get too silly, they have to come see me. <STOP> <START> Silly? <STOP> <START> Mischief. <STOP> <START> Trouble. <START> We use gentler terms. <STOP> <START> As a policy. <START> Well, so what happens when they come see you? <START> Well, we do things a little differently in our program. <STOP> <START> The approach is progressive and positive. <START> We issue a hug consent form to parents, which allows us to hug their kids. <STOP> <START> Because 99% of the time, all kids need is a hug. <STOP> <START> A hug? <STOP> <START> A squeeze. <START> Well, you squeeze 'em. <STOP> <START> An embrace. <STOP> <START> Oh. <STOP> <START> Oh? <START> Well. <START> What is it? <STOP> <START> Nothin'. <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Yeah? <STOP> <START> Speak freely. <STOP> <START> No, I'd better not. <STOP> <START> That's the only way we'll get to know each other. <STOP> <START> But do you ever smack 'em? <STOP> <START> Excuse me? <STOP> <START> Like, give 'em a good whack? <STOP> <START> I don't follow. <STOP> <START> Do you ever hit the kid? <STOP> <START> Like, for being too silly. <STOP> <START> No! <START> Wayne. <START> We never hit our kids. <STOP> <START> You shouldn't hit kids. <START> Well, you know what, don't you remember how scared you were of your principal when you were growing up? <STOP> <START> It's 'cause he'd smack you if you were being too silly. <STOP> <START> Like your parents wanted you to have a principal who would smack you. <STOP> <START> They took comfort in the fact that they were sending you to a place every day where someone would smack you for them if you were being too silly. <STOP> <START> And sometimes I see kids these days, I kind of think, like. <STOP> <START> Like, wish you could still do that. <STOP> <START> That sort of discipline is long outdated, <START> Wayne, and frowned upon. <START> We sit the child down. <STOP> <START> That's another problem. <START> What is? <STOP> <START> In my opinion. <STOP> <START> Sitting? <START> Well, no wonder kids are failin' school, just sittin' around all day. <STOP> <START> Stand up, you're not doing nothin'. <STOP> <START> You think sitting is a problem? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <START> Why? 'Cause it makes you soft. <STOP> <START> Literally or figuratively? <START> Well, both, I suppose. <STOP> <START> Both? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> In my opinion. <STOP> <START> My phone's buzzing. <START> Well, so you like cookies and cream ice cream, hey? <START> Well, I think it's pretty good, too. <STOP> <START> Hi, Michelle. <STOP> <START> Oh, no. <STOP> <START> Okay, I'll be right there. <STOP> <START> I'm sorry, <START> Wayne, I've gotta go. <STOP> <START> It's. <STOP> <START> An emergency. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> It's <START> Wayne. <START> Well, how are you now? <STOP> <START> Oh, not so bad. <STOP> <START> Yeah, this one's too soft. <START> What? <STOP> <START> I'm not talking to you. <STOP> <START> Super. <STOP> <START> It's been three days. <START> Why haven't you asked me what's wrong? <STOP> <START> Something wrong? <STOP> <START> Of course it is. <STOP> <START> You act like I don't. <STOP> <START> Should I have known that? <STOP> <START> It's called the silent treatment. <STOP> <START> Step one, I stop talking to you. <STOP> <START> Step two, you form the conclusion that something is wrong. <STOP> <START> Step three, you ask me what's wrong. <START> What's up with step one? <STOP> <START> You've skipped step one and two. <START> What's step three again? <STOP> <START> You ask me what's wrong! <STOP> <START> Got it. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> You bet. <STOP> <START> Go ahead. <START> Where? <STOP> <START> Step three. <START> What's step three again? <START> We'll skip step three. <STOP> <START> I'm just going to tell you what's wrong. <STOP> <START> That should have been step one. <START> Wrong. <STOP> <START> Step one and two are fundamental steps. <STOP> <START> You missed steps, Stewart. <STOP> <START> How? <STOP> <START> Step one, become angry with someone. <STOP> <START> Step two, tell that someone that you're angry. <STOP> <START> Step three, resolve anger with that someone. <STOP> <START> Step four. <STOP> <START> Step four. <STOP> <START> Step four, resume peaceful existence. <STOP> <START> Your logic is frighteningly bewitching. <STOP> <START> Phantasmagoric. <STOP> <START> It's time for you to go. <START> What? <START> Where? <STOP> <START> Leave here? <STOP> <START> It was a rebound. <STOP> <START> Even though there was no physical act of rebounding, which is a first for me. <STOP> <START> Gross. <STOP> <START> Seriously, Katy. <START> W5. <STOP> <START> No one has time for the silent treatment, Stewart. <STOP> <START> Not even in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> Adios. <STOP> <START> Heads up!. <STOP> <START> Nice try, shirttuckers! <STOP> <START> Ow! <STOP> <START> Hi, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Angie. <START> Wayne! <STOP> <START> Oh, my gourd, what a coincidence. <STOP> <START> Oh, I bet you're thinkin' I work here. <STOP> <START> I don't work here. <STOP> <START> I just love Guy's fries. <STOP> <START> They're so crispy, and you add a little salt. <STOP> <START> I just think they're so delicious. <STOP> <START> Ooh! <START> Who is this?

<STOP> <START> Ah, hell, no. <STOP> <START> I hear he's been cutting people's lawns. <STOP> <START> Like that will stop the grass from growing? <STOP> <START> Pitterpatter, let's get down to the real issues here. <STOP> <START> Being President of the Ag Hall is not an entry level job. <STOP> <START> How are ya now? <STOP> <START> Not so qualified. <STOP> <START> Can we really trust a man who can't even be bothered to wear a belt? <STOP> <START> Hell to the nahnah. <STOP> <START> He's just not ready. <STOP> <START> He's just not ready. <STOP> <START> He's just not ready. <STOP> <START> He's just not ready. <STOP> <START> He's just not ready. <STOP> <START> He's just not ready. <STOP> <START> Nice hair, though. <STOP> <START> Nice ass. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> That's what I appreciates about him. <STOP> <START> He's just not ready!. <START> Wayne for president of the Ag Hall?

<STOP> <START> All actors are present. <START> Wondrous! <START> Why are they here? <STOP> <START> Money talks. <STOP> <START> He gave us 50 bucks. <STOP> <START> It's like cutting twoandahalf lawns. <STOP> <START> But we don't even wanna be here, boys. <STOP> <START> You cheated on us, boys. <STOP> <START> Oh, pipe down, Pete and Repeat. <STOP> <START> You were both getting blowies from your big city slams the entire time. <STOP> <START> Dude, who told her about the blowies?

<STOP> <START> Because it's 2015! <STOP> <START> It's not 2015. <STOP> <START> Now, gentlemen, since you are such crafty vets of the chirpslashbeak slashcarve game, I've decided to let you improvise. <START> We're really good. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <START> Wayne, let's start with you. <STOP> <START> Just, um, look directly into the camera and say something slanderous about McMurray. <STOP> <START> Kind of feels like I should make sure my own backyard's clean before throwing junk in someone else's. <STOP> <START> He slandered you first. <START> What, so you think if he goes jumps off a bridge, I'm gonna, too? <STOP> <START> Figure it out. <STOP> <START> Dan? <STOP> <START> Daryl? <STOP> <START> Please help. <STOP> <START> Reilly! <STOP> <START> Jonesy! <STOP> <START> Let's see what you can do. <STOP> <START> Okay. <START> Warm up?

<STOP> <START> Go! <STOP> <START> Kevin Costner. <STOP> <START> Keanu Reeves. <STOP> <START> John Candy. <STOP> <START> Chloe Sevigny. <STOP> <START> It's easy. <STOP> <START> Taylor Kitsch, boys. <STOP> <START> Big Riggins himself. <STOP> <START> You picked Big Riggins, so I'll take Michael Fassbender, bro. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> But if. <STOP> <START> If Big Riggins, if he's not available, 'cause he's my number one, it's easy, Chad Michael Murray, boys. <STOP> <START> Big Riggins is still my number one but I love Chaz Michael, bro. <STOP> <START> One Tree Hill! <STOP> <START> Boom! <STOP> <START> Go with Michael Fassbender. <STOP> <START> Try channeling that. <STOP> <START> Choose Big Riggins. <STOP> <START> You know what? <STOP> <START> Actors named Michael could really reinvent themselves if they change their names to Spike, like uh, Spike Fassbenders or, uh, Spike Caine or Spike J. <STOP> <START> Fox. <STOP> <START> Spike Buble. <STOP> <START> Chaz Spike Murray? <STOP> <START> Oh, C. <STOP> <START> Spike Murray? <STOP> <START> Let's try and stay on task! <START> Well, now it might be kind of awkward, might be kind of awkward if actors named Richards started going by Dick. <STOP> <START> Right? <STOP> <START> Like Dick Gere. <STOP> <START> Dick Pryor. <STOP> <START> Dick Dreyfuss. <STOP> <START> Lionel Dick. <STOP> <START> Feel like Richard Simmons probably prefers Dick. <STOP> <START> Dude, he got fucking mad. <START> Well, looks like she's back to cutting lawns. <STOP> <START> All those for <START> Wayne resuming presidency of the Ag Hall. <STOP> <START> Can I get a one vote here?

<STOP> <START> Or rippsin' a Fun Dip dry one. <START> Well, what's that? <START> Well, in schneef terms, if you do a line of schneef before you've ingested any booze to alter your judgment, it's called doing a dry rip. <STOP> <START> Or rippsin' a dry one. <STOP> <START> Doin' dry rips is a pretty good indication you got a schneef problem. <STOP> <START> You got yourselves a schneef issue. <START> Well, yous ever done a dry rip? <START> Well, back in the day. <STOP> <START> In the glory days. <STOP> <START> Yeah, I done a dry rip. <STOP> <START> I'd a rips a dry one. <STOP> <START> Not sure if rippin' a Fun dip dry rip would have the same effect, but doin' it is still a pretty good indication you got some sort of problem. <START> Well, hoopin' Fun Dip definitely wouldn't have the same effects, but it's definitely an indication you got yourselves a problem. <START> Well, what's hoopin'? <START> Well, that's instead of taking the drugs orally's or intranasally's, you take 'em anally's. <START> What the fuck you talking about now? <START> Well, instead of down the hatch or up the nose, you take 'em in the pooper. <START> Wait, you put drugs up your pooper? <STOP> <START> That's the fastest way to absorbs 'em into your systems. <STOP> <START> Do you mean like you take the drugs with your hand. <START> Well, then you put 'em up your pooper? <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> But you don't poop 'em out? <STOP> <START> No, your pooper absorbs 'em. <START> Well, isn't that curious. <STOP> <START> Hoopin' Fun Dip definitely wouldn't have the same effect as hoopin' schneef. <STOP> <START> But doing it is still probably a pretty good indication you got some sort of a problem. <STOP> <START> I guess a Fun Dip dick dinger wouldn't be the ends of the world. <STOP> <START> You wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I heard my friends J. <STOP> <START> P. and J. <START> W. talk about Fun Dip dick dingers one time. <START> Well, whose dick was gettin' dinged? <START> Well, I thought it was a bit intrusive to ask whose dick was gettin' dinged. <STOP> <START> As long as they're both consentin' adults, it really doesn't matter whose dick's gettin' dinged. <START> Well, I really hope the Fun Dip candy stick isn't going to waste in all this. <STOP> <START> Do you wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I pulled my first allnighter with my friend Chad in grade eight playing Pokemans and eating Fun Dip. <STOP> <START> Oh, waits. <STOP> <START> If. <STOP> <START> If Samuel's already been takin' Fun Dips orally's and intranasally's. <STOP> <START> Yeah, we should probably go check on Samuel. <STOP> <START> I fuckin' hate Samuel so much. <STOP> <START> You got any dates lined up this week, good buddy? <STOP> <START> Nah, I'm gonna put that bullshit on the back burner for a bit, bud. <STOP> <START> Soft, literally. <STOP> <START> Parks 'er behind the barn for a bits? <STOP> <START> Tenply. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Gotta find Stormy a stud. <STOP> <START> That's a priority. <STOP> <START> She's a beautiful dog. <STOP> <START> Oh, she's a real beauty. <STOP> <START> No, she's a gorgeous dog. <STOP> <START> She just tries to kill her studs, is the thing. <START> Well, that's my girl. <STOP> <START> Maybe you should takes her in for a fingers in the bum. <STOP> <START> Are you fuckin' preoccupied? <STOP> <START> That's only the answer sometimes. <STOP> <START> Squirrelly Dan working' Squirrelly OT. <STOP> <START> Not all the time. <STOP> <START> Just to checks. <STOP> <START> Sometimes. <STOP> <START> Are you fuckin' preoccupied? <STOP> <START> Doesn't matter what you takes her in for. <STOP> <START> As sure as a bush is gonna break your fall, Stormy's gonna get some fingers in the bum. <STOP> <START> How deep? <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake. <START> What do ya means, how deep? <STOP> <START> How many knuckles? <STOP> <START> Like how many knuckles deep? <STOP> <START> Yeah, are we talking about a oneknuckler or a twoknuckler? <STOP> <START> Oh, be at least a threeknuckler to gets to the bottom of this. <STOP> <START> Oh, see, now, that's too many. <STOP> <START> Is not. <START> Well, a person's got two knuckles so you're saying that the vet would have to fire a threeknuckler up Stormy's bum to get to the bottom of it? <STOP> <START> A person has three knuckles. <START> Well, a person has two knuckles. <STOP> <START> Figure it out. <STOP> <START> A person has three knuckles. <STOP> <START> You figure it out. <STOP> <START> A person's got two knuckles, okay? <STOP> <START> One, two. <STOP> <START> Three. <STOP> <START> You forgots about the little knuckles underneath the fingernails. <START> Well, see now, that's not a knuckle, though, Dan. <STOP> <START> To be a knuckle, you gotta be able to punch somebody with it. <STOP> <START> You can't punch somebody with the knuckle underneath the fingernail, can you? <STOP> <START> Can too. <START> Well, you'll be looking pretty fuckin' silly. <STOP> <START> First knuckle, one knuckler. <STOP> <START> Second knuckle, twoknuckler. <STOP> <START> Third knuckle, threeknuckler. <STOP> <START> So then by your logic the vet would have to fire a full finger up Stormy's bum to get to the bottom of it. <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> See, I'm just not so goddamn sure I can stand by and watch the vet give Stormy a threeknuckler up the bum. <STOP> <START> No, I don't think Stormy would need a threeknuckler up the bum. <START> Well, thank you, Dary, because then you'd think the vet's a bit funny, would you not? <STOP> <START> Mmm, a person has three knuckles, though. <STOP> <START> Thank you, Dary. <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake, go ahead and have a fuckin' fight with your first knuckle then. <STOP> <START> You'll be lookin' pretty fuckin' silly. <STOP> <START> Yeah, but when we're talkin' about a twoknuckler, we're talking about horizontal knuckles. <STOP> <START> I'm gonna stop you there. <STOP> <START> By your logic, a sixknuckler can be dealt with using these two fingers? <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> Incorrect. <STOP> <START> No such thing as a sixknuckler. <STOP> <START> A sixknuckler existed, I'd know about it. <STOP> <START> How are ya now, Gail? <STOP> <START> Good, and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> Got a stud for Stormy. <STOP> <START> Comes from the Baumgartner breeders. <STOP> <START> Name's Ken. <STOP> <START> Ken Baumgartner? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> You're not exposed to give dogs human names. <STOP> <START> Can do what I want. <START> Well, sure you can, I'm just sayin' you're not exposed to. <STOP> <START> Baumgartner's been breeding German Shepherds out in Chemmy for six years. <STOP> <START> Champion bloodlines. <STOP> <START> Elegance. <STOP> <START> Strength. <STOP> <START> Raw food diet. <STOP> <START> You got him in the truck?

<START> Well, it's the same reason you don't eat the bottom of an ice cream cone. <STOP> <START> Not sure how I feels about this talk. <START> What, do you think they check for bugs down there in the cone factory? <STOP> <START> Fuck, no. <STOP> <START> They just throw the cones in the box. <STOP> <START> Figure it out. <STOP> <START> Can we move past this, please? <START> What, do ya think they check for bugs down there at the cone shop? <STOP> <START> Fuck, no. <STOP> <START> They just throw the ice cream on there. <STOP> <START> Have a good one. <STOP> <START> This conversation's fast becoming a confrontation. <STOP> <START> Like, here, have some ice cream and fucking bugs, likely. <START> What do you do with the bottoms of the ice cream cones? <START> Well, you throw it on the fucking ground, Dan. <STOP> <START> You let the bugs eat it. <STOP> <START> It's the circle of life. <STOP> <START> Didn't you never see The Lion King? <STOP> <START> You know I love The Lion King. <START> We're out of beer. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Beer store's closed. <STOP> <START> Fuck, do I miss MoDean's. <STOP> <START> Reason fucking five million we need some sort of bar in this town. <STOP> <START> Green, blue, and gold?

<STOP> <START> Splash of milk, with three scoops of chocolate ice cream, you got yourself a Frozen Girl Scout. <STOP> <START> Do I look like the type of prick to have a Frozen Girl Scout, Dary? <START> What am I supposed to do with Blue Curacao? <STOP> <START> Mix apple juice, pear juice, garnish with blackberries, you got yourself a Blue Bijou. <STOP> <START> I think I'd rather have a Blue Bijou. <STOP> <START> There's not enough for two. <STOP> <START> Says you. <START> Well, what am I supposed to do with Butter Ripple Schnapps? <START> Well, that's easy, KatyKat. <STOP> <START> Down the hatch. <STOP> <START> I'd be tasting that for days. <START> What's the meaning of this? <STOP> <START> I found it in an old golf bag. <STOP> <START> And why do you get it? <STOP> <START> It's warm. <STOP> <START> It's still a beer. <START> Well, to be fair. <STOP> <START> To be faiuh. <STOP> <START> To be faiuh. <STOP> <START> To be faiuh. <STOP> <START> To be faiuh. <STOP> <START> He is essentially drinking a bottle of piss right now. <STOP> <START> Now, you're no mixologist but your best bet here is to mix 'em all together into what you call donkey juice. <STOP> <START> However, to be faiuh, donkey juice will make you spit. <START> Well, can't win 'em all. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie died. <STOP> <START> Did he? <STOP> <START> Dumdiddydo. <START> Well, you can't win 'em all. <STOP> <START> Mr. <STOP> <START> Letterkenny himself. <STOP> <START> Longeststanding mayor in the history of Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> And you know that snowbird enjoyed the homestretch in Fort Lauderdale. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah, just hanging out down there playing crokinole and shuffleboard with his good pals. <STOP> <START> He was a good guy. <STOP> <START> He was a real good guy. <STOP> <START> He left us a bunch of money. <STOP> <START> Did he? <STOP> <START> Dumdiddydo. <STOP> <START> How much? <STOP> <START> Five K. <START> What a great fucking guy. <STOP> <START> He was a real great fucking guy. <START> Well, he'd want us to have a party. <STOP> <START> He wants us to put it back into the community. <START> What a great fucking guy! <STOP> <START> He says in his will that he's fallen out of touch with the community and he trusts our judgment to give five K some legs around here. <START> Well, sure as God's got sandals. <STOP> <START> So, how do you want to fuck this pig? <START> Well, you'd better put it on your fucking Facebook. <STOP> <START> PitterPatter. <STOP> <START> Let's get at 'er. <STOP> <START> Faster than shit through a goose. <STOP> <START> Licketysplit. <STOP> <START> You've entered the barn, where ideas come to blossom or be ridiculed relentlessly. <STOP> <START> On one side, two nononsense farmers are looking to give away their uncle's money. <STOP> <START> On the other, savvy entrepreneurs hoping to acquire it. <STOP> <START> First up, three degens from Letterkenny are hoping to sell the farmers on their solution for a common smalltown problem. <STOP> <START> Hi, Bonnie. <STOP> <START> Hi, Katy. <STOP> <START> Hi, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> How are ya now? <STOP> <START> Good and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> Say, thanks for the, uh. <START> Well, the thing you did there. <STOP> <START> No problem, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Any time. <STOP> <START> Good afternoon, hicks. <START> We are asking for. <STOP> <START> Is it true that you have a massive horn? <STOP> <START> Yes. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No?. <STOP> <START> I mean, there's no way that they could possibly know that. <STOP> <START> I saw Stewart's penis at the Elmira pool on my 11th birthday. <STOP> <START> Looked like a 12ounce cut of pork tenderloin hanging there. <STOP> <START> Erroneous. <STOP> <START> I saw Stewart's penis when we touched tubes, as normal, inquisitive, young boys do, and it looked six pool balls were stuck inside a gym sock, hanging there. <STOP> <START> Unverified. <STOP> <START> Told ya. <STOP> <START> Fuck! <START> We are asking for five K for 66.6% of our company. <STOP> <START> Outstanding. <START> We want to give back to the community by helping people get sober. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie got sober as a birthday present to himself on his 90th. <START> Which was curious, 'cause he'd come that far, right? <STOP> <START> I should say. <STOP> <START> And we plan on doing this by getting the biggest disasters in Letterkenny, and putting them in a room with cameras. <STOP> <START> From there, we film their friends and family telling them they must halt said disastery, posthaste! <STOP> <START> Is disastery a word? <STOP> <START> It's a band name. <STOP> <START> Quantifiable. <START> Want to know what? <STOP> <START> It feels like I might have seen something like this on a TV show one time. <START> We've arranged a demo of how this might work. <START> We have? <STOP> <START> Stewart, you are such a disastery that sometimes you don't even know if it's a weekday or the weekend. <STOP> <START> It hurts me to see you being such a disaster. <STOP> <START> I wish you could go back to being only a mild disaster. <STOP> <START> Love, Devon. <STOP> <START> This antic was not discussed or rehearsed. <STOP> <START> Stewart, I worry that your disastery is the result of when we touched tubes as young boys. <STOP> <START> I think about touching tubes with you and sometimes wish I could go back in time and not touch tubes. <STOP> <START> Perhaps had we not touched tubes, you wouldn't be such a disaster. <STOP> <START> Love, Roald. <STOP> <START> Drollery was to be left on the cuttingroom floor. <STOP> <START> Anywho. <STOP> <START> Your idea comes from a good place, but Uncle Eddie always believed that if a man needs help, he'll ask. <STOP> <START> He won't be told. <STOP> <START> And for that reason, I'm out. <STOP> <START> Sounds like touching tubes was a pretty big setback for Stewart, but your pitch was the real disaster. <STOP> <START> I'm out. <STOP> <START> So, do we win? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, these winners of the genetic lottery with no more than an ounce of gray matter between them, hope the farmers get behind their plan for young people in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> So, are you just going to do that every time, then, Bonnie? <START> Well, if you want me to, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Yes, please. <STOP> <START> You got it, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Thank you. <STOP> <START> Good afternoon, <START> Wayne, and shewedonotspeakof. <STOP> <START> Oh, piss off. <STOP> <START> You both took down your team's student trainer on her kinesiology coop. <STOP> <START> How'd she find out about. <STOP> <START> Shh! <STOP> <START> There's hope for you yet, boys. <START> We are here asking for five K for 49% of our company. <STOP> <START> Super. <START> We want to give back to the community by investing in the youth, boys. <STOP> <START> Really hustle for the youth, boys. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie loved kids. <STOP> <START> His only shortcoming, really. <START> We want to take the toughest youth in Letterkenny and put them into a house together, with a gym and with a pool. <STOP> <START> There, they'll work out together while receiving instructions from coaches, Joint Boy and Tyson. <STOP> <START> They will then fight each other one by one to find out who is, in fact, the toughest kid in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> This concept sounds a bit familiar. <STOP> <START> No, it's a fresh concept, ferda. <STOP> <START> Ferda fresh. <START> Well, I'm trying to wrap my head around this, so I've got a few questions, here. <STOP> <START> So, you want to put a bunch of dudes in a house together? <STOP> <START> Yes. <STOP> <START> They'll be wearing only gym shorts, as you can see in the poster. <STOP> <START> And then you'll have all these dudes work out together? <STOP> <START> Yes, and they'll always be shirtless 'cause there's no AC. <STOP> <START> It's hot. <STOP> <START> Then when all these dudes are done working out together, they can go swimming together? <STOP> <START> Oh, we'll teach them how to wrestle, too. <STOP> <START> Hold downs, full mount, top control. <STOP> <START> Throw some booze in the house. <STOP> <START> They can have a drink together. <START> What are you really trying to accomplish here, boys?. <STOP> <START> Great presentation. <STOP> <START> I really love the bulletin board with all the sweaty dudes. <STOP> <START> You can just leave that here. <STOP> <START> But I don't think that Uncle Eddie would say, Katy, great investment in sweaty dudes. <STOP> <START> And for that reason, I'm out. <STOP> <START> You want to know what? <STOP> <START> I'm just going to come right out and say it, and you can take that bulletin board with you, please and thanks. <STOP> <START> This idea's a tad fruityloops. <STOP> <START> And for that reason, oh, I'm out. <START> What?. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, this bartender turned dogbreeder hopes Cupid will find his way to Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> Say, Bonnie, could I get you anything? <STOP> <START> A glass of water, or. <STOP> <START> I'm okay, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Thanks, though. <START> Well, if you change your mind, you can just run to the house there, help yourself. <STOP> <START> Maybe I will run over then. <STOP> <START> Can I get you anything? <START> Well, no, I'm okay. <STOP> <START> Do you want anything from the. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <START> Wet your whistle. <STOP> <START> No, I'm good. <STOP> <START> I got some water. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> No, we're okay. <STOP> <START> Thank you, Bonnie. <STOP> <START> Cool, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Good afternoon, <START> Wayne, Katy. <STOP> <START> Gail, how are you now? <STOP> <START> Good, and you? <START> Well, not so bad. <STOP> <START> I'm asking for five K for 69% of my company. <START> Why 69? <STOP> <START> Both sides benefit. <STOP> <START> Good enough. <STOP> <START> I want to give back to the community by helping people find love. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie was a notorious matchmaker. <STOP> <START> And a real fucking legend on the D floor right up till the bitter end. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And I plan on doing that by putting 20 women from Letterkenny into a house with you, and having 'em all compete for your hand in marriage. <START> Who, me? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <START> Well, get after it. <STOP> <START> Isn't this already a reality series? <STOP> <START> If it is, no one watches it. <START> Well, I'd fucking watch it, boy howdy. <STOP> <START> I'll have the girls perform campy tasks and complete silly challenges to prove their mettle. <START> Well, that sounds fun. <STOP> <START> Unnecessary, but go on. <STOP> <START> Then you'd go on group dates with them and oneonone dates with them. <STOP> <START> And then you ax them one by one until you decide which one you want to marry. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> I'm not sure it's reasonable that he could choose a wife based just on that. <STOP> <START> I know. <STOP> <START> Tastes good, but where's the cream filling? <STOP> <START> Like a Boston cream? <STOP> <START> Canadian maple's better. <START> Well, that's a Texassized 104. <STOP> <START> Here's the kicker. <START> When it gets down to the final three girls, deal is, you get to go to their houses and meet their families. <STOP> <START> See? <STOP> <START> Now that's reasonable. <STOP> <START> And then you get to spend a night with each of them, until you decide which one you want to marry. <STOP> <START> Is that. <STOP> <START> Does she. <START> With all three? <STOP> <START> Does she mean. <STOP> <START> After the. <START> Well, maybe it means that I would have to. <STOP> <START> I don't want to talk about it, just ask her. <STOP> <START> Okay, I'll ask her. <STOP> <START> You want to know what? <STOP> <START> I got some fucking questions here. <STOP> <START> Shaboink! <STOP> <START> Now, when you say I spend the night with three of them, is it implied I have sex with all three of them? <STOP> <START> Sure is. <STOP> <START> So, I meet their families. <STOP> <START> Then we go have sex. <STOP> <START> I do that with three of them, before deciding which one I want to marry? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do the girls know going into the process that I will be having sex with them and two other girls before deciding which one I want to marry? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Maybe more. <STOP> <START> And do the girls' families, who I've just met, also know, going into the process, that I will be having sex with their daughters, as well as two other girls who are not their daughters, before deciding which one I want to marry? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And the girls, and their families, find this process entirely rational, despite how selfharming, healthhazardous, and humiliating it very likely will be? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do you say 20 girls, and their families will happily sign up for this process? <STOP> <START> Over and over, I imagine. <STOP> <START> Oh, Gail, I don't want to date a girl like that, for fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> Comes from a family like that. <STOP> <START> Fuck. <STOP> <START> Gail, could there be a female version where there's one girl and 20 dudes? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> I'm in. <STOP> <START> No! <STOP> <START> Ew! <STOP> <START> You're out. <STOP> <START> And do you want to know what? <START> What? <STOP> <START> I'm out. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, this husband and wife pair from RR2 Letterkenny wants to go hunting for buried treasure. <STOP> <START> Bonnie! <STOP> <START> Bonnie! <STOP> <START> Did ya feed the dog? <STOP> <START> Yes! <STOP> <START> Oh, well, thank you. <STOP> <START> Jim Dickins, how are you now? <STOP> <START> Good, and you? <STOP> <START> Oh, not so bad. <STOP> <START> McMurray, how are. <START> Wayne, how are. <START> Well, good. <START> Well, I'm good and. <STOP> <START> I'm not so. <STOP> <START> Oh, not so. <STOP> <START> Uh. <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> Go ahead. <STOP> <START> You, you were first so. <STOP> <START> No, why don't you go ahead? <STOP> <START> Oh, I didn't want to be impolite. <STOP> <START> Just start talking, please, McMurray. <STOP> <START> So you can go ahead and start. <STOP> <START> If you're going to go first, then it would be your turn. <STOP> <START> Just pretend what I had to say wasn't important. <STOP> <START> You're here to pitch, are you not? <STOP> <START> Are you sure you don't want to say anything? <STOP> <START> Jesus, PitterPatter, McMurray! <STOP> <START> Good enough. <STOP> <START> Have at 'er. <STOP> <START> Yip, yip, yip. <STOP> <START> Now, we are asking for five K for 5% of our business. <STOP> <START> Okay. <START> We want to give back to the community by helping them cocksuckers get rich. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie used to buy lottery tickets for the seniors at the home every week. <STOP> <START> MRS. <STOP> <START> And we want to goddamn do that by auctioning off other people's shit. <STOP> <START> Bingo. <STOP> <START> Did you know that there are storage facilities surrounding Letterkenny that are filled with other people's useless piles of their shit, that they have forgotten about? <STOP> <START> Abandoned it, baby. <STOP> <START> They abandoned their shit. <STOP> <START> Abandoned their shit. <STOP> <START> Now, whose knob do I got to polish to get a cocksucking gin and tonic around here? <STOP> <START> All right. <START> We have secured the auctioneering right for these such storage facilities with the help of our friend, Jimmy Dickskin. <STOP> <START> Dickins. <STOP> <START> That's exactly what I said. <STOP> <START> So, what we want to do is we want to take people down there and have them rummage through all the shit and then buy some of the stuff and probably, more than likely, most definitely, find hidden treasures, gold and jewels. <STOP> <START> And I'd settle for a Tom Collins, if it'll get this rig rolling. <STOP> <START> So, you want to sell other people's shit that they left in their storage locker. <STOP> <START> Abandoned. <STOP> <START> Abandoned. <STOP> <START> Things that they abandoned. <STOP> <START> But it's a storage locker and nobody's got any good shit in there. <STOP> <START> You would be surprised. <STOP> <START> I'm never surprised. <START> Well, you will be once we show you a demonstration of one such storage locker that we have brought down from the tiny town of Tiverton. <STOP> <START> Baby, if you will. <STOP> <START> Shall I call you Vanna, for a little roleplay? <STOP> <START> Uhhuh, baby, you know what I mean? <STOP> <START> All right, and a one, and a two, and a three, Jimmy Dickskin! <STOP> <START> Got a beautiful set of DVDs. <STOP> <START> To start the bidding. <STOP> <START> DVDs galore, look at that. <STOP> <START> One, two, three, four, five. <STOP> <START> That's $50 guaranteed for sure for DVDs alone. <STOP> <START> Then we got a VCR. <STOP> <START> That's a vintage VCR. <STOP> <START> Guaranteed $50 for that sweet piece of machinery right then and there. <STOP> <START> Maybe 100, maybe 150. <STOP> <START> No big problem. <START> What else have we got, baby?

<STOP> <START> Hmm. <START> Well, safe to say, if you have to ask for permission it's an inappropriate fart, but I'll still give you a half a point. <STOP> <START> The cheekiness. <STOP> <START> The indecencys of it. <STOP> <START> It's downright abusives, is what it is! <STOP> <START> Hey. <STOP> <START> Is that any way to talk to a guy with two and a half points?

<STOP> <START> Now, no one likes beatin' up degens more than you, so we figured we'd give you a dang. <STOP> <START> Tyson, Joint Boy, youse helped us put up the shack, so only makes sense you help us defend it. <STOP> <START> Now, they got us on the weekend. <START> We should nip this in the bud now, before they get the rest of Letterkenny. <START> Well, that's all fine and dandy, <START> Wayne, but I had to hire a hand to do the chores in my absence. <STOP> <START> You'll have to cover his wages. <STOP> <START> Same. <STOP> <START> I'm on nights right now. <STOP> <START> That's double time. <STOP> <START> You should try EI. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' degens from up country. <STOP> <START> It's costing us money to beat the shit out of these degens. <START> Wells, if we wants to beats the shits out of 'em so bad that they nevers come backs, we're gonna need these guys. <STOP> <START> You know degens, they always come back. <STOP> <START> See, they're always coming back, is the thing. <STOP> <START> PitterPatter. <STOP> <START> Bought and paid for, for fuck sake. <STOP> <START> Dary. <START> We're gonna advertise a party for degens, egg huckers, nose pickers, mailbox ruiners. <STOP> <START> And what we're gonna do is hide in degen blinds, which are very similar to deer blinds. <STOP> <START> And we are gonna put one right here. <STOP> <START> And over there, and there, and here. <STOP> <START> And that way, when the degens come rolling up on their sleds, we jump out of those degen blinds, and beat the shit out of them. <START> Well, that's a good idea, Dary, except it's Tuesday. <STOP> <START> It sounds more like a Friday night thing, or even a Saturday night thing, or even a Sunday thing if you're squirrelly. <STOP> <START> Can't forget, of course, thirsty Thursdays. <STOP> <START> It's fuckin' Tuesday. <STOP> <START> I'd have a gagger right now. <STOP> <START> Now, I'm no American sniper style troubleshooter, but I'd say the next step is to discuss a stronger lure to get them out here. <START> Well, whats do degens loves? <START> Well, besides nosepickin', pissin' outside, nothing. <START> Well, there are many things that if you were to watch the evening news, you would stop and say to yourself, <START> What a fuckin' degenerate son of a bitch. <STOP> <START> I would say at the top of the list would probably be. <STOP> <START> Racists. <STOP> <START> God damn right. <STOP> <START> Racists is definitely degens. <STOP> <START> That's right, big hoss. <STOP> <START> Exactly. <STOP> <START> So, here's what we could do. <STOP> <START> Now, hear me out, just hear me out. <START> What we could do is we advertise a party for ethnicities out here at the shack. <STOP> <START> And we could use the ethnicities to lure out the degens that we wants to beat the shits out of. <STOP> <START> Fuck sakes, that's offsides. <START> Well, you didn't let me finish, Boss Hogg. <STOP> <START> So, what we could do, okay, is once we bring the ethnicities out here, we could beat up the degens before they could try to beat up the ethnicities. <STOP> <START> You're still walkin' a super fine line there, big chief. <STOP> <START> You didn't let me finish. <STOP> <START> See, what we can do now, is have the ethnicities help us beat up the degens like some kind of fantasy revenge of love of asswhooping. <STOP> <START> I guess I've seen that in a Quentin Tarantino film one or three times. <STOP> <START> Abort. <STOP> <START> There is that one thing you see in the news and immediately think, <START> What a fuckin' degenerate. <START> Well, to be fair. <STOP> <START> To be fair. <STOP> <START> To be fair. <STOP> <START> To be fair. <STOP> <START> There's more than a couple of things. <STOP> <START> Homophobists. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Yeah, no. <STOP> <START> Homophobes is definitely degens. <STOP> <START> You mean, like gaybashing. <STOP> <START> That's the one. <STOP> <START> That's the worst. <STOP> <START> Yeah, you're right. <STOP> <START> That is so gay. <START> Wait, that there is homophobics. <START> Who is? <STOP> <START> The less you say now, the less you have to apologize for later. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> You see, Professor Tricia from my women's studies class teaches us that homophobia is not just condemning homosexualitys, but it's also not using the appropriate and preferred terms what homosexuals likes to be called by. <STOP> <START> Yeah, but they call themselves twinks sometimes. <STOP> <START> Like, I'd be offended by that. <STOP> <START> I might be offended by that, too. <STOP> <START> You see, where I'm from, sometimes when people think things are dumb or stupid, they just say that it's gay. <STOP> <START> Yeah, but you're not exposed to say that anymore. <STOP> <START> Are you a homophobes? <STOP> <START> No. <START> Well, 'cause what you said was definitely homophobics. <STOP> <START> Fucks this is a lot of work. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> It's like pickin' stones and doin' hay all at once. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' degens. <STOP> <START> I'm pretty sure you're a homophobist. <STOP> <START> I beat the shit out of you one time for beating up a gay. <STOP> <START> Yeah, I didn't know he was gay. <STOP> <START> He called me a fag. <START> Well, this certainly has come full circle. <STOP> <START> Yeah, see, but youse being offendeds at being calleds a fag, is also technically homophobics. <STOP> <START> I'm gonna take a fuckin' migraine here. <START> Well, see, where I'm from. <START> We all knows where youse comes from, McMurray, but times they are a changin'. <STOP> <START> I think we can all agree here that homophobists are degenerates. <STOP> <START> You call the rest a misunderstanding. <STOP> <START> Call it a fuckin' day here. <STOP> <START> Ah, you had good intentions. <START> Well, wait, just so I understand here, using gays to lure degens out here is just as bad, if not worse, than using ethnicities to lure degens out here that we wants to beats the shit out of? <STOP> <START> Christ sake. <STOP> <START> And Tyson didn't even say that the gays would help us beat up the degens, where the ethnicities would. <STOP> <START> So, I think it's obvious here, boys, my idea has a clear edge. <STOP> <START> Mmm, I think it's quite obvious that using human lures is pretty extreme. <STOP> <START> I'd really likes for you to meet Professor Tricia. <STOP> <START> Okay, so using gays is homophobic. <STOP> <START> Tip of the iceberg, bud. <START> What about, fake gays? <START> Well, what's a fake gays? <START> Well, someone who may appear to be gay, but is not actually gay. <STOP> <START> And therefore, it would not be gaybashing. <START> Well, yes, you'd wanna avoid a hate crime if you could. <STOP> <START> So, you wants to use fake gays to lures the degens? <STOP> <START> Perhaps. <STOP> <START> Okay, listen. <STOP> <START> Just so long as everyone's heard my messages loud and clears. <STOP> <START> I thinks I can lives with that. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> This has been very diplomatic and rational. <STOP> <START> I think the next step in the order of business here, would be to go and find some fake gays for these degenerates to beat up. <STOP> <START> I know where to look. <STOP> <START> Put a fuckin' shirt on. <STOP> <START> Barts. <STOP> <START> Yorkie. <STOP> <START> Schultzy. <STOP> <START> Fisky. <STOP> <START> Katy?

<STOP> <START> Now, no one likes beatin' up degens more than you, so we figured we'd give you a dang. <STOP> <START> Tyson, Joint Boy, youse helped us put up the shack, so only makes sense you help us defend it. <STOP> <START> Now, they got us on the weekend. <START> We should nip this in the bud now, before they get the rest of Letterkenny. <START> Well, that's all fine and dandy, <START> Wayne, but I had to hire a hand to do the chores in my absence. <STOP> <START> You'll have to cover his wages. <STOP> <START> Same. <STOP> <START> I'm on nights right now. <STOP> <START> That's double time. <STOP> <START> You should try EI. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' degens from up country. <STOP> <START> It's costing us money to beat the shit out of these degens. <START> Wells, if we wants to beats the shits out of 'em so bad that they nevers come backs, we're gonna need these guys. <STOP> <START> You know degens, they always come back. <STOP> <START> See, they're always coming back, is the thing. <STOP> <START> PitterPatter. <STOP> <START> Bought and paid for, for fuck sake. <STOP> <START> Dary. <START> We're gonna advertise a party for degens, egg huckers, nose pickers, mailbox ruiners. <STOP> <START> And what we're gonna do is hide in degen blinds, which are very similar to deer blinds. <STOP> <START> And we are gonna put one right here. <STOP> <START> And over there, and there, and here. <STOP> <START> And that way, when the degens come rolling up on their sleds, we jump out of those degen blinds, and beat the shit out of them. <START> Well, that's a good idea, Dary, except it's Tuesday. <STOP> <START> It sounds more like a Friday night thing, or even a Saturday night thing, or even a Sunday thing if you're squirrelly. <STOP> <START> Can't forget, of course, thirsty Thursdays. <STOP> <START> It's fuckin' Tuesday. <STOP> <START> I'd have a gagger right now. <STOP> <START> Now, I'm no American sniper style troubleshooter, but I'd say the next step is to discuss a stronger lure to get them out here. <START> Well, whats do degens loves? <START> Well, besides nosepickin', pissin' outside, nothing. <START> Well, there are many things that if you were to watch the evening news, you would stop and say to yourself, <START> What a fuckin' degenerate son of a bitch. <STOP> <START> I would say at the top of the list would probably be. <STOP> <START> Racists. <STOP> <START> God damn right. <STOP> <START> Racists is definitely degens. <STOP> <START> That's right, big hoss. <STOP> <START> Exactly. <STOP> <START> So, here's what we could do. <STOP> <START> Now, hear me out, just hear me out. <START> What we could do is we advertise a party for ethnicities out here at the shack. <STOP> <START> And we could use the ethnicities to lure out the degens that we wants to beat the shits out of. <STOP> <START> Fuck sakes, that's offsides. <START> Well, you didn't let me finish, Boss Hogg. <STOP> <START> So, what we could do, okay, is once we bring the ethnicities out here, we could beat up the degens before they could try to beat up the ethnicities. <STOP> <START> You're still walkin' a super fine line there, big chief. <STOP> <START> You didn't let me finish. <STOP> <START> See, what we can do now, is have the ethnicities help us beat up the degens like some kind of fantasy revenge of love of asswhooping. <STOP> <START> I guess I've seen that in a Quentin Tarantino film one or three times. <STOP> <START> Abort. <STOP> <START> There is that one thing you see in the news and immediately think, <START> What a fuckin' degenerate. <START> Well, to be fair. <STOP> <START> To be fair. <STOP> <START> To be fair. <STOP> <START> To be fair. <STOP> <START> There's more than a couple of things. <STOP> <START> Homophobists. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Yeah, no. <STOP> <START> Homophobes is definitely degens. <STOP> <START> You mean, like gaybashing. <STOP> <START> That's the one. <STOP> <START> That's the worst. <STOP> <START> Yeah, you're right. <STOP> <START> That is so gay. <START> Wait, that there is homophobics. <START> Who is? <STOP> <START> The less you say now, the less you have to apologize for later. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> You see, Professor Tricia from my women's studies class teaches us that homophobia is not just condemning homosexualitys, but it's also not using the appropriate and preferred terms what homosexuals likes to be called by. <STOP> <START> Yeah, but they call themselves twinks sometimes. <STOP> <START> Like, I'd be offended by that. <STOP> <START> I might be offended by that, too. <STOP> <START> You see, where I'm from, sometimes when people think things are dumb or stupid, they just say that it's gay. <STOP> <START> Yeah, but you're not exposed to say that anymore. <STOP> <START> Are you a homophobes? <STOP> <START> No. <START> Well, 'cause what you said was definitely homophobics. <STOP> <START> Fucks this is a lot of work. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> It's like pickin' stones and doin' hay all at once. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' degens. <STOP> <START> I'm pretty sure you're a homophobist. <STOP> <START> I beat the shit out of you one time for beating up a gay. <STOP> <START> Yeah, I didn't know he was gay. <STOP> <START> He called me a fag. <START> Well, this certainly has come full circle. <STOP> <START> Yeah, see, but youse being offendeds at being calleds a fag, is also technically homophobics. <STOP> <START> I'm gonna take a fuckin' migraine here. <START> Well, see, where I'm from. <START> We all knows where youse comes from, McMurray, but times they are a changin'. <STOP> <START> I think we can all agree here that homophobists are degenerates. <STOP> <START> You call the rest a misunderstanding. <STOP> <START> Call it a fuckin' day here. <STOP> <START> Ah, you had good intentions. <START> Well, wait, just so I understand here, using gays to lure degens out here is just as bad, if not worse, than using ethnicities to lure degens out here that we wants to beats the shit out of? <STOP> <START> Christ sake. <STOP> <START> And Tyson didn't even say that the gays would help us beat up the degens, where the ethnicities would. <STOP> <START> So, I think it's obvious here, boys, my idea has a clear edge. <STOP> <START> Mmm, I think it's quite obvious that using human lures is pretty extreme. <STOP> <START> I'd really likes for you to meet Professor Tricia. <STOP> <START> Okay, so using gays is homophobic. <STOP> <START> Tip of the iceberg, bud. <START> What about, fake gays? <START> Well, what's a fake gays? <START> Well, someone who may appear to be gay, but is not actually gay. <STOP> <START> And therefore, it would not be gaybashing. <START> Well, yes, you'd wanna avoid a hate crime if you could. <STOP> <START> So, you wants to use fake gays to lures the degens? <STOP> <START> Perhaps. <STOP> <START> Okay, listen. <STOP> <START> Just so long as everyone's heard my messages loud and clears. <STOP> <START> I thinks I can lives with that. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> This has been very diplomatic and rational. <STOP> <START> I think the next step in the order of business here, would be to go and find some fake gays for these degenerates to beat up. <STOP> <START> I know where to look. <STOP> <START> Put a fuckin' shirt on. <STOP> <START> Barts. <STOP> <START> Yorkie. <STOP> <START> Schultzy. <STOP> <START> Fisky. <STOP> <START> Katy?

<STOP> <START> Your boots are covered in piss. <STOP> <START> Are you accusing me of washing my boots in the toilet again? <STOP> <START> All dudes' shoes are covered in piss. <STOP> <START> From standin' in front of the toilet or a urinal. <STOP> <START> Your stream hits the water or the porcelain and it goes fuckin' everywhere. <STOP> <START> Prove it. <STOP> <START> No, he's right. <STOP> <START> Have you ever taken a look at the area half a foot in fronts of a urinal? <STOP> <START> It's like a miniature swamps. <STOP> <START> Ants could ride seadoos through it. <STOP> <START> Ants can't ride no seadoos. <STOP> <START> Of course ants can't ride no seadoos! <STOP> <START> Just don't let the dog lick your boots. <STOP> <START> I mean not to be an expert on the subject, 'cause of course, everybody's a fuckin' expert. <STOP> <START> Everybody's a fuckin' expert. <STOP> <START> Must be nice. <STOP> <START> You know, when I was coming up we'd be lucky to even have a dog. <STOP> <START> Now everyone's a fuckin' expert. <STOP> <START> Must be nice. <STOP> <START> You guys notice that whenever there's a problem everybody turns into a dog expert? <START> We oughtta leave this world behind. <STOP> <START> Maybe they could. <STOP> <START> Maybe who could? <STOP> <START> Ants. <STOP> <START> Could what? <STOP> <START> Ride seadoos. <STOP> <START> Good buddy? <STOP> <START> See, there's a lot of variables at play here, obviously. <STOP> <START> But if you ask me if I've heard crazier things than ants riding seadoos. <STOP> <START> I'd say sure. <STOP> <START> You'd need a scientist. <STOP> <START> You'd need a team of scientists, I think. <START> Well, ants are smart enough to walk single file and protect their queen. <STOP> <START> So, you know, they're just a stone's throw away from humans intelligencewise. <STOP> <START> They're a hop, skip and a jump, if you really think about it. <STOP> <START> You get a scientist to make a seadoo for an ant? <START> Well, I think a team of scientists, a good one, for sure could. <STOP> <START> A scientist making seadoos for ants would be a tireless job. <STOP> <START> Thankless, likely, too. <START> Well, you operates the gas with your thumb on the seadoo so, ants don't got thumbs. <STOP> <START> That right there is your first obstacles. <STOP> <START> No, you'd have to get scientists to make the gas a push button so the ant could just put his foot on it. <STOP> <START> It's like if a team of scientists was building a seadoo for an ant, they could likely just as easily build the ant a bionic thumb to operate the gas with. <STOP> <START> So, there's options there. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Ant would need a license to operate a personal watercraft. <STOP> <START> That's not a big deal. <STOP> <START> You can get that over the weekend. <STOP> <START> But the scientists would have to build them a PFD because they wouldn't let them take the course without it. <STOP> <START> Ants would have no problem stabilizing themselves out on the seadoo on accounts that they got more arms and legs than we do. <STOP> <START> They've got a leg up on us there, if you wants to be clever about it. <STOP> <START> If I'm an ant I'm operating the seadoo with my antennas. <STOP> <START> That way I've got all those arms and legs to stabilize myself on the machine, which you'd need like, if it's a wavy day on the water. <STOP> <START> It'd still take a lot of concentration from an ant. <STOP> <START> Like Dan's gonna fall off two or three times when he gets going. <STOP> <START> So it's just trial and error. <STOP> <START> I don't know. <STOP> <START> You don't know what? <START> Well, think about Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. <STOP> <START> Think about how helpful and resilient the ant was the entire journey. <START> Well, know what, I'm just gonna come right out and say it, the kids might never have got unshrunk if it weren't for the ant. <STOP> <START> That's all well and good, but I'm actually quite surprised you guys would suggest that the ants would just up and abandon his post protecting the queen to go ride on seadoos. <START> Well, you don't know that ant, Dan. <STOP> <START> You know nothing about the ant, Dan. <STOP> <START> That's rather presumptuous of youse. <STOP> <START> You're an ant comin' up in a tough neighbourhood. <STOP> <START> Never caught a break in your life. <STOP> <START> All of a sudden there's a team of scientists outside your door with a seadoo. <STOP> <START> Dan, look me in the eye right now and tell me you don't ride it. <STOP> <START> The ant's buddies would be thrilled to help him out. <STOP> <START> They'd happily cover his shift protecting the queen. <STOP> <START> An opportunity like that? <STOP> <START> They'd be linin' up around the anthill. <STOP> <START> How many more opportunities like that you think the ant's going to get? <STOP> <START> Not many. <STOP> <START> That's the first ant in the colony to ride a seadoo. <STOP> <START> That's his legacy. <STOP> <START> They'd be talking about that ant intercolonial. <STOP> <START> Fire ants wouldn't fuck with him. <STOP> <START> He rides seadoos. <START> What's the alternative? <STOP> <START> Yeah, what's the alternative? <START> Work on an ant farm? <STOP> <START> That ant's got a life on the outside, he's got to live it God dammit. <STOP> <START> His hours might have got cut. <STOP> <START> He might have mouths to feed. <STOP> <START> You don't know. <STOP> <START> His wife's thinking about leaving, taking the kids too. <STOP> <START> I was out of line. <START> Well, good people make mistakes, Dan. <STOP> <START> Yeah, it's all right. <STOP> <START> Just. just like, I don't know, like, down the road, I think, if you hear somebody talkin' about somebody that they don't really know, you'll swiftly correct them. <STOP> <START> I think it's important that they just learn something here. <STOP> <START> Not to be an expert, 'cause everybody's a fuckin' expert. <STOP> <START> Must be nice. <STOP> <START> Can you get me some sour candies? <STOP> <START> Sure, KatyKat. <STOP> <START> You got him well trained, don't ya? <START> Wayne, how'r ya now. <STOP> <START> Not s'bad. <STOP> <START> Good 'n you? <STOP> <START> Now. now hold on, <START> Wayne, <START> Wayne. <START> Wayne, we aint' got time for the pleasantries, all right? <STOP> <START> Youse guys heard what the hockey coach is up to at the golf course? <STOP> <START> Fuck golf. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' ankle sock wearin' sallies, that's all I know. <STOP> <START> That fuckin' twat says there's too much shits from Canada Gooses on the golf course. <STOP> <START> There's too much shit from Canada Gooses everywhere. <STOP> <START> Just keep your dog out of it and keep walkin'. <STOP> <START> Exactly. <STOP> <START> But get this. <STOP> <START> To curb the amount of shits from Canada Gooses, that degenerate sonofabitch has put the wheels in motion to oil and grease up the eggs! <STOP> <START> Hot Jimmy! <START> What the fuck ya talkin' about oil and grease up the eggs? <STOP> <START> They track down the Canada Gooses nests, put oil on Canada Gooses eggs so they won't hatch. <STOP> <START> Oh!. <START> What?! <STOP> <START> So mother Canada Gooses sit on their eggs and wait diligently for them to Hatch, but they never hatch. <STOP> <START> Canada Gooseslings die inside the egg. <START> What?! <START> What?! <START> What?! <START> What?! <STOP> <START> I've never been so irate in my whole fuckin' life! <STOP> <START> You fuck with mother nature! <STOP> <START> You don't fuck with it, cocksucker. <STOP> <START> You don't fuck with motherhood! <STOP> <START> There's a special place in heaven for animal lovers, that's all I know. <STOP> <START> Those are fuckin' Canada Gooses. <STOP> <START> Those are Canada's fuckin' gooses. <STOP> <START> Canada Gooses are majestics. <STOP> <START> Barrelchested. <STOP> <START> The envys of all ornithologys. <STOP> <START> They are leaders. <STOP> <START> Born and bred leaders. <STOP> <START> Canada Gooses are vanfuckin'garde. <STOP> <START> Avantfuckin'garde. <STOP> <START> Guardians of the fuckin' galaxy! <STOP> <START> You wanna know what?

<START> We oughtta leave this world behind. <STOP> <START> Canada Gooses mate for life. <STOP> <START> They're just like you and me. <STOP> <START> Those cocksuckers help each other fly when they're in the air. <STOP> <START> They look out for each other. <STOP> <START> Now you wanna kill them for takin' shits. <STOP> <START> You know, I saw two Canada Gooses mount a swan one time and you gotta think that swan told her friends about it. <STOP> <START> You're goddamn right she did. <STOP> <START> I think we all need to take a good look in the mirror and ask ourselves, where we would be without Canada Gooses. <START> We cannot allows this to happen. <START> We will not allow this to happen. <STOP> <START> I'm about ready to put some anthrax in the fuckin' mail here, that's all I know. ooh! <STOP> <START> Settle down, baby. <STOP> <START> Settle down. <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Let's hit the golf course! <STOP> <START> Hey. <STOP> <START> Hey, buddy. <STOP> <START> Oh, hey, buddy. <STOP> <START> You, uh, throwin' some weights around, eh?

<START> Well, I think a team of scientists, a good one, for sure could. <STOP> <START> A scientist making seadoos for ants would be a tireless job. <STOP> <START> Thankless, likely, too. <START> Well, you operates the gas with your thumb on the seadoo so, ants don't got thumbs. <STOP> <START> That right there is your first obstacles. <STOP> <START> No, you'd have to get scientists to make the gas a push button so the ant could just put his foot on it. <STOP> <START> It's like if a team of scientists was building a seadoo for an ant, they could likely just as easily build the ant a bionic thumb to operate the gas with. <STOP> <START> So, there's options there. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Ant would need a license to operate a personal watercraft. <STOP> <START> That's not a big deal. <STOP> <START> You can get that over the weekend. <STOP> <START> But the scientists would have to build them a PFD because they wouldn't let them take the course without it. <STOP> <START> Ants would have no problem stabilizing themselves out on the seadoo on accounts that they got more arms and legs than we do. <STOP> <START> They've got a leg up on us there, if you wants to be clever about it. <STOP> <START> If I'm an ant I'm operating the seadoo with my antennas. <STOP> <START> That way I've got all those arms and legs to stabilize myself on the machine, which you'd need like, if it's a wavy day on the water. <STOP> <START> It'd still take a lot of concentration from an ant. <STOP> <START> Like Dan's gonna fall off two or three times when he gets going. <STOP> <START> So it's just trial and error. <STOP> <START> I don't know. <STOP> <START> You don't know what? <START> Well, think about Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. <STOP> <START> Think about how helpful and resilient the ant was the entire journey. <START> Well, know what, I'm just gonna come right out and say it, the kids might never have got unshrunk if it weren't for the ant. <STOP> <START> That's all well and good, but I'm actually quite surprised you guys would suggest that the ants would just up and abandon his post protecting the queen to go ride on seadoos. <START> Well, you don't know that ant, Dan. <STOP> <START> You know nothing about the ant, Dan. <STOP> <START> That's rather presumptuous of youse. <STOP> <START> You're an ant comin' up in a tough neighbourhood. <STOP> <START> Never caught a break in your life. <STOP> <START> All of a sudden there's a team of scientists outside your door with a seadoo. <STOP> <START> Dan, look me in the eye right now and tell me you don't ride it. <STOP> <START> The ant's buddies would be thrilled to help him out. <STOP> <START> They'd happily cover his shift protecting the queen. <STOP> <START> An opportunity like that? <STOP> <START> They'd be linin' up around the anthill. <STOP> <START> How many more opportunities like that you think the ant's going to get? <STOP> <START> Not many. <STOP> <START> That's the first ant in the colony to ride a seadoo. <STOP> <START> That's his legacy. <STOP> <START> They'd be talking about that ant intercolonial. <STOP> <START> Fire ants wouldn't fuck with him. <STOP> <START> He rides seadoos. <START> What's the alternative? <STOP> <START> Yeah, what's the alternative? <START> Work on an ant farm? <STOP> <START> That ant's got a life on the outside, he's got to live it God dammit. <STOP> <START> His hours might have got cut. <STOP> <START> He might have mouths to feed. <STOP> <START> You don't know. <STOP> <START> His wife's thinking about leaving, taking the kids too. <STOP> <START> I was out of line. <START> Well, good people make mistakes, Dan. <STOP> <START> Yeah, it's all right. <STOP> <START> Just. just like, I don't know, like, down the road, I think, if you hear somebody talkin' about somebody that they don't really know, you'll swiftly correct them. <STOP> <START> I think it's important that they just learn something here. <STOP> <START> Not to be an expert, 'cause everybody's a fuckin' expert. <STOP> <START> Must be nice. <STOP> <START> Can you get me some sour candies?

<STOP> <START> Are we? <STOP> <START> I think we should pump the brakes on Fartbook. <STOP> <START> That's a Texassize 104. <START> Why? <STOP> <START> It's kicking up too much dust. <START> We haven't even gotten into it and already folks are gettin' chapped asses. <START> Well, that's their problem. <STOP> <START> Not ours. <STOP> <START> This is our problem. <START> We started Fartbook so that good folks could share farts with other good folks. <STOP> <START> That's it. <STOP> <START> Not to creepin' farts, or spam farts. <STOP> <START> Although, if you eat spam, you'll get good farts. <STOP> <START> Farts should never come between the love of a man and a woman. <STOP> <START> It's not right. <STOP> <START> You don't get to 500 million farts without making a few sharts. <STOP> <START> Exactly. <STOP> <START> So, what are you saying? <STOP> <START> Fartbook dies today. <STOP> <START> Today, Fartbook is dead. <STOP> <START> Oh. <STOP> <START> You think so? <STOP> <START> I'm with the fellas on this one. <STOP> <START> It's not why we invented it. <STOP> <START> You invented it? <STOP> <START> Our idea. <START> We built the site. <STOP> <START> You know, you really don't need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this. <STOP> <START> If you were the inventors of Fartbook, you'd have invented Fartbook. <STOP> <START> Hold your horses there. <STOP> <START> Let's put this to a vote. <STOP> <START> Those for closing down Fartbook, raise your hands. <STOP> <START> Those against? <STOP> <START> But we own 30 percent. <STOP> <START> This isn't fair! <STOP> <START> If you want to sit on our backs and call yourselves tall, you have every right to do so. <STOP> <START> But don't think that we're gonna sit here and enjoy listening to you lie. <STOP> <START> You have a bit of our attention, you have the smallest bit of our attention. <START> When did we ask for your attention? <STOP> <START> The rest of our attention is back at the offices of Fartbook, where my friends and I are doing things that no one on this farm, especially and including you idiots, are intellectually, creatively, artistically, emotionally, or spiritually capable of doing. <STOP> <START> Have I adequately answered your condescending question? <START> What question?. <STOP> <START> Farts! <STOP> <START> You better lawyer up, asshole, because I'm not coming back for 30 percent, I'm coming back for everything. <STOP> <START> I. <STOP> <START> I don't know what happened just now. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> You know, I've been thinking about Fartbook. <START> What about it, bigshits?. <STOP> <START> I think maybe we pulled the cord too quick on that, you parachute. <STOP> <START> I miss it too, threepoint shoes. <STOP> <START> I was on there a lot. <STOP> <START> Too much, likely. <STOP> <START> I was always checking it. <STOP> <START> It was very addicting. <STOP> <START> Except, did you ever really stop to think about one thing, did you? <STOP> <START> Rippin' farts into your computer doesn't exactly spike the likelihood of having sex with girls. <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Not now. <STOP> <START> Need 20 minutes. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Just wanted to let you know that Glen stole our website. <STOP> <START> It's been live for more than 36 hours. <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Fuck it!. <STOP> <START> Oh! <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> Jesus! <STOP> <START> Fucking sort yourselves out. <STOP> <START> Cheese and rice. <STOP> <START> I can't remember the last time five men came in this church so aggressively. <STOP> <START> Or can I?

<STOP> <START> Stewart, I did not steal anything. <STOP> <START> Because the last time I checked, taking advantage of a growing trend was not stealing. <START> What trend? <STOP> <START> I'll tell you. <STOP> <START> But first, let's sing a hymn. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Fine. <STOP> <START> Look, y'all had a good idea, all right? <STOP> <START> You had a terrific idea. <STOP> <START> Congratulations. <STOP> <START> But did you actually think you were the only ones in the world to have it? <START> What are you talking about? <STOP> <START> I'm talking about Fart culture, Stewart. <STOP> <START> It's all the rage. <STOP> <START> It's everywhere. <STOP> <START> You know. <STOP> <START> Nothing. <STOP> <START> Glen will show you. <STOP> <START> Ever heard of Plenty of Farts?

'Cause you're not supposed to fart in front of girls. <START> What? <STOP> <START> There's certain things that should stay sacred between a man and a woman. <STOP> <START> So, all things considered, this whole thing's pretty fucking juvenile, if I do say so myself. <STOP> <START> If she's always listening to your ass acoustics, or even worse, smellin' 'em, I guarantee she'll be slower and slower to crawl into bed with you at night. <START> What you just said is outrageous. <STOP> <START> No it isn't. <STOP> <START> It's true. <STOP> <START> I don't wanna be smelling a dude's ass all the time. <STOP> <START> Get real. <START> What are you? <STOP> <START> Some kind of fart purist? <STOP> <START> So what are you supposed to do? <STOP> <START> Just hold it in? <STOP> <START> Or take a shit, you fuckin' degenerate. <STOP> <START> Speaking of shit, my second cousin's got IBS. <START> Who, Garrett? <STOP> <START> No, Jarett. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> IBS, the International Business Solution? <STOP> <START> IBS stands for Irritable Bowel Syndromes. <STOP> <START> Anyhoo, when he was a kid, Jackass comes out on the air, so it becomes real popular in his high school, for kids to start taking shits in places what weren't meant for taking shits in. <STOP> <START> They calls that guerrilla shittin'. <STOP> <START> Is this a true story? <STOP> <START> So, he became real popular with his friends, with his ability to take a shits any time he needed to. <STOP> <START> They'd call him up when they get an idea of a place that needed a shits taken in, and be like, Hey, why don't you comes over here and takes a shits? <STOP> <START> Anyhow, this one time his pal texts him up, and he says, Hey, why don't you come take a shits in the girls' bathroom? <STOP> <START> So, he drinks a coffee, eats a bran muffin, heads on down to the washroom there, but when he opens the bathroom door, what does he find?

<START> Well, pitter patter, let's get at 'er. <START> Well, I was wondering if this year we could skip the birthday party? <STOP> <START> Skip your super soft birthday party? <STOP> <START> Are you fuckin' high? <STOP> <START> Hard no. <STOP> <START> Daryl's super soft birthday party? <STOP> <START> Every year, Daryl's mom used to throw him these birthday parties when he was a kid. <STOP> <START> Softest birthday party on planet Earth. <STOP> <START> Boy band karaoke, cupcake decoration station, charcuterie. <STOP> <START> One year, his mom had him a Make the world a better place party. <STOP> <START> One year they dressed a horse up like a unicorn and he was never really the same after that. <STOP> <START> It's not funny. <STOP> <START> I used to take a lot of teasing in school for those. <STOP> <START> Aw, should I get you a tissue, Sally? <STOP> <START> No, he'll have one in his purse. <STOP> <START> Or maybe his clutch. <STOP> <START> Party's happening, Daryl. <STOP> <START> You don't fuck with tradition. <STOP> <START> So. <STOP> <START> The agenda. <STOP> <START> After your dust up over the weekend, safe to assume you're fighting again? <STOP> <START> Corect. <STOP> <START> Tenfour, good buddy. <START> Well, it's gonna be a busy week 'cause there's a few guys walking around town claiming to be the toughest guys in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> I'm the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> You were the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> It's been some time. <STOP> <START> Now, it's safe to assume that that title is as important to you now as it was then? <STOP> <START> Does a duck with a boner drag weeds? <STOP> <START> Tenfour, good buddy! <STOP> <START> Then it's safe to assume that the challengers will be coming up around the farm, as that is how you've conducted business in the past. <START> Well, I was never one for an audience. <STOP> <START> All right, let's talk about the challengers. <STOP> <START> First up, we've got Sled Ted. <START> Why's he called Sled Ted? <START> Well, he likes fixin' sleds, and ridin' sleds, and talkin' about sleds. <STOP> <START> He just really likes sleddin', boys. <STOP> <START> Uh, he beat up a guy named Basic Jay. <START> Why's he called Basic Jay? 'Cause he's a fuckin' basic. <STOP> <START> And now he thinks he's the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> After that, we got Rat Ass. <START> Why's he called Rat Ass? 'Cause he's got a hairy ass like a rat. <STOP> <START> Can confirm. <STOP> <START> He beat up a guy named Brains. <STOP> <START> See, his name's Brian but he spelt it Brain in the computer at bowling one time. <STOP> <START> It just kinda stuck. <STOP> <START> Now he thinks he's the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> And after that, we got Joint Boy. <STOP> <START> Because he smokes lots of joints, Dairy. <START> Well, just plucking the low hanging fruit is what that is. <STOP> <START> I've seen that guy take on four bouncers at the rippers one time. <STOP> <START> He is otherworldly. <STOP> <START> Got a dome on him like an Easter Island statue. <STOP> <START> Is he single? <STOP> <START> Not that it matters, I guess. <STOP> <START> Look, keep it at the end of the lane way. <STOP> <START> No degens on the property. <STOP> <START> That's a Texas size 104. <STOP> <START> Over and out. <START> Well, this is annoying. <STOP> <START> The fuck are they doin' out there? <STOP> <START> They're scared of you. <STOP> <START> This snipe is a fuckin' sniper. <STOP> <START> Snipe's a fuckin' beauty. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' look at this snipe. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' love this snipe. <START> We're snipe selling, boys. <STOP> <START> Dirty fucking dangles, boys. <STOP> <START> You're a sniper. <STOP> <START> You're a snipe. <STOP> <START> You're a skirt, you pansy. <STOP> <START> If you make me walk up the lane way again, we're having babies. <STOP> <START> Put it out! <STOP> <START> Put it out! <STOP> <START> Put it out! <STOP> <START> Fuck! <STOP> <START> Fuck! <STOP> <START> Those boys need to give their balls a tug. <STOP> <START> Maybe, check, make sure they're still attached right quick. <STOP> <START> I'd rather put a mirror down there and see what's what. <STOP> <START> One time, my cousin. <STOP> <START> He tore open his ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick and he had to show it to his mum. <START> Was it his scrotal sack? <START> Well, you know. <STOP> <START> That dangly piece of flesh, what hangs down behind the penis. <STOP> <START> Scrotal sack. <STOP> <START> The nut sack. <STOP> <START> So, he tore his ball sack open trying to do a skateboard trick and he's gots to show it to his mum because apparently one of his testicles was showing. <START> Was it the right one or the left one? <START> Why is that of importance? <START> Well, because the left one has more sperm in it. <STOP> <START> Spermatozoa is what it's called. <STOP> <START> Tell you what, if I ripped open my ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick, I'd be more worried about seeing my vas deferens. <START> Well, you'd have to tear your ball sack pretty near wide open doing a skateboard trick if you wanted to see your own vas deferens. <STOP> <START> I'm not sure I wanna see my own vas deferens I think if I saw my own vas deferens, I'd be quite worried. <STOP> <START> I'd be most worried if I tore my ball sack open trying to do a skateboard trick if I could see my accessory glands. <START> Well, you don't want to go too kooky with accessories on your truck. <STOP> <START> Or your jeep. <STOP> <START> It's okay with like, a quad, though, like my buddy Big T's got a snorkel kit on his and that's pretty punk rock. <START> What's an accessory gland? <START> Well, if your vas deferens is your sperm ducts, the accessory glands is what supplies lubricant to the sperm duct. <STOP> <START> I think if I ripped open my ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick, I'd be most worried about seeing my seminal vesicles. <STOP> <START> Oh, like the Florida State seminal vesicles? <STOP> <START> Like the sack that hangs behind your vas deferens and contains fructose which is energy for the sperm. <STOP> <START> Yeah, it's like when you go in the city there and they got them charge stations for the people that drive the electric cars. <STOP> <START> That's pretty much your seminal vesticles. <STOP> <START> I thought it was pretty funny when I said Florida State seminal vesicles and nobody laughed. <STOP> <START> Hello. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> End of the lane way. <STOP> <START> Don't come up the property. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> Sled Ted's here. <STOP> <START> Geez, Basic Jay must have been a shit fighter to lose to that asshat. <STOP> <START> I've known Basic Jay to be a pretty tough dude. <STOP> <START> He's not really a fuckin' basic. <STOP> <START> Guess he could have had a cold. <STOP> <START> Or the flu. <STOP> <START> Sled Ted had Bigfoot hands. <STOP> <START> Yeah, he's a big grimy brute. <STOP> <START> Shit fighter, though. <STOP> <START> Do you guys remember the fragrance Brut? <STOP> <START> Or Actif Brut? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Yeah, they still make that. <STOP> <START> I always enjoyed that fragrance. <STOP> <START> You can use it to dry up zits too. <STOP> <START> Did you know you can use shaving cream to get permanent marker off your hands? <START> Why wouldn't you just dip your hands in the parts cleaner? <START> Well, most people don't have a parts cleaner. <START> Well, most likely Rat Ass will be your next dude. <STOP> <START> I hear that he is a greaser. <STOP> <START> Can confirm. <STOP> <START> So fuckin' greasy I almost don't want to. <STOP> <START> I saw him with his shirt off, swimming at the gravel pit not that long ago. <STOP> <START> His back acne was extraordinary. <START> Well, like, extraordinary how? <START> Well, like, I thought about it for a while after is all. <START> Well, elaborate, 'cause I'm likely gonna have to touch it. <START> Well, like how it was cultivated. <START> Well, by not showering likely. <STOP> <START> Likely. <STOP> <START> Did you know that men can wear the fragrance CK ONE as well as women? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> That's 'cause it's an unisex fragrance. <STOP> <START> It says that right on the bottle. <STOP> <START> But would ya? <STOP> <START> Oh, negative. <STOP> <START> Me neither. <START> Would you wear Gap Dream?. <STOP> <START> No! <STOP> <START> No, no, Dairy, that's for girls. <STOP> <START> Dairy, that's for girls. <STOP> <START> You can't walk around smelling like pretty girls. <STOP> <START> You're not wearing it right now, are you? <STOP> <START> Cologne is too expensive. <STOP> <START> I just use sunscreen. <STOP> <START> Banana Boat. <STOP> <START> Let's get into some of those fuckin' all dressed chips. <STOP> <START> Jesus, Katy, put some fuckin' clothes on. <STOP> <START> Not my forte. <STOP> <START> Unfortunate. <STOP> <START> Hey, neighbor said he's not gonna give us a horse this year. <START> What? <START> Well, he said that last year we returned him and his breath smelled like alcohol. <START> Well, it was probably mine. <STOP> <START> You could have lit my breath on fire the next day. <STOP> <START> Horse was half cut though. <STOP> <START> He said that he's gonna give us a donkey. <STOP> <START> Nope. <STOP> <START> Might be funny. <STOP> <START> Gotta be a horse. <STOP> <START> You don't fuck with tradition. <STOP> <START> You're really gonna pump the brakes on a donkey dressed up like a unicorn? <STOP> <START> Oh, I'm stompin' the brakes. <STOP> <START> You put that idea right through the fuckin' windshield. <STOP> <START> But it's a donkey dressed up like a unicorn. <STOP> <START> Katy! <START> Well, it's better than a kick in the pants. <STOP> <START> Do you want this to be the softest birthday party ever or not? <STOP> <START> I want this just as much as you do. <START> Well, then find us a horse. <STOP> <START> Please and thank you. <STOP> <START> And don't stay out in the sun too long. <STOP> <START> Your skin will look like an old saddle bag. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Hello. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> End of the lane way. <STOP> <START> Don't come up the property. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> Rat Ass is here. <STOP> <START> Keep it standing. <STOP> <START> This goes to the ground, we stand up. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> This goes to a clinch, we separate. <STOP> <START> Great. <STOP> <START> Let's go! <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> So, hit me. <STOP> <START> Fight him or shut the fuck up. <STOP> <START> I'll give you a free one. <START> What the fuck is this?

<STOP> <START> Do I go inside and spread Angie right out on the bar when she gets here? <STOP> <START> I've fucked your girl more times than you've had a hot meal. <STOP> <START> Maybe your sister wants to join us. <STOP> <START> It's Katy, right? <STOP> <START> Shit. <START> Why don't I go over there and ask her myself? <STOP> <START> Pull your pants up, Alexander. <STOP> <START> You've come this far. <START> Welcome to fuckin' Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> Good to have you back, big brother. <STOP> <START> Hi, Katy. <STOP> <START> Go home, Daryl. <STOP> <START> Bye, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Have a good one bro. <STOP> <START> Bye, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> See you later, buddy. <STOP> <START> A bit of fuss down at the church the other day. <STOP> <START> Glen. <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> How are you now?. <STOP> <START> Good, and you? <STOP> <START> Oh, not so bad. <STOP> <START> Ooh, look what you brought with you. <STOP> <START> Hello, Daryl. <STOP> <START> Oh, fuck. <STOP> <START> Fuck, you're naked as a jay bird. <START> Wayne, it's humid. <STOP> <START> It's the humidity. <STOP> <START> Y'all might want to think about doing the same thing, just pop your pants right off, that way no one gets sticky. <STOP> <START> Nope. <STOP> <START> It's not so bad. <START> What's the fuss? <STOP> <START> Ma O'Dell mentioned something about you helping her get a squirrel out of her attic. <STOP> <START> I'm faced with a similar conundrum. <STOP> <START> Right over there. <STOP> <START> It seems some kinda rodent's made his home over there. <STOP> <START> I have not seen him, but I sure can smell him. <STOP> <START> Hum. <STOP> <START> It's a possum. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> Possum. <STOP> <START> That's right. <STOP> <START> Oh, pitter patter, let's get at 'er. <STOP> <START> Do you wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I'd reach into a pirate hooker's chamber pot before I'd reach in there. <STOP> <START> And I'm going to tell ya. <STOP> <START> Possums are immune to snake venom. <STOP> <START> They could probably survive a nuclear blast. <STOP> <START> I think it's pronounced newcuelar. <STOP> <START> Mmm, but it isn't. <STOP> <START> They're mutants. <STOP> <START> They have forked fuckin' penises. <START> We should all be so lucky. <STOP> <START> They do this thing called 'Playing Possum' where they appear dead and emit a death stink from their butt holes, fuck. <STOP> <START> I found one playing possum one time, thought it was dead and buried it. <STOP> <START> It dug itself out a few hours later and fucked a hen right in front of her chicks. <START> Wayne, think about the swear jar. <STOP> <START> You're putting so much money in. <STOP> <START> All right, let me take peek see? <STOP> <START> Pitterpatter. <STOP> <START> Always had a skilled hand in wrangling vermin. <STOP> <START> Thank you, Daryl. <STOP> <START> And that doesn't surprise me. <STOP> <START> No sweat. <STOP> <START> No sweat? <STOP> <START> In this heat? <STOP> <START> That is rich and it's funny. <STOP> <START> Honestly though, just take off your jumper. <STOP> <START> I'll hold it for you. <STOP> <START> You crawl up in there, no one gets dirty. <STOP> <START> Glen? <STOP> <START> Glen? <STOP> <START> Yes. <STOP> <START> Let's take about 20% off 'er up there, all right? <STOP> <START> Now, you wanna have an eye because he'll come out meaner and spit and go like a hot damn. <STOP> <START> Is he likely to bite? <STOP> <START> Is a duck's ass watertight? <STOP> <START> Get ready to give him the size nine's if he jukes by me. <STOP> <START> How be I give him the size twelve and a halfs instead? <STOP> <START> Oh, I see him. <STOP> <START> That's some drunk evolution right there, bud. <STOP> <START> You gotta wonder what two Christmade miscreants mated to make that. <STOP> <START> It's almost not worth thinkin' about. <STOP> <START> Do I just reach for him? <STOP> <START> That's a better idea than going in head first. <STOP> <START> Put him where? <STOP> <START> Under my boot. <STOP> <START> Boys, just do your best not to make too big a mess, all right? <STOP> <START> And I'm sorry again about all this heat. <START> Whoohoo! <STOP> <START> Oh, for fucksakes. <STOP> <START> Ow. <STOP> <START> You wish there was a Pied Piper for possums, but there isn't, so you're gonna have to just keep pickin' 'em off with the .22. <STOP> <START> Buckle up 'cause they're fuckin' ugly. <STOP> <START> Of course, that's not to say I have it all my damn self. <STOP> <START> Is that a herpe on your hand, Daryl? <STOP> <START> Did you pay a little extra to go all the way with a ripper in the back room again?. <STOP> <START> No, I don't think he'd make that mistake twice. <STOP> <START> Got a little trouser trauma? <START> Was she fun or was she fungal? <STOP> <START> Hey, guess what? <STOP> <START> A guy's girlfriend is having a hard time parking the car, right? <STOP> <START> He says, You should get tested. <STOP> <START> She says, <START> Well no, I'm not so bad at driving. <STOP> <START> He says, No, I have chlamydia. <STOP> <START> Is that a bite? <STOP> <START> The guy takes a hooker out for supper. <STOP> <START> He gave her his peas, she gave him herpes. <STOP> <START> Daryl, what happened? <STOP> <START> Did something bite you?. <STOP> <START> A possum. <STOP> <START> A possum?. <STOP> <START> That's right. <START> Well, he could have rabies. <STOP> <START> Boo fuckin' hoo. <STOP> <START> No, rabies is serious. <STOP> <START> It attacks the central nervous system. <STOP> <START> If he gets puke between the floor boards it ain't coming out. <START> Well, I can't take him to the clinic. <STOP> <START> I gotta do an ice run for the jamboree this week. <STOP> <START> Oh, Christ. <START> Well, Daryl, we're gonna have to take your van. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah? <START> Where's your nut sack boyfriend's today, Katy? <STOP> <START> They're at an away game against the Natives. <STOP> <START> Oh, I bet they're looking forward to playing those tough pricks. <STOP> <START> Christ. <STOP> <START> You sure you're ready to saddle up to the jamboree again? <STOP> <START> It was kind of you and Angie's thing. <STOP> <START> No sense sittin' on my hands. <STOP> <START> Time to find a new dance partner. <STOP> <START> All right, Daryl. <STOP> <START> Pitterpatter. <STOP> <START> Hey, why are crabs always so tired? <STOP> <START> It's 'cause they only sleep in snatches. <STOP> <START> Hey, wait a minute. <START> We're. <START> We're missing two schmelts. <START> Where are Deetzy and Burnsy? <STOP> <START> Oh, looks like a bad case of the Native flu, bro. <START> What's the Native flu? <STOP> <START> You're an idiot. <STOP> <START> The Natives are tough as hell. <STOP> <START> So another way to say someone is chickenshit to play them is to say they have the Native flu. <STOP> <START> Mix in a fuckin' clue, brotato chip. <STOP> <START> Keep those fucking bags up, schmelt. <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Bonnie, how are you now? <STOP> <START> Good and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> This isn't all for you, is it? <STOP> <START> It sure is. <STOP> <START> Is it for the jamboree? <STOP> <START> If we ever get it there. <STOP> <START> Save me a dance? <STOP> <START> Yup, sure. <STOP> <START> Thank you. <STOP> <START> I've always wanted to dance with you, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah? <START> We've all been watching you and Angie dance for so long thinking when's it gonna be our turns? <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah? <STOP> <START> But trust me, watching was enough. <STOP> <START> You used to move her body around like it didn't weigh a feather. <START> Well, you know, I think I got about a dozen baker's dozen here I guess we could just scan them and then I'll get out of your hair. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah, I'll scan them. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> It's broken. <STOP> <START> It'll be our little secret. <STOP> <START> Okay, sit down. <STOP> <START> Oh. <STOP> <START> Stewart?

<START> Wrong takeaway. <STOP> <START> You know, you're not a fuckin' idiot. <STOP> <START> You could turn it around if you wanted to. <STOP> <START> You know, I remember sneaking into your parties when I was 15, stealing your mixtapes. <STOP> <START> All your own music. <STOP> <START> I was really impressed. <STOP> <START> Guess those days are over, though. <STOP> <START> All right, Dairy, let's go. <STOP> <START> Dairy, come on. <STOP> <START> And yeah. <STOP> <START> You did use to charm me. <STOP> <START> McMurray, how're ya now? <STOP> <START> Not so bad, and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> I see you back to the jamboree, now. <STOP> <START> A few weeks off there. <STOP> <START> Oh, you noticed. <START> Well, it's hard not to notice all that Scottish tartan plaid you seem to enjoy so much. <STOP> <START> I wanted to talk about something important. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> My sister Bonnie is back from college, and she's a damn fine woman. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah. <STOP> <START> I just seen her down at the dollar store, there. <STOP> <START> You sure it was her? <STOP> <START> I mean, last time I seen her last she was in a kind of a DIY maxi dress, but she may have added a crochet pattern sweater on account of the breeze. <STOP> <START> Maybe autumn foliage or an Algonquin green? <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> I think she'd be a damn fine match for you, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> That's if you're ready. <STOP> <START> You know, 'cause of Angie and all. <STOP> <START> She's a lovely girl. <STOP> <START> No, you go ahead. <STOP> <START> That is if you. <STOP> <START> But you started, you mind finishing? <STOP> <START> Oh, it's just, was gonna say the space, looks, looks nice and clean without the. <STOP> <START> Yup. <STOP> <START> Run pretty good. <START> Well, all right. <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Hey, uh, I'll let you carry on. <STOP> <START> It's a good box of ice. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Yeah, good to see you. <STOP> <START> Have a good one. <STOP> <START> Hey, wait. <STOP> <START> You save her dance now, eh, big boy? <STOP> <START> Good enough, McMurray. <STOP> <START> Atta boy. <STOP> <START> Does that taste right? <STOP> <START> Ya, okay. <STOP> <START> Mmm. <STOP> <START> I think so, I don't know, I don't know. <STOP> <START> I've had an epiphany! <STOP> <START> Uh, can you taste this? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Never again. <STOP> <START> Okay, okay, okay, then, can you snort it? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> I've given up on the meth business. <STOP> <START> I'm going back to the turntables. <STOP> <START> Hmm? <STOP> <START> Back to the ones and twos. <STOP> <START> For what? <STOP> <START> To become a superstar DJ. <STOP> <START> Oh, okay, okay, uh. <STOP> <START> But first, can you. <STOP> <START> Let's just try. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> I need you guys to tell everyone you know that I am hosting a rave in Letterkenny, and I will be spinning under all of my aliases. <STOP> <START> How many aliases have you had? <STOP> <START> DJ Pimpy Longstockings, DJ Peter Blumpkin, DJ <START> White Power Nap, DJ <START> White Power Bottom. <STOP> <START> They'll all be there!. <STOP> <START> All of them. <STOP> <START> Mmmmmm, so you're quitting the meth business?

<START> Well, I think it's pretty obvious that I'm moving hay bales from here over to here. <STOP> <START> Although, that one's a straw bale. <START> Why? <START> Well, pick up your fuckin' phone. <STOP> <START> McMurray's been trying to reach you all day. <STOP> <START> McMurray. <STOP> <START> At least I was yesterday! <STOP> <START> How're ya now?

<STOP> <START> I don't know, what the fuck. <STOP> <START> And you greenlit that tomfuckery? <STOP> <START> Had to. <STOP> <START> Agricultural Hall is low on funds. <STOP> <START> Allday bookings is a big boost for us. <STOP> <START> So, I couldn't say no. <STOP> <START> Agricultural Halls are for Agricultural music. <STOP> <START> Not for fuckin' raves. <START> Well, that's no way to get your communication badge, boy scout. <STOP> <START> Dairy. <STOP> <START> DARYL ON. <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Clinic. <STOP> <START> Pick up. <STOP> <START> Not feel good. <START> Well, he's not gonna get his communication badge, either. <STOP> <START> Dairy. <START> What's the fuss?

<START> What's that? <STOP> <START> Nabbing that possum was kind of a thrill. <STOP> <START> I think I could start a pest removal business. <STOP> <START> Oh, Daryl, that's just silly. <STOP> <START> But 'cept do you wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I'm gonna help you. <STOP> <START> You know Stewart's having a rave at the Ag Hall? <STOP> <START> Agricultural Halls are for agricultural music. <STOP> <START> Not for fuckin' raves. <STOP> <START> That's what I said. <STOP> <START> So here's what we're gonna do and I'm gonna tell ya. <START> We're gonna wrangle as many of those critters as possible, and let 'em loose at Stewart's rave. <STOP> <START> How do we get the word out about the business? <STOP> <START> Oh, you'd have to put it on your fuckin' Facebook, likely. <STOP> <START> Over and out. <STOP> <START> Look at this bowl of fruit salad. <STOP> <START> You want a taste, Tanis? <STOP> <START> Ooh, better watch that bark there. <STOP> <START> Boy might get bit. <START> What's going on here? <STOP> <START> You're looking a handful short. <STOP> <START> Caught a bad case of the Native flu, or what? <STOP> <START> You're drunk. <STOP> <START> Mix in a water. <START> Well, it's either that or you're all tweaking down that meth town you come from. <START> What did you say? <STOP> <START> Everyone knows Letterkenny has gone to meth. <STOP> <START> You guys a bunch of fuckin' basics. <STOP> <START> At least we keep it clean. <START> We just sell cigarettes. <STOP> <START> Your town ain't nothing but a bunch of jackedup scab pickers. <STOP> <START> Yeah, we'll see what you're calling us after I bury a couple of bar down wristers. <STOP> <START> Halfclapper, top cheddar. <STOP> <START> Biscuits top titties, bar downskies. <STOP> <START> Always bar downskie. <STOP> <START> Pull out the guns. <STOP> <START> Safetys off. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' safety off, boys. <STOP> <START> A little threeononeskie? <STOP> <START> A little threeontwoskie? <STOP> <START> Hum a high hard one. <STOP> <START> Hit the red light district. <STOP> <START> You won't make it that far, slugger. <STOP> <START> You either, champ. <STOP> <START> Buckets off. <STOP> <START> Center ice. <STOP> <START> Puck drop. <STOP> <START> Shed 'em. <STOP> <START> Go me. <STOP> <START> A little fuck me, fuck you. <STOP> <START> Free nose jobs. <STOP> <START> Let's dance. <STOP> <START> Let's hit the dfloor. <STOP> <START> My balls dangle harder than you, boy. <STOP> <START> Like I thought, bad case of the Native flu. <STOP> <START> Devon, we're missing $2000. <STOP> <START> Really? <STOP> <START> It's a devastating blow to Menergy Spa, I know. <STOP> <START> Hey, I'll call Stewart. <STOP> <START> He'll fix everything. <STOP> <START> Hello? <STOP> <START> Stewart? <STOP> <START> Hey, Devon. <STOP> <START> Hey, we're missing 2k. <STOP> <START> Yeah, I took it for the rave. 2k? <STOP> <START> I don't think you understand. <STOP> <START> It's going to be a massive production. <STOP> <START> It's gonna be like an. <STOP> <START> Aurora Borealisthemed Salvador Dali drug orgy with shamans. <STOP> <START> But that's a lot of money. <STOP> <START> No time, I gotta go. <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Daryl. <STOP> <START> Gailor, how are ya now? <STOP> <START> I'm on a juice cleanse. <STOP> <START> Haven't had a drink in three days. <STOP> <START> Had close to 30 shits, though. <STOP> <START> So what's the fuss? <START> Well, timing's right for your new business. <STOP> <START> Saw it up on your fuckin' Facebook, there. <STOP> <START> Got a skunk sleeping underneath us, right now. <STOP> <START> Did you not know skunks are immune to bee stings? <STOP> <START> They even teach their babies how to raid beehives. <STOP> <START> And? <START> Well, they burrow up for the winter, and rip farts on each other to keep warm. <STOP> <START> No way. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah. <STOP> <START> They go to mate as soon as they leave their mom, so you know they're probably thinking about her during sex. <STOP> <START> That or their brothers and sisters which is even more inappropriate. <STOP> <START> Oh. <STOP> <START> There's one knocking. <STOP> <START> Make way. <START> Well, pitterpatter. <STOP> <START> Can you take this one, please? <STOP> <START> Here's the deal. <STOP> <START> Stewart's rave is eating up all our money, and the business is failing without his expertise. <START> We simply aren't making enough coin selling the Native's cigarettes. <START> We need the meth. <STOP> <START> Menergy Spa is never going to happen at this rate. <STOP> <START> I officially move to boycott Stewart's rave, take it off our fuckin' Facebooks and sabotage it. <STOP> <START> All in favor say, Aye!. <STOP> <START> Aye! <STOP> <START> It's unanimous. <STOP> <START> How are we going to do this? <START> We could put something on our Facebooks. <START> We could say the Ag Hall has asbestos. <STOP> <START> Yes, asbestos. <STOP> <START> Everyone hates asbestos. <STOP> <START> Asbestos is the answer. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Let's do that. <STOP> <START> Maybe you don't say asbestos anymore, though. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Hey, Katy, you look beautiful. <STOP> <START> You look better. <STOP> <START> Um. <STOP> <START> I've come to cordially invite you to my rave tonight. <STOP> <START> Stewart. <STOP> <START> Fuck, greasiest skid I ever seen. <STOP> <START> Criss Angel mindfreak lookingmotherfucker. <START> What are you thinking holding a rave at the Ag Hall? <STOP> <START> I'm thinking I'm doing the Agricultural Society a huge favor. <STOP> <START> You guys are going broke. <STOP> <START> Tits up or not, it's inappropriate. <START> Why not the Legion? <STOP> <START> Or even upstairs at the arena? <STOP> <START> Or the fuckin' youth center. <STOP> <START> Because they're too small, shirttucker. <STOP> <START> Be prepared, because once this blows up they'll probably ask me to do it quarterly. <STOP> <START> Biweekly! <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <START> We'll see if it blows up then. <STOP> <START> It'll probably be pretty tough to find me through the crowd. <STOP> <START> Stage security will be pretty tight but your name's on the guest list, and there's a backstage pass with your name on it. <STOP> <START> I'll do my best to make it down, Stewart. <STOP> <START> My ass. <STOP> <START> And just as a heads up, it is a rave, so there will probably be people on drugs. <STOP> <START> You know, MDMA. <START> What? <STOP> <START> There's gonna be MDMA at the Ag Hall? <STOP> <START> Yes, there will be MDMA at my rave at the Ag Hall. <STOP> <START> There will be MDMA, DMT, PCP, LSD, LED and probably UFC. <STOP> <START> But I am clean and sober. <STOP> <START> You are spare parts, aren't you, bud? <STOP> <START> I truly hope to see you there. <START> Watch your fuckin' hands, skid. <STOP> <START> Three, two. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' skids are turning Letterkenny into a gong show, buddy. <STOP> <START> Fucking gonger, buddy. <STOP> <START> I'm rattled about that meth chirp, brotein. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' Stewart, bro. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' Stewart, bro. <STOP> <START> There's fuckin' two in that pud, hey, boys? <STOP> <START> Put 'em away like a winter coat, boys. <START> What the fuck was that? <STOP> <START> That was garbage. <STOP> <START> That was fuckin' pedestrian. <STOP> <START> All this beaking is kiddie pool shit. <STOP> <START> Is that what you want? <STOP> <START> Riley, Jonesy? <STOP> <START> Huh? <STOP> <START> You want to get dropped off at the splash pad on the way home, eh? <STOP> <START> Get mom and dad to pick you up after you all swim? <STOP> <START> No running on the deck, ya fuckin' pheasants. <STOP> <START> Fuck! <STOP> <START> Bag skate. <STOP> <START> Tomorrow, 00 a. m. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' embarrassing!. <STOP> <START> Hey, give your balls a tug, you titfucker! <STOP> <START> Fuck! <STOP> <START> You never looked so good. <STOP> <START> You never felt so good. <STOP> <START> I'm so proud of you, man. <STOP> <START> Save me a dance, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> You look better. <START> Where's Stewart, buddy?

<STOP> <START> No one cares about your cat's farts. <STOP> <START> But look how cute they are. <STOP> <START> Not to be impolite, but you're the only one who thinks so. <STOP> <START> Everybody whose got a cat or a kid, is going to think their cat's or kid's farts are super special and unique. <STOP> <START> They're not. <STOP> <START> They are just a cat or a kid fart. <STOP> <START> In addition, you've been updating new farts from your cat almost hourly. <STOP> <START> Oh, that's because there's so many cute farts. <STOP> <START> Like I can't even keep up. . <STOP> <START> Katy! <START> What is this fucking gong show?

<STOP> <START> If you continue to misuse Fartbook, we'll have to suspend your membership. <STOP> <START> Fine. <STOP> <START> Fine. <STOP> <START> Fluff you then. <STOP> <START> I have millions. <STOP> <START> And I mean, millions of ways of hearing unlimited farts. <START> We're done here, Glen. <STOP> <START> Are we though? <STOP> <START> Are we? <STOP> <START> I think we should pump the brakes on Fartbook. <STOP> <START> That's a Texassize 104. <START> Why? <STOP> <START> It's kicking up too much dust. <START> We haven't even gotten into it and already folks are gettin' chapped asses. <START> Well, that's their problem. <STOP> <START> Not ours. <STOP> <START> This is our problem. <START> We started Fartbook so that good folks could share farts with other good folks. <STOP> <START> That's it. <STOP> <START> Not to creepin' farts, or spam farts. <STOP> <START> Although, if you eat spam, you'll get good farts. <STOP> <START> Farts should never come between the love of a man and a woman. <STOP> <START> It's not right. <STOP> <START> You don't get to 500 million farts without making a few sharts. <STOP> <START> Exactly. <STOP> <START> So, what are you saying? <STOP> <START> Fartbook dies today. <STOP> <START> Today, Fartbook is dead. <STOP> <START> Oh. <STOP> <START> You think so? <STOP> <START> I'm with the fellas on this one. <STOP> <START> It's not why we invented it. <STOP> <START> You invented it? <STOP> <START> Our idea. <START> We built the site. <STOP> <START> You know, you really don't need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this. <STOP> <START> If you were the inventors of Fartbook, you'd have invented Fartbook. <STOP> <START> Hold your horses there. <STOP> <START> Let's put this to a vote. <STOP> <START> Those for closing down Fartbook, raise your hands. <STOP> <START> Those against? <STOP> <START> But we own 30 percent. <STOP> <START> This isn't fair! <STOP> <START> If you want to sit on our backs and call yourselves tall, you have every right to do so. <STOP> <START> But don't think that we're gonna sit here and enjoy listening to you lie. <STOP> <START> You have a bit of our attention, you have the smallest bit of our attention. <START> When did we ask for your attention? <STOP> <START> The rest of our attention is back at the offices of Fartbook, where my friends and I are doing things that no one on this farm, especially and including you idiots, are intellectually, creatively, artistically, emotionally, or spiritually capable of doing. <STOP> <START> Have I adequately answered your condescending question? <START> What question?. <STOP> <START> Farts! <STOP> <START> You better lawyer up, asshole, because I'm not coming back for 30 percent, I'm coming back for everything. <STOP> <START> I. <STOP> <START> I don't know what happened just now. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> You know, I've been thinking about Fartbook. <START> What about it, bigshits?. <STOP> <START> I think maybe we pulled the cord too quick on that, you parachute. <STOP> <START> I miss it too, threepoint shoes. <STOP> <START> I was on there a lot. <STOP> <START> Too much, likely. <STOP> <START> I was always checking it. <STOP> <START> It was very addicting. <STOP> <START> Except, did you ever really stop to think about one thing, did you? <STOP> <START> Rippin' farts into your computer doesn't exactly spike the likelihood of having sex with girls. <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Not now. <STOP> <START> Need 20 minutes. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Just wanted to let you know that Glen stole our website. <STOP> <START> It's been live for more than 36 hours. <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Fuck it!. <STOP> <START> Oh! <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> Jesus! <STOP> <START> Fucking sort yourselves out. <STOP> <START> Cheese and rice. <STOP> <START> I can't remember the last time five men came in this church so aggressively. <STOP> <START> Or can I? <STOP> <START> You stole our idea. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> Are you referring to Christian Fart Mingle? <START> What's that? <STOP> <START> It's like Christian Mingle, but for farts. <START> We asked your help with our idea and you went behind our backs and stole'd it. <STOP> <START> I didn't. <STOP> <START> Excuse. <STOP> <START> Oh, my God. <STOP> <START> Those are some hairy allegations you are firing, at my face. <STOP> <START> All your allegations. <STOP> <START> All of them, completely fricken' false. <STOP> <START> Baseless. <STOP> <START> How? <STOP> <START> Stewart, I did not steal anything. <STOP> <START> Because the last time I checked, taking advantage of a growing trend was not stealing. <START> What trend? <STOP> <START> I'll tell you. <STOP> <START> But first, let's sing a hymn. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Fine. <STOP> <START> Look, y'all had a good idea, all right? <STOP> <START> You had a terrific idea. <STOP> <START> Congratulations. <STOP> <START> But did you actually think you were the only ones in the world to have it? <START> What are you talking about? <STOP> <START> I'm talking about Fart culture, Stewart. <STOP> <START> It's all the rage. <STOP> <START> It's everywhere. <STOP> <START> You know. <STOP> <START> Nothing. <STOP> <START> Glen will show you. <STOP> <START> Ever heard of Plenty of Farts? <STOP> <START> I've heard of Plenty of Fish. <STOP> <START> It's very much like that, except for farts. <STOP> <START> Here. <STOP> <START> Here's the one I like the best. <STOP> <START> It's called Fart Filter. <STOP> <START> And I like it because you can put different filters on all of your farts and it's fun. <STOP> <START> So, yeah, I'll just show you how it works. <STOP> <START> This one, no filter. <STOP> <START> Nothing. <START> Who cares? <STOP> <START> Not Glen, right? <STOP> <START> Vanilla. <STOP> <START> Pedestrian. <STOP> <START> I'm not interested. <STOP> <START> However, shove that baby through the Hudson filter. <START> What's she gonna sound like? <STOP> <START> Now there's a renovation. <STOP> <START> Now suck on your Sutro filter. <STOP> <START> Now boys, because I'm feeling generous, and we're in the Lord's house, I'm gonna play you the filter that I invented myself. <STOP> <START> I call it. <STOP> <START> Valencia. <START> Wow. <STOP> <START> There is a whole site devoted to glutenfree farts. <STOP> <START> The point is, it's out there, boys. <STOP> <START> It's happened. <STOP> <START> The idea lives in the world. <STOP> <START> Y'all are too slow. <STOP> <START> Slow on the uptake. <STOP> <START> Sad story. <STOP> <START> Boohoo. <STOP> <START> Toottoot! <STOP> <START> Go away. <STOP> <START> Let's go. <STOP> <START> Sad face, sad face, angry face. <STOP> <START> Better slow down there, Bigshoots. <STOP> <START> Tomorrow's gonna be a great day for hay. <STOP> <START> If you can be a man at night, you can be a man in the morning. <START> Wayne, how come you didn't join Fartbook? 'Cause you're not supposed to fart in front of girls. <START> What? <STOP> <START> There's certain things that should stay sacred between a man and a woman. <STOP> <START> So, all things considered, this whole thing's pretty fucking juvenile, if I do say so myself. <STOP> <START> If she's always listening to your ass acoustics, or even worse, smellin' 'em, I guarantee she'll be slower and slower to crawl into bed with you at night. <START> What you just said is outrageous. <STOP> <START> No it isn't. <STOP> <START> It's true. <STOP> <START> I don't wanna be smelling a dude's ass all the time. <STOP> <START> Get real. <START> What are you? <STOP> <START> Some kind of fart purist? <STOP> <START> So what are you supposed to do? <STOP> <START> Just hold it in? <STOP> <START> Or take a shit, you fuckin' degenerate. <STOP> <START> Speaking of shit, my second cousin's got IBS. <START> Who, Garrett? <STOP> <START> No, Jarett. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> IBS, the International Business Solution? <STOP> <START> IBS stands for Irritable Bowel Syndromes. <STOP> <START> Anyhoo, when he was a kid, Jackass comes out on the air, so it becomes real popular in his high school, for kids to start taking shits in places what weren't meant for taking shits in. <STOP> <START> They calls that guerrilla shittin'. <STOP> <START> Is this a true story?

<STOP> <START> Corect. <STOP> <START> Tenfour, good buddy. <START> Well, it's gonna be a busy week 'cause there's a few guys walking around town claiming to be the toughest guys in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> I'm the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> You were the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> It's been some time. <STOP> <START> Now, it's safe to assume that that title is as important to you now as it was then? <STOP> <START> Does a duck with a boner drag weeds? <STOP> <START> Tenfour, good buddy! <STOP> <START> Then it's safe to assume that the challengers will be coming up around the farm, as that is how you've conducted business in the past. <START> Well, I was never one for an audience. <STOP> <START> All right, let's talk about the challengers. <STOP> <START> First up, we've got Sled Ted. <START> Why's he called Sled Ted? <START> Well, he likes fixin' sleds, and ridin' sleds, and talkin' about sleds. <STOP> <START> He just really likes sleddin', boys. <STOP> <START> Uh, he beat up a guy named Basic Jay. <START> Why's he called Basic Jay? 'Cause he's a fuckin' basic. <STOP> <START> And now he thinks he's the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> After that, we got Rat Ass. <START> Why's he called Rat Ass? 'Cause he's got a hairy ass like a rat. <STOP> <START> Can confirm. <STOP> <START> He beat up a guy named Brains. <STOP> <START> See, his name's Brian but he spelt it Brain in the computer at bowling one time. <STOP> <START> It just kinda stuck. <STOP> <START> Now he thinks he's the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> And after that, we got Joint Boy. <STOP> <START> Because he smokes lots of joints, Dairy. <START> Well, just plucking the low hanging fruit is what that is. <STOP> <START> I've seen that guy take on four bouncers at the rippers one time. <STOP> <START> He is otherworldly. <STOP> <START> Got a dome on him like an Easter Island statue. <STOP> <START> Is he single? <STOP> <START> Not that it matters, I guess. <STOP> <START> Look, keep it at the end of the lane way. <STOP> <START> No degens on the property. <STOP> <START> That's a Texas size 104. <STOP> <START> Over and out. <START> Well, this is annoying. <STOP> <START> The fuck are they doin' out there? <STOP> <START> They're scared of you. <STOP> <START> This snipe is a fuckin' sniper. <STOP> <START> Snipe's a fuckin' beauty. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' look at this snipe. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' love this snipe. <START> We're snipe selling, boys. <STOP> <START> Dirty fucking dangles, boys. <STOP> <START> You're a sniper. <STOP> <START> You're a snipe. <STOP> <START> You're a skirt, you pansy. <STOP> <START> If you make me walk up the lane way again, we're having babies. <STOP> <START> Put it out! <STOP> <START> Put it out! <STOP> <START> Put it out! <STOP> <START> Fuck! <STOP> <START> Fuck! <STOP> <START> Those boys need to give their balls a tug. <STOP> <START> Maybe, check, make sure they're still attached right quick. <STOP> <START> I'd rather put a mirror down there and see what's what. <STOP> <START> One time, my cousin. <STOP> <START> He tore open his ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick and he had to show it to his mum. <START> Was it his scrotal sack? <START> Well, you know. <STOP> <START> That dangly piece of flesh, what hangs down behind the penis. <STOP> <START> Scrotal sack. <STOP> <START> The nut sack. <STOP> <START> So, he tore his ball sack open trying to do a skateboard trick and he's gots to show it to his mum because apparently one of his testicles was showing. <START> Was it the right one or the left one? <START> Why is that of importance? <START> Well, because the left one has more sperm in it. <STOP> <START> Spermatozoa is what it's called. <STOP> <START> Tell you what, if I ripped open my ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick, I'd be more worried about seeing my vas deferens. <START> Well, you'd have to tear your ball sack pretty near wide open doing a skateboard trick if you wanted to see your own vas deferens. <STOP> <START> I'm not sure I wanna see my own vas deferens I think if I saw my own vas deferens, I'd be quite worried. <STOP> <START> I'd be most worried if I tore my ball sack open trying to do a skateboard trick if I could see my accessory glands. <START> Well, you don't want to go too kooky with accessories on your truck. <STOP> <START> Or your jeep. <STOP> <START> It's okay with like, a quad, though, like my buddy Big T's got a snorkel kit on his and that's pretty punk rock. <START> What's an accessory gland? <START> Well, if your vas deferens is your sperm ducts, the accessory glands is what supplies lubricant to the sperm duct. <STOP> <START> I think if I ripped open my ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick, I'd be most worried about seeing my seminal vesicles. <STOP> <START> Oh, like the Florida State seminal vesicles? <STOP> <START> Like the sack that hangs behind your vas deferens and contains fructose which is energy for the sperm. <STOP> <START> Yeah, it's like when you go in the city there and they got them charge stations for the people that drive the electric cars. <STOP> <START> That's pretty much your seminal vesticles. <STOP> <START> I thought it was pretty funny when I said Florida State seminal vesicles and nobody laughed. <STOP> <START> Hello. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> End of the lane way. <STOP> <START> Don't come up the property. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> Sled Ted's here. <STOP> <START> Geez, Basic Jay must have been a shit fighter to lose to that asshat. <STOP> <START> I've known Basic Jay to be a pretty tough dude. <STOP> <START> He's not really a fuckin' basic. <STOP> <START> Guess he could have had a cold. <STOP> <START> Or the flu. <STOP> <START> Sled Ted had Bigfoot hands. <STOP> <START> Yeah, he's a big grimy brute. <STOP> <START> Shit fighter, though. <STOP> <START> Do you guys remember the fragrance Brut? <STOP> <START> Or Actif Brut? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Yeah, they still make that. <STOP> <START> I always enjoyed that fragrance. <STOP> <START> You can use it to dry up zits too. <STOP> <START> Did you know you can use shaving cream to get permanent marker off your hands? <START> Why wouldn't you just dip your hands in the parts cleaner? <START> Well, most people don't have a parts cleaner. <START> Well, most likely Rat Ass will be your next dude. <STOP> <START> I hear that he is a greaser. <STOP> <START> Can confirm. <STOP> <START> So fuckin' greasy I almost don't want to. <STOP> <START> I saw him with his shirt off, swimming at the gravel pit not that long ago. <STOP> <START> His back acne was extraordinary. <START> Well, like, extraordinary how? <START> Well, like, I thought about it for a while after is all. <START> Well, elaborate, 'cause I'm likely gonna have to touch it. <START> Well, like how it was cultivated. <START> Well, by not showering likely. <STOP> <START> Likely. <STOP> <START> Did you know that men can wear the fragrance CK ONE as well as women? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> That's 'cause it's an unisex fragrance. <STOP> <START> It says that right on the bottle. <STOP> <START> But would ya? <STOP> <START> Oh, negative. <STOP> <START> Me neither. <START> Would you wear Gap Dream?. <STOP> <START> No! <STOP> <START> No, no, Dairy, that's for girls. <STOP> <START> Dairy, that's for girls. <STOP> <START> You can't walk around smelling like pretty girls. <STOP> <START> You're not wearing it right now, are you? <STOP> <START> Cologne is too expensive. <STOP> <START> I just use sunscreen. <STOP> <START> Banana Boat. <STOP> <START> Let's get into some of those fuckin' all dressed chips. <STOP> <START> Jesus, Katy, put some fuckin' clothes on. <STOP> <START> Not my forte. <STOP> <START> Unfortunate. <STOP> <START> Hey, neighbor said he's not gonna give us a horse this year. <START> What? <START> Well, he said that last year we returned him and his breath smelled like alcohol. <START> Well, it was probably mine. <STOP> <START> You could have lit my breath on fire the next day. <STOP> <START> Horse was half cut though. <STOP> <START> He said that he's gonna give us a donkey. <STOP> <START> Nope. <STOP> <START> Might be funny. <STOP> <START> Gotta be a horse. <STOP> <START> You don't fuck with tradition. <STOP> <START> You're really gonna pump the brakes on a donkey dressed up like a unicorn? <STOP> <START> Oh, I'm stompin' the brakes. <STOP> <START> You put that idea right through the fuckin' windshield. <STOP> <START> But it's a donkey dressed up like a unicorn. <STOP> <START> Katy! <START> Well, it's better than a kick in the pants. <STOP> <START> Do you want this to be the softest birthday party ever or not? <STOP> <START> I want this just as much as you do. <START> Well, then find us a horse. <STOP> <START> Please and thank you. <STOP> <START> And don't stay out in the sun too long. <STOP> <START> Your skin will look like an old saddle bag. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Hello. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> End of the lane way. <STOP> <START> Don't come up the property. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> Rat Ass is here. <STOP> <START> Keep it standing. <STOP> <START> This goes to the ground, we stand up. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> This goes to a clinch, we separate. <STOP> <START> Great. <STOP> <START> Let's go! <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> So, hit me. <STOP> <START> Fight him or shut the fuck up. <STOP> <START> I'll give you a free one. <START> What the fuck is this?

<STOP> <START> Oh, not so bad. <STOP> <START> Ooh, look what you brought with you. <STOP> <START> Hello, Daryl. <STOP> <START> Oh, fuck. <STOP> <START> Fuck, you're naked as a jay bird. <START> Wayne, it's humid. <STOP> <START> It's the humidity. <STOP> <START> Y'all might want to think about doing the same thing, just pop your pants right off, that way no one gets sticky. <STOP> <START> Nope. <STOP> <START> It's not so bad. <START> What's the fuss? <STOP> <START> Ma O'Dell mentioned something about you helping her get a squirrel out of her attic. <STOP> <START> I'm faced with a similar conundrum. <STOP> <START> Right over there. <STOP> <START> It seems some kinda rodent's made his home over there. <STOP> <START> I have not seen him, but I sure can smell him. <STOP> <START> Hum. <STOP> <START> It's a possum. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> Possum. <STOP> <START> That's right. <STOP> <START> Oh, pitter patter, let's get at 'er. <STOP> <START> Do you wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I'd reach into a pirate hooker's chamber pot before I'd reach in there. <STOP> <START> And I'm going to tell ya. <STOP> <START> Possums are immune to snake venom. <STOP> <START> They could probably survive a nuclear blast. <STOP> <START> I think it's pronounced newcuelar. <STOP> <START> Mmm, but it isn't. <STOP> <START> They're mutants. <STOP> <START> They have forked fuckin' penises. <START> We should all be so lucky. <STOP> <START> They do this thing called 'Playing Possum' where they appear dead and emit a death stink from their butt holes, fuck. <STOP> <START> I found one playing possum one time, thought it was dead and buried it. <STOP> <START> It dug itself out a few hours later and fucked a hen right in front of her chicks. <START> Wayne, think about the swear jar. <STOP> <START> You're putting so much money in. <STOP> <START> All right, let me take peek see? <STOP> <START> Pitterpatter. <STOP> <START> Always had a skilled hand in wrangling vermin. <STOP> <START> Thank you, Daryl. <STOP> <START> And that doesn't surprise me. <STOP> <START> No sweat. <STOP> <START> No sweat?

<STOP> <START> Glen? <STOP> <START> Yes. <STOP> <START> Let's take about 20% off 'er up there, all right? <STOP> <START> Now, you wanna have an eye because he'll come out meaner and spit and go like a hot damn. <STOP> <START> Is he likely to bite? <STOP> <START> Is a duck's ass watertight? <STOP> <START> Get ready to give him the size nine's if he jukes by me. <STOP> <START> How be I give him the size twelve and a halfs instead? <STOP> <START> Oh, I see him. <STOP> <START> That's some drunk evolution right there, bud. <STOP> <START> You gotta wonder what two Christmade miscreants mated to make that. <STOP> <START> It's almost not worth thinkin' about. <STOP> <START> Do I just reach for him? <STOP> <START> That's a better idea than going in head first. <STOP> <START> Put him where? <STOP> <START> Under my boot. <STOP> <START> Boys, just do your best not to make too big a mess, all right? <STOP> <START> And I'm sorry again about all this heat. <START> Whoohoo! <STOP> <START> Oh, for fucksakes. <STOP> <START> Ow. <STOP> <START> You wish there was a Pied Piper for possums, but there isn't, so you're gonna have to just keep pickin' 'em off with the .22. <STOP> <START> Buckle up 'cause they're fuckin' ugly. <STOP> <START> Of course, that's not to say I have it all my damn self. <STOP> <START> Is that a herpe on your hand, Daryl? <STOP> <START> Did you pay a little extra to go all the way with a ripper in the back room again?. <STOP> <START> No, I don't think he'd make that mistake twice. <STOP> <START> Got a little trouser trauma? <START> Was she fun or was she fungal? <STOP> <START> Hey, guess what? <STOP> <START> A guy's girlfriend is having a hard time parking the car, right? <STOP> <START> He says, You should get tested. <STOP> <START> She says, <START> Well no, I'm not so bad at driving. <STOP> <START> He says, No, I have chlamydia. <STOP> <START> Is that a bite? <STOP> <START> The guy takes a hooker out for supper. <STOP> <START> He gave her his peas, she gave him herpes. <STOP> <START> Daryl, what happened? <STOP> <START> Did something bite you?. <STOP> <START> A possum. <STOP> <START> A possum?. <STOP> <START> That's right. <START> Well, he could have rabies. <STOP> <START> Boo fuckin' hoo. <STOP> <START> No, rabies is serious. <STOP> <START> It attacks the central nervous system. <STOP> <START> If he gets puke between the floor boards it ain't coming out. <START> Well, I can't take him to the clinic. <STOP> <START> I gotta do an ice run for the jamboree this week. <STOP> <START> Oh, Christ. <START> Well, Daryl, we're gonna have to take your van. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah? <START> Where's your nut sack boyfriend's today, Katy? <STOP> <START> They're at an away game against the Natives. <STOP> <START> Oh, I bet they're looking forward to playing those tough pricks. <STOP> <START> Christ. <STOP> <START> You sure you're ready to saddle up to the jamboree again? <STOP> <START> It was kind of you and Angie's thing. <STOP> <START> No sense sittin' on my hands. <STOP> <START> Time to find a new dance partner. <STOP> <START> All right, Daryl. <STOP> <START> Pitterpatter. <STOP> <START> Hey, why are crabs always so tired? <STOP> <START> It's 'cause they only sleep in snatches. <STOP> <START> Hey, wait a minute. <START> We're. <START> We're missing two schmelts. <START> Where are Deetzy and Burnsy? <STOP> <START> Oh, looks like a bad case of the Native flu, bro. <START> What's the Native flu? <STOP> <START> You're an idiot. <STOP> <START> The Natives are tough as hell. <STOP> <START> So another way to say someone is chickenshit to play them is to say they have the Native flu. <STOP> <START> Mix in a fuckin' clue, brotato chip. <STOP> <START> Keep those fucking bags up, schmelt. <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Bonnie, how are you now? <STOP> <START> Good and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> This isn't all for you, is it? <STOP> <START> It sure is. <STOP> <START> Is it for the jamboree? <STOP> <START> If we ever get it there. <STOP> <START> Save me a dance? <STOP> <START> Yup, sure. <STOP> <START> Thank you. <STOP> <START> I've always wanted to dance with you, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah? <START> We've all been watching you and Angie dance for so long thinking when's it gonna be our turns? <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah? <STOP> <START> But trust me, watching was enough. <STOP> <START> You used to move her body around like it didn't weigh a feather. <START> Well, you know, I think I got about a dozen baker's dozen here I guess we could just scan them and then I'll get out of your hair. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah, I'll scan them. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> It's broken. <STOP> <START> It'll be our little secret. <STOP> <START> Okay, sit down. <STOP> <START> Oh. <STOP> <START> Stewart?

<START> Wrong takeaway. <STOP> <START> You know, you're not a fuckin' idiot. <STOP> <START> You could turn it around if you wanted to. <STOP> <START> You know, I remember sneaking into your parties when I was 15, stealing your mixtapes. <STOP> <START> All your own music. <STOP> <START> I was really impressed. <STOP> <START> Guess those days are over, though. <STOP> <START> All right, Dairy, let's go. <STOP> <START> Dairy, come on. <STOP> <START> And yeah. <STOP> <START> You did use to charm me. <STOP> <START> McMurray, how're ya now? <STOP> <START> Not so bad, and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> I see you back to the jamboree, now. <STOP> <START> A few weeks off there. <STOP> <START> Oh, you noticed. <START> Well, it's hard not to notice all that Scottish tartan plaid you seem to enjoy so much. <STOP> <START> I wanted to talk about something important. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> My sister Bonnie is back from college, and she's a damn fine woman. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah. <STOP> <START> I just seen her down at the dollar store, there. <STOP> <START> You sure it was her? <STOP> <START> I mean, last time I seen her last she was in a kind of a DIY maxi dress, but she may have added a crochet pattern sweater on account of the breeze. <STOP> <START> Maybe autumn foliage or an Algonquin green? <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> I think she'd be a damn fine match for you, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> That's if you're ready. <STOP> <START> You know, 'cause of Angie and all. <STOP> <START> She's a lovely girl. <STOP> <START> No, you go ahead. <STOP> <START> That is if you. <STOP> <START> But you started, you mind finishing? <STOP> <START> Oh, it's just, was gonna say the space, looks, looks nice and clean without the. <STOP> <START> Yup. <STOP> <START> Run pretty good. <START> Well, all right. <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Hey, uh, I'll let you carry on. <STOP> <START> It's a good box of ice. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Yeah, good to see you. <STOP> <START> Have a good one. <STOP> <START> Hey, wait. <STOP> <START> You save her dance now, eh, big boy?

<STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Never again. <STOP> <START> Okay, okay, okay, then, can you snort it? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> I've given up on the meth business. <STOP> <START> I'm going back to the turntables. <STOP> <START> Hmm? <STOP> <START> Back to the ones and twos. <STOP> <START> For what? <STOP> <START> To become a superstar DJ. <STOP> <START> Oh, okay, okay, uh. <STOP> <START> But first, can you. <STOP> <START> Let's just try. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> I need you guys to tell everyone you know that I am hosting a rave in Letterkenny, and I will be spinning under all of my aliases. <STOP> <START> How many aliases have you had? <STOP> <START> DJ Pimpy Longstockings, DJ Peter Blumpkin, DJ <START> White Power Nap, DJ <START> White Power Bottom. <STOP> <START> They'll all be there!. <STOP> <START> All of them. <STOP> <START> Mmmmmm, so you're quitting the meth business?

<STOP> <START> I don't know, what the fuck. <STOP> <START> And you greenlit that tomfuckery? <STOP> <START> Had to. <STOP> <START> Agricultural Hall is low on funds. <STOP> <START> Allday bookings is a big boost for us. <STOP> <START> So, I couldn't say no. <STOP> <START> Agricultural Halls are for Agricultural music. <STOP> <START> Not for fuckin' raves. <START> Well, that's no way to get your communication badge, boy scout. <STOP> <START> Dairy. <STOP> <START> DARYL ON. <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Clinic. <STOP> <START> Pick up. <STOP> <START> Not feel good. <START> Well, he's not gonna get his communication badge, either. <STOP> <START> Dairy. <START> What's the fuss?

<STOP> <START> I'm gonna help you. <STOP> <START> You know Stewart's having a rave at the Ag Hall? <STOP> <START> Agricultural Halls are for agricultural music. <STOP> <START> Not for fuckin' raves. <STOP> <START> That's what I said. <STOP> <START> So here's what we're gonna do and I'm gonna tell ya. <START> We're gonna wrangle as many of those critters as possible, and let 'em loose at Stewart's rave. <STOP> <START> How do we get the word out about the business? <STOP> <START> Oh, you'd have to put it on your fuckin' Facebook, likely. <STOP> <START> Over and out. <STOP> <START> Look at this bowl of fruit salad. <STOP> <START> You want a taste, Tanis? <STOP> <START> Ooh, better watch that bark there. <STOP> <START> Boy might get bit. <START> What's going on here? <STOP> <START> You're looking a handful short. <STOP> <START> Caught a bad case of the Native flu, or what? <STOP> <START> You're drunk. <STOP> <START> Mix in a water. <START> Well, it's either that or you're all tweaking down that meth town you come from. <START> What did you say? <STOP> <START> Everyone knows Letterkenny has gone to meth. <STOP> <START> You guys a bunch of fuckin' basics. <STOP> <START> At least we keep it clean. <START> We just sell cigarettes. <STOP> <START> Your town ain't nothing but a bunch of jackedup scab pickers. <STOP> <START> Yeah, we'll see what you're calling us after I bury a couple of bar down wristers. <STOP> <START> Halfclapper, top cheddar. <STOP> <START> Biscuits top titties, bar downskies. <STOP> <START> Always bar downskie. <STOP> <START> Pull out the guns. <STOP> <START> Safetys off. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' safety off, boys. <STOP> <START> A little threeononeskie? <STOP> <START> A little threeontwoskie? <STOP> <START> Hum a high hard one. <STOP> <START> Hit the red light district. <STOP> <START> You won't make it that far, slugger. <STOP> <START> You either, champ. <STOP> <START> Buckets off. <STOP> <START> Center ice. <STOP> <START> Puck drop. <STOP> <START> Shed 'em. <STOP> <START> Go me. <STOP> <START> A little fuck me, fuck you. <STOP> <START> Free nose jobs. <STOP> <START> Let's dance. <STOP> <START> Let's hit the dfloor. <STOP> <START> My balls dangle harder than you, boy. <STOP> <START> Like I thought, bad case of the Native flu. <STOP> <START> Devon, we're missing $2000. <STOP> <START> Really? <STOP> <START> It's a devastating blow to Menergy Spa, I know. <STOP> <START> Hey, I'll call Stewart. <STOP> <START> He'll fix everything. <STOP> <START> Hello? <STOP> <START> Stewart? <STOP> <START> Hey, Devon. <STOP> <START> Hey, we're missing 2k. <STOP> <START> Yeah, I took it for the rave. 2k? <STOP> <START> I don't think you understand. <STOP> <START> It's going to be a massive production. <STOP> <START> It's gonna be like an. <STOP> <START> Aurora Borealisthemed Salvador Dali drug orgy with shamans. <STOP> <START> But that's a lot of money. <STOP> <START> No time, I gotta go. <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Daryl. <STOP> <START> Gailor, how are ya now? <STOP> <START> I'm on a juice cleanse. <STOP> <START> Haven't had a drink in three days. <STOP> <START> Had close to 30 shits, though. <STOP> <START> So what's the fuss? <START> Well, timing's right for your new business. <STOP> <START> Saw it up on your fuckin' Facebook, there. <STOP> <START> Got a skunk sleeping underneath us, right now. <STOP> <START> Did you not know skunks are immune to bee stings? <STOP> <START> They even teach their babies how to raid beehives. <STOP> <START> And? <START> Well, they burrow up for the winter, and rip farts on each other to keep warm. <STOP> <START> No way. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah. <STOP> <START> They go to mate as soon as they leave their mom, so you know they're probably thinking about her during sex. <STOP> <START> That or their brothers and sisters which is even more inappropriate. <STOP> <START> Oh. <STOP> <START> There's one knocking. <STOP> <START> Make way. <START> Well, pitterpatter. <STOP> <START> Can you take this one, please? <STOP> <START> Here's the deal. <STOP> <START> Stewart's rave is eating up all our money, and the business is failing without his expertise. <START> We simply aren't making enough coin selling the Native's cigarettes. <START> We need the meth. <STOP> <START> Menergy Spa is never going to happen at this rate. <STOP> <START> I officially move to boycott Stewart's rave, take it off our fuckin' Facebooks and sabotage it. <STOP> <START> All in favor say, Aye!. <STOP> <START> Aye! <STOP> <START> It's unanimous. <STOP> <START> How are we going to do this? <START> We could put something on our Facebooks. <START> We could say the Ag Hall has asbestos. <STOP> <START> Yes, asbestos. <STOP> <START> Everyone hates asbestos. <STOP> <START> Asbestos is the answer. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Let's do that. <STOP> <START> Maybe you don't say asbestos anymore, though. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Hey, Katy, you look beautiful. <STOP> <START> You look better. <STOP> <START> Um. <STOP> <START> I've come to cordially invite you to my rave tonight. <STOP> <START> Stewart. <STOP> <START> Fuck, greasiest skid I ever seen. <STOP> <START> Criss Angel mindfreak lookingmotherfucker. <START> What are you thinking holding a rave at the Ag Hall? <STOP> <START> I'm thinking I'm doing the Agricultural Society a huge favor. <STOP> <START> You guys are going broke. <STOP> <START> Tits up or not, it's inappropriate. <START> Why not the Legion? <STOP> <START> Or even upstairs at the arena? <STOP> <START> Or the fuckin' youth center. <STOP> <START> Because they're too small, shirttucker. <STOP> <START> Be prepared, because once this blows up they'll probably ask me to do it quarterly. <STOP> <START> Biweekly! <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <START> We'll see if it blows up then. <STOP> <START> It'll probably be pretty tough to find me through the crowd. <STOP> <START> Stage security will be pretty tight but your name's on the guest list, and there's a backstage pass with your name on it. <STOP> <START> I'll do my best to make it down, Stewart. <STOP> <START> My ass. <STOP> <START> And just as a heads up, it is a rave, so there will probably be people on drugs. <STOP> <START> You know, MDMA. <START> What? <STOP> <START> There's gonna be MDMA at the Ag Hall? <STOP> <START> Yes, there will be MDMA at my rave at the Ag Hall. <STOP> <START> There will be MDMA, DMT, PCP, LSD, LED and probably UFC. <STOP> <START> But I am clean and sober. <STOP> <START> You are spare parts, aren't you, bud? <STOP> <START> I truly hope to see you there. <START> Watch your fuckin' hands, skid. <STOP> <START> Three, two. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' skids are turning Letterkenny into a gong show, buddy. <STOP> <START> Fucking gonger, buddy. <STOP> <START> I'm rattled about that meth chirp, brotein. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' Stewart, bro. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' Stewart, bro. <STOP> <START> There's fuckin' two in that pud, hey, boys? <STOP> <START> Put 'em away like a winter coat, boys. <START> What the fuck was that? <STOP> <START> That was garbage. <STOP> <START> That was fuckin' pedestrian. <STOP> <START> All this beaking is kiddie pool shit. <STOP> <START> Is that what you want? <STOP> <START> Riley, Jonesy? <STOP> <START> Huh? <STOP> <START> You want to get dropped off at the splash pad on the way home, eh? <STOP> <START> Get mom and dad to pick you up after you all swim? <STOP> <START> No running on the deck, ya fuckin' pheasants. <STOP> <START> Fuck! <STOP> <START> Bag skate. <STOP> <START> Tomorrow, 00 a. m. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' embarrassing!. <STOP> <START> Hey, give your balls a tug, you titfucker! <STOP> <START> Fuck! <STOP> <START> You never looked so good. <STOP> <START> You never felt so good. <STOP> <START> I'm so proud of you, man. <STOP> <START> Save me a dance, <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> You look better. <START> Where's Stewart, buddy?

<STOP> <START> Uh, actually wait. <STOP> <START> I got to know. <STOP> <START> This has gotta sting a little bit, right?. <STOP> <START> I mean, you're short, you're ugly, you're incompetent, you're fuckin' broke! <STOP> <START> Fuckin' A. <STOP> <START> You're a fuckin' addict, you're hopeless. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> I mean you are such a tragedy that even all these people here who hate you, will bail you out, just so they can. <START> What's the word? <STOP> <START> Erase you. <STOP> <START> My cousin was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and he works at a fuckin' bank. <START> What's your fucking excuse? <STOP> <START> That'll do, Tanis. <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> I'm not talking to you. <STOP> <START> Look at you. <STOP> <START> You got bloodshot eyes, runny nose, fuckin' greasy hair, scabs everywhere. <START> What is that?

<STOP> <START> I'll tell you what's gotta sting a little bit. <START> Well, fuckin' get after it, then!. <START> Well, <START> Who would've 'thunk it. <STOP> <START> Fuck. <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <STOP> <START> That was a top tier sucker, Riley. <STOP> <START> You too, Jonesy. <STOP> <START> Thanks boys. <STOP> <START> I'd sucker you guys in your sleep. <STOP> <START> Still. <STOP> <START> Makes my top three suckers, boys. <STOP> <START> An A1 box shot, you fuckin' barbarian. <STOP> <START> Never claimed to be a lady. <STOP> <START> Did you stop and smoke a joint for a bit and then jump right back in there? <STOP> <START> Nectar of gods, fellas. <STOP> <START> On the house. <STOP> <START> All right!. <START> Well at this rate, we'll need another one soon, Gail. <STOP> <START> You know, I gotta say, I'm looking forward to a bit of peace and quiet around here. <STOP> <START> Hear, hear. <STOP> <START> There ain't no reason to get excited, am I right? <STOP> <START> Yup. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> All right. <START> Who the fuck is the toughest guy in here? <STOP> <START> That'd be me. <STOP> <START> You're discussing critical space stuff with your pals the other day. <STOP> <START> How would you batch in space? <START> With immaculate care. <STOP> <START> Yeah, it'd go airborne if you didn't contain it. <STOP> <START> Depends on the length of the missions, I thinks. <STOP> <START> Like, if it's a pretty short mission, you can probably gets away without mixing a batch up theres. <STOP> <START> Maybe you can get away without mixing a batch. <STOP> <START> I mix one every night or I'm not sleeping. <STOP> <START> Kind of likes how I needs to takes a shower immediately afters I takes a shits? <STOP> <START> You'd cone it. <START> What? <STOP> <START> Each spaceman's given a cone, put over your junk, for when you batch in space. <STOP> <START> They do? <STOP> <START> So let's say you're in your space quarters, you lay on your back in your bunk, put the cone over your junk and fire one up, and since it's zero gravity, your batch'd float up to the top of the cone, and remain there. <STOP> <START> Then what'll you do with it? <STOP> <START> Each cadet's got a space disposal in their quarters, so he'll just throw it in there. <STOP> <START> That what they do? <STOP> <START> Most important thing is to obstruct the space cam in your quarters so that the rest of the space cadets don't see you batching. <STOP> <START> I'd imagine they'd give you a few cones. <STOP> <START> Probably stick one of those cones over the camera. <STOP> <START> Exactly. <START> Wayne? <STOP> <START> Dan. <STOP> <START> How did youse acquires this knowledge? <STOP> <START> You remember when I took Angie down Disney? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <START> Was having drinks in a bar by Cape Canaveral and heard some cadets talking. <STOP> <START> Space cadets? <STOP> <START> Don't fuckin' piss me off, Dary. <STOP> <START> Isn't Cape Canaverals a ways away from Disney? <STOP> <START> It's not that far. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> You're having a drinks in Capes Canaverals and you overhear some cadets talk something about mixing a batch ups in space? <STOP> <START> Did I stutter? <STOP> <START> Crazier things have happened, I guess. <START> Was Bondars there? <STOP> <START> Roberta? <STOP> <START> Yeah, Robertas Bondars, neuroscientist, Canada's first female astronauts. <STOP> <START> Fucking legend, Robertas Bondars. <STOP> <START> Yeah, Bondar was there. <STOP> <START> Nice. <START> What about the other guy, um, what's his name? <STOP> <START> He just left, apparently. <START> Wow, rubbing shoulders with North America's finest space cadets. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Bondar hammered? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No, I seen her crash a few Old Fashioneds, but she was actually sitting in a quiet corner by herself. <START> Wonder why the other guys left. <STOP> <START> I don't have that information, Dan. <STOP> <START> Can you imagine if North America's finest space cadets went ups into outer space togethers? <STOP> <START> Oh, they did. <STOP> <START> They dids? <STOP> <START> Yup. <STOP> <START> Houston wanted them to go up there together again, too. <STOP> <START> Bondar didn't wanna. <START> Why nots? <STOP> <START> I don't think you wanna know. <START> Well, sures, we dos. <STOP> <START> Look, youse didn't hear this from me, all right? <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> Dary, all right? <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> Look, a lot of people don't know this, but those two weren't just North America's finest spacemen, they were actually planet Earth's finest space people. <STOP> <START> So, of course, Houston wanted them up there together as much as possible. <STOP> <START> But they only went up theres togethers the one time? <STOP> <START> Yep. 'Cause Bondars didn't wants to go up theres with him agains. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> So, like, he was as a bit of a guy's guy around Kennedy Center. <STOP> <START> You know, he played pranks and stuff, and they'd just say, <START> Well, that's just him. <STOP> <START> Of course, Bondar was the more senior spaceman, had a bit of a reputation for, like, kicking it oldschool. <STOP> <START> Hence, the Old Fashioneds. <STOP> <START> So she didn't have a lot of time for the whole boyswillbeboys mentality. 'Kay. <STOP> <START> So, they finally shoehorned them up there together, knowin' full well it was oil and water. <STOP> <START> And I guess you can say he proved them right. <STOP> <START> Those space cadets really tell tales out of school, eh? <STOP> <START> Yep. <START> What happened next? <STOP> <START> So, each spaceman's got a space cam in their quarters which are connected to the other spacemen's quarters, as well as the main shuttle bay and the saucer section, the two smaller bays and the stardrive section. <STOP> <START> They'd be connected to the main bridge? <STOP> <START> Of course, they are, Dary. <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> So, we're talking about an elite vessel here? <STOP> <START> NASA'd never send a ship up there if it wasn't galaxy class. <STOP> <START> You bet they wouldn't. <STOP> <START> Same with Elon Musk, but apparently Russia does it all the time. <STOP> <START> Fucking joke star fleet. <STOP> <START> So, what happened next? <STOP> <START> So, Bondar'd be up in Alpha quadrant, keeping the Captain's log, likely, of the events. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And they'd all just come out of a Yeager loop, so she was a bit worn out. <STOP> <START> Yeah, she wouldn't be at full bars. <STOP> <START> But, of course, there's Bondar still up there in Alpha, keeping an eye out for wormholes and what not. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> I guess there he'd be down there in Beta quadrant, floating around in space quarters, which Bondar could see, so could Houston. <STOP> <START> I guess what he'd do is float offcamera, pull his space pants down, grab his junk in a bunch in his hands. <STOP> <START> Like dinkerball? <STOP> <START> Sake, Dary. <STOP> <START> This is hard enough to get through without you stopping all over his story, Dary. <STOP> <START> Sorry, good buddy. <STOP> <START> So, there he'd be floating off camera. <STOP> <START> I guess what he'd do. <STOP> <START> Allegedlys. .according to the cadets, is dip just his junk back into frame. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Apparently did it all the time. <START> Where's Houston in all this? <STOP> <START> Houston thought it was hilarious. <STOP> <START> But Bondar didn't? <STOP> <START> Nope. <STOP> <START> Bondar did not. <STOP> <START> Jesus Christ. <STOP> <START> I guess then what he'd do is he'd get on his comms. <STOP> <START> Allegedlys. <STOP> <START> Just telling you what the cadets told me. <STOP> <START> He'd go like, Hey, Bondar, check out space cam six. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Yep. <STOP> <START> She report him? <STOP> <START> Oh, she reported it. <STOP> <START> Did they slap sanctions on him? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Yeah, he got jacked up. <STOP> <START> Good for Houstons. <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <STOP> <START> Of course, they were still supposed to be up there another two months together, and things only got worse. <STOP> <START> How? <STOP> <START> Remember what I was saying about the cone? <STOP> <START> Yeah? <STOP> <START> I guess whenever it was Bondar's turn to clean Beta quadrant, he would routinely batch and not cone it. <STOP> <START> Inexcusables! <STOP> <START> I ain't Bondar to tell you that's an understatement. <STOP> <START> I think she would, too. <STOP> <START> No, she never expected to be floating around some spaceman's quarters trying to catch airborne ejaculate in a plastic vacuum bag when she signed up for space camp. <STOP> <START> No, they only tell you about omega particles at space camp. <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <STOP> <START> This went on for two more months? <STOP> <START> Oh, no way, Dan. <STOP> <START> Oh, you better believe Houston aborted the mission. <STOP> <START> Bondar had strict orders to Picard Maneuver and warp 10 home. <STOP> <START> How many light years away were they? <STOP> <START> I was gonna ask, but then the cadets would know I was eavesdropping, so. <STOP> <START> Then what happened? <STOP> <START> They bring Bondar in for topsecret meeting, airtight boardroom, patdown, spawn entry, no cell phones inside and they said, <START> Well, what do you wanna do here, Bondar? <STOP> <START> Lets him have it. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> You remember how I said she's oldschool. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Bondar says to him, she says, I'm gonna be down at the bar drinking Old Fashioneds. <STOP> <START> That guy's gonna get what's coming to him. <STOP> <START> Fucking buzzed herself out of the boardroom. <STOP> <START> Dids he? <START> Well, Dan, one of them's up in space doing space activities, the other one's at a bar by Disney drinking Old Fashioneds. <STOP> <START> That woman is the portrait of class. <STOP> <START> She always has been. <STOP> <START> God bless yas, Robertas Bondars. <STOP> <START> Now, you can't be especially sure those were even real space cadets at the bar by Kennedy that day on account of being so close to Disney. <STOP> <START> Could have just been playing pretend or cosplaying, like so many in that area like to do. <STOP> <START> But if there weren't over there spinning the yarn, fucking Bondar for Prime Minister, eh? <STOP> <START> Allo. <STOP> <START> Oui, hello. <STOP> <START> Do it. <STOP> <START> Bae, no. <STOP> <START> Oh, come on, we talked about this. <STOP> <START> I told you MariePierre had to see it, and now, she's here. <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> Youse are sure you're laughing with me and not at me, eh? <STOP> <START> Absolutely not. <STOP> <START> Good enough. <STOP> <START> Is Katy there? <STOP> <START> Sup? <STOP> <START> Sup? <STOP> <START> Can you hold the camera for us? <STOP> <START> Sure. <STOP> <START> Oh, 'cause he's gonna do that thing for that second verse, right? <STOP> <START> Yup, the thing for the second verse is why we're here, lady. <STOP> <START> Gotcha. <STOP> <START> Ah, youse the luckiest. <STOP> <START> Caught me halfcaught here, fuck. <STOP> <START> All right, here goes. <STOP> <START> Oh! <STOP> <START> Bye!. <STOP> <START> Things we do for love, eh, big brother?

<STOP> <START> I'd have a beer. <STOP> <START> Atta boy. <START> What's the matter, Dary? <STOP> <START> I just. <STOP> <START> I haven't talked to Anik in a bit. <STOP> <START> I haven't seen Aniks in a fortnight. <STOP> <START> A fortnight?

<STOP> <START> It's better with an even number. <STOP> <START> You're discussing critical space stuff with your pals the other day. <STOP> <START> How would you batch in space? <START> With immaculate care. <STOP> <START> Yeah, it'd go airborne if you didn't contain it. <STOP> <START> Depends on the length of the missions, I thinks. <STOP> <START> Like, if it's a pretty short mission, you can probably gets away without mixing a batch up theres. <STOP> <START> Maybe you can get away without mixing a batch. <STOP> <START> I mix one every night or I'm not sleeping. <STOP> <START> Kind of likes how I needs to takes a shower immediately afters I takes a shits? <STOP> <START> You'd cone it. <START> What? <STOP> <START> Each spaceman's given a cone, put over your junk, for when you batch in space. <STOP> <START> They do? <STOP> <START> So let's say you're in your space quarters, you lay on your back in your bunk, put the cone over your junk and fire one up, and since it's zero gravity, your batch'd float up to the top of the cone, and remain there. <STOP> <START> Then what'll you do with it? <STOP> <START> Each cadet's got a space disposal in their quarters, so he'll just throw it in there. <STOP> <START> That what they do? <STOP> <START> Most important thing is to obstruct the space cam in your quarters so that the rest of the space cadets don't see you batching. <STOP> <START> I'd imagine they'd give you a few cones. <STOP> <START> Probably stick one of those cones over the camera. <STOP> <START> Exactly. <START> Wayne? <STOP> <START> Dan. <STOP> <START> How did youse acquires this knowledge? <STOP> <START> You remember when I took Angie down Disney? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <START> Was having drinks in a bar by Cape Canaveral and heard some cadets talking. <STOP> <START> Space cadets? <STOP> <START> Don't fuckin' piss me off, Dary. <STOP> <START> Isn't Cape Canaverals a ways away from Disney? <STOP> <START> It's not that far. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> You're having a drinks in Capes Canaverals and you overhear some cadets talk something about mixing a batch ups in space? <STOP> <START> Did I stutter? <STOP> <START> Crazier things have happened, I guess. <START> Was Bondars there? <STOP> <START> Roberta? <STOP> <START> Yeah, Robertas Bondars, neuroscientist, Canada's first female astronauts. <STOP> <START> Fucking legend, Robertas Bondars. <STOP> <START> Yeah, Bondar was there. <STOP> <START> Nice. <START> What about the other guy, um, what's his name? <STOP> <START> He just left, apparently. <START> Wow, rubbing shoulders with North America's finest space cadets. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Bondar hammered? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No, I seen her crash a few Old Fashioneds, but she was actually sitting in a quiet corner by herself. <START> Wonder why the other guys left. <STOP> <START> I don't have that information, Dan. <STOP> <START> Can you imagine if North America's finest space cadets went ups into outer space togethers? <STOP> <START> Oh, they did. <STOP> <START> They dids? <STOP> <START> Yup. <STOP> <START> Houston wanted them to go up there together again, too. <STOP> <START> Bondar didn't wanna. <START> Why nots? <STOP> <START> I don't think you wanna know. <START> Well, sures, we dos. <STOP> <START> Look, youse didn't hear this from me, all right? <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> Dary, all right? <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> Look, a lot of people don't know this, but those two weren't just North America's finest spacemen, they were actually planet Earth's finest space people. <STOP> <START> So, of course, Houston wanted them up there together as much as possible. <STOP> <START> But they only went up theres togethers the one time? <STOP> <START> Yep. 'Cause Bondars didn't wants to go up theres with him agains. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> So, like, he was as a bit of a guy's guy around Kennedy Center. <STOP> <START> You know, he played pranks and stuff, and they'd just say, <START> Well, that's just him. <STOP> <START> Of course, Bondar was the more senior spaceman, had a bit of a reputation for, like, kicking it oldschool. <STOP> <START> Hence, the Old Fashioneds. <STOP> <START> So she didn't have a lot of time for the whole boyswillbeboys mentality. 'Kay. <STOP> <START> So, they finally shoehorned them up there together, knowin' full well it was oil and water. <STOP> <START> And I guess you can say he proved them right. <STOP> <START> Those space cadets really tell tales out of school, eh? <STOP> <START> Yep. <START> What happened next? <STOP> <START> So, each spaceman's got a space cam in their quarters which are connected to the other spacemen's quarters, as well as the main shuttle bay and the saucer section, the two smaller bays and the stardrive section. <STOP> <START> They'd be connected to the main bridge? <STOP> <START> Of course, they are, Dary. <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> So, we're talking about an elite vessel here? <STOP> <START> NASA'd never send a ship up there if it wasn't galaxy class. <STOP> <START> You bet they wouldn't. <STOP> <START> Same with Elon Musk, but apparently Russia does it all the time. <STOP> <START> Fucking joke star fleet. <STOP> <START> So, what happened next? <STOP> <START> So, Bondar'd be up in Alpha quadrant, keeping the Captain's log, likely, of the events. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And they'd all just come out of a Yeager loop, so she was a bit worn out. <STOP> <START> Yeah, she wouldn't be at full bars. <STOP> <START> But, of course, there's Bondar still up there in Alpha, keeping an eye out for wormholes and what not. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> I guess there he'd be down there in Beta quadrant, floating around in space quarters, which Bondar could see, so could Houston. <STOP> <START> I guess what he'd do is float offcamera, pull his space pants down, grab his junk in a bunch in his hands. <STOP> <START> Like dinkerball? <STOP> <START> Sake, Dary. <STOP> <START> This is hard enough to get through without you stopping all over his story, Dary. <STOP> <START> Sorry, good buddy. <STOP> <START> So, there he'd be floating off camera. <STOP> <START> I guess what he'd do. <STOP> <START> Allegedlys. .according to the cadets, is dip just his junk back into frame. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Apparently did it all the time. <START> Where's Houston in all this? <STOP> <START> Houston thought it was hilarious. <STOP> <START> But Bondar didn't? <STOP> <START> Nope. <STOP> <START> Bondar did not. <STOP> <START> Jesus Christ. <STOP> <START> I guess then what he'd do is he'd get on his comms. <STOP> <START> Allegedlys. <STOP> <START> Just telling you what the cadets told me. <STOP> <START> He'd go like, Hey, Bondar, check out space cam six. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Yep. <STOP> <START> She report him? <STOP> <START> Oh, she reported it. <STOP> <START> Did they slap sanctions on him? <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Yeah, he got jacked up. <STOP> <START> Good for Houstons. <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <STOP> <START> Of course, they were still supposed to be up there another two months together, and things only got worse. <STOP> <START> How? <STOP> <START> Remember what I was saying about the cone? <STOP> <START> Yeah? <STOP> <START> I guess whenever it was Bondar's turn to clean Beta quadrant, he would routinely batch and not cone it. <STOP> <START> Inexcusables! <STOP> <START> I ain't Bondar to tell you that's an understatement. <STOP> <START> I think she would, too. <STOP> <START> No, she never expected to be floating around some spaceman's quarters trying to catch airborne ejaculate in a plastic vacuum bag when she signed up for space camp. <STOP> <START> No, they only tell you about omega particles at space camp. <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <STOP> <START> This went on for two more months? <STOP> <START> Oh, no way, Dan. <STOP> <START> Oh, you better believe Houston aborted the mission. <STOP> <START> Bondar had strict orders to Picard Maneuver and warp 10 home. <STOP> <START> How many light years away were they? <STOP> <START> I was gonna ask, but then the cadets would know I was eavesdropping, so. <STOP> <START> Then what happened? <STOP> <START> They bring Bondar in for topsecret meeting, airtight boardroom, patdown, spawn entry, no cell phones inside and they said, <START> Well, what do you wanna do here, Bondar? <STOP> <START> Lets him have it. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> You remember how I said she's oldschool. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Bondar says to him, she says, I'm gonna be down at the bar drinking Old Fashioneds. <STOP> <START> That guy's gonna get what's coming to him. <STOP> <START> Fucking buzzed herself out of the boardroom. <STOP> <START> Dids he? <START> Well, Dan, one of them's up in space doing space activities, the other one's at a bar by Disney drinking Old Fashioneds. <STOP> <START> That woman is the portrait of class. <STOP> <START> She always has been. <STOP> <START> God bless yas, Robertas Bondars. <STOP> <START> Now, you can't be especially sure those were even real space cadets at the bar by Kennedy that day on account of being so close to Disney. <STOP> <START> Could have just been playing pretend or cosplaying, like so many in that area like to do. <STOP> <START> But if there weren't over there spinning the yarn, fucking Bondar for Prime Minister, eh? <STOP> <START> Allo. <STOP> <START> Oui, hello. <STOP> <START> Do it. <STOP> <START> Bae, no. <STOP> <START> Oh, come on, we talked about this. <STOP> <START> I told you MariePierre had to see it, and now, she's here. <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> Youse are sure you're laughing with me and not at me, eh? <STOP> <START> Absolutely not. <STOP> <START> Good enough. <STOP> <START> Is Katy there? <STOP> <START> Sup? <STOP> <START> Sup? <STOP> <START> Can you hold the camera for us? <STOP> <START> Sure. <STOP> <START> Oh, 'cause he's gonna do that thing for that second verse, right? <STOP> <START> Yup, the thing for the second verse is why we're here, lady. <STOP> <START> Gotcha. <STOP> <START> Ah, youse the luckiest. <STOP> <START> Caught me halfcaught here, fuck. <STOP> <START> All right, here goes. <STOP> <START> Oh! <STOP> <START> Bye!. <STOP> <START> Things we do for love, eh, big brother?

<STOP> <START> Rocked one, yeah. <STOP> <START> You can say it. <STOP> <START> Just don't make a habit of it. <STOP> <START> Texassized 104. <STOP> <START> The dude was at the airport with his iPad on top of the urinal and he was working on it while he rocked one? <STOP> <START> Can confirm. <START> What could be so urgent? <STOP> <START> That's what I said. <STOP> <START> I said, <START> What could be so urgent? <STOP> <START> Then I said, Like, who is this nut sac? <STOP> <START> Or who does this nut sac think he is? <STOP> <START> Here's the thing that I'm going to tell you. <STOP> <START> Now, I've really come land, sea, and air at this. 'Kay. .over time. <STOP> <START> There's only thing that could be so urgent. <STOP> <START> Checkin' in for his flight? <STOP> <START> Hard no. <STOP> <START> Uh, a lot of airlines overbook their flights anticipating noshows. <STOP> <START> And if you don't check in you're hooped. <STOP> <START> But still, to be at the airport, at the urinal, on your iPad, with your. <STOP> <START> Dick out? <STOP> <START> Your horn, yeah. <STOP> <START> Dick. <START> Won't make a habit of it. <STOP> <START> To be at the airport, at the urinal, on your iPad, with your dick out, there's got to be more at stake than a missed flight. <STOP> <START> Have you ever missed a flight? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Me neither. 'Kay. <STOP> <START> Bet it sucks, though. <STOP> <START> Still, airport, iPad, urinal, dick out. <STOP> <START> Like let's get real here. <STOP> <START> You get real. <STOP> <START> You get real. <STOP> <START> The dude's important. <STOP> <START> Or he's got someone really important to answer to, if his iPad work couldn't wait till after he rocked one. <STOP> <START> Big time. <START> What's he putting into the iPad is what I want to know. <STOP> <START> L'il help? <STOP> <START> L'il help. <START> Wanna know what he's puttin' in the iPad? <STOP> <START> I can tell you what he's putting in the iPad. <STOP> <START> Here's what he's putting into the iPad. <STOP> <START> The codes. <STOP> <START> The codes? <STOP> <START> Those codes. <STOP> <START> That's a thing that could be so urgent. <STOP> <START> That's the one thing that could be so urgent. <START> What a goof. <STOP> <START> To be at the airport at the urinal, with your iPad, your dick out. <STOP> <START> Silly. <STOP> <START> This nut sac is one in a chain of commanding political figures with access to the codes to green light a nuclear strike. <STOP> <START> That's who he is. <STOP> <START> And he had to get his portion of the codes in immediately, so that the warheads could take flight. <START> Why's he firing a warhead? <START> Well, someone would have had to fire a warhead first, right? <STOP> <START> You know, if I'm that dude at the airport, with my dick out, working on my iPad, I mean, the whole fuckin' world's at stake. <STOP> <START> There's multiple warheads? <STOP> <START> Both sides would have to have warheads in the air or projectiles, if it's nuclear war, yes. <STOP> <START> Those are some stakes. <START> What else could be so urgent? <STOP> <START> Not much else could be so urgent. <STOP> <START> So the other three in the political chain of command had already entered their portion of the codes and they just needed, we'll call him Gary, to enter his portion of the codes. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <START> What? <START> Wonder how Gary's working it? <START> What are we talking about here, the iPad or the. <STOP> <START> Or. <STOP> <START> Both. <STOP> <START> Both? <STOP> <START> Curious as to whether he had one hand on his horn and one on the iPad. <STOP> <START> Because if he's pissing handsfree, then he'd get the codes typed in much faster. <STOP> <START> Oh, way faster. <STOP> <START> At least twice as fast. <STOP> <START> Yeah, and he's in a hurry for sure, 'cause of the codes. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> JeanClaude. <STOP> <START> JeanLance. <STOP> <START> JeanClaude. <STOP> <START> JeanLance. <STOP> <START> Go sit down and drink your beer. <START> What if I don't?

<STOP> <START> Let's leave the halfblood prince to his little sleeps. <STOP> <START> Good nap? <STOP> <START> Great nap. <STOP> <START> Nap with me? <START> Well, I just kind of had a nap. <STOP> <START> Then we don't need to sleep. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Sure we can't convince you guys to sign with the summer squad?

<STOP> <START> It'd be one of the other three. <STOP> <START> I think you're right. <STOP> <START> I'm for sure right. <STOP> <START> The other three wouldn't likely trust Gary's secretary with news of incoming projectiles. <STOP> <START> MarieFred, you don't trust the fuckin' secretary with the projectiles. <STOP> <START> The secretary wouldn't have been sworn in like the other government officials. <START> Who knows who the secretary's working for? <STOP> <START> Secretary could be workin' for anybody. <STOP> <START> There'd be protocol in place. <STOP> <START> It would be in writing. <STOP> <START> That information would be so classified. <STOP> <START> You know how classified that information would be?

<START> What? <STOP> <START> The washroom had to have been right there. <STOP> <START> It had to have been right there. <STOP> <START> He might already have been in the washroom. <STOP> <START> I think he was already in there. <STOP> <START> You're Gary, you're in the washroom, you get the call, need the codes. <STOP> <START> I'm gonna piss myself. <STOP> <START> And he got his iPad out as fast as he got his dick out?

<STOP> <START> Rocked one, yeah. <STOP> <START> You can say it. <STOP> <START> Just don't make a habit of it. <STOP> <START> Texassized 104. <STOP> <START> The dude was at the airport with his iPad on top of the urinal and he was working on it while he rocked one? <STOP> <START> Can confirm. <START> What could be so urgent? <STOP> <START> That's what I said. <STOP> <START> I said, <START> What could be so urgent? <STOP> <START> Then I said, Like, who is this nut sac? <STOP> <START> Or who does this nut sac think he is? <STOP> <START> Here's the thing that I'm going to tell you. <STOP> <START> Now, I've really come land, sea, and air at this. 'Kay. .over time. <STOP> <START> There's only thing that could be so urgent. <STOP> <START> Checkin' in for his flight? <STOP> <START> Hard no. <STOP> <START> Uh, a lot of airlines overbook their flights anticipating noshows. <STOP> <START> And if you don't check in you're hooped. <STOP> <START> But still, to be at the airport, at the urinal, on your iPad, with your. <STOP> <START> Dick out? <STOP> <START> Your horn, yeah. <STOP> <START> Dick. <START> Won't make a habit of it. <STOP> <START> To be at the airport, at the urinal, on your iPad, with your dick out, there's got to be more at stake than a missed flight. <STOP> <START> Have you ever missed a flight? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Me neither. 'Kay. <STOP> <START> Bet it sucks, though. <STOP> <START> Still, airport, iPad, urinal, dick out. <STOP> <START> Like let's get real here. <STOP> <START> You get real. <STOP> <START> You get real. <STOP> <START> The dude's important. <STOP> <START> Or he's got someone really important to answer to, if his iPad work couldn't wait till after he rocked one. <STOP> <START> Big time. <START> What's he putting into the iPad is what I want to know. <STOP> <START> L'il help? <STOP> <START> L'il help. <START> Wanna know what he's puttin' in the iPad? <STOP> <START> I can tell you what he's putting in the iPad. <STOP> <START> Here's what he's putting into the iPad. <STOP> <START> The codes. <STOP> <START> The codes? <STOP> <START> Those codes. <STOP> <START> That's a thing that could be so urgent. <STOP> <START> That's the one thing that could be so urgent. <START> What a goof. <STOP> <START> To be at the airport at the urinal, with your iPad, your dick out. <STOP> <START> Silly. <STOP> <START> This nut sac is one in a chain of commanding political figures with access to the codes to green light a nuclear strike. <STOP> <START> That's who he is. <STOP> <START> And he had to get his portion of the codes in immediately, so that the warheads could take flight. <START> Why's he firing a warhead? <START> Well, someone would have had to fire a warhead first, right? <STOP> <START> You know, if I'm that dude at the airport, with my dick out, working on my iPad, I mean, the whole fuckin' world's at stake. <STOP> <START> There's multiple warheads? <STOP> <START> Both sides would have to have warheads in the air or projectiles, if it's nuclear war, yes. <STOP> <START> Those are some stakes. <START> What else could be so urgent? <STOP> <START> Not much else could be so urgent. <STOP> <START> So the other three in the political chain of command had already entered their portion of the codes and they just needed, we'll call him Gary, to enter his portion of the codes. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <START> What? <START> Wonder how Gary's working it? <START> What are we talking about here, the iPad or the. <STOP> <START> Or. <STOP> <START> Both. <STOP> <START> Both? <STOP> <START> Curious as to whether he had one hand on his horn and one on the iPad. <STOP> <START> Because if he's pissing handsfree, then he'd get the codes typed in much faster. <STOP> <START> Oh, way faster. <STOP> <START> At least twice as fast. <STOP> <START> Yeah, and he's in a hurry for sure, 'cause of the codes. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> JeanClaude. <STOP> <START> JeanLance. <STOP> <START> JeanClaude. <STOP> <START> JeanLance. <STOP> <START> Go sit down and drink your beer. <START> What if I don't?
