‐In her pen.
‐Why?

‐She's being punished.
‐Why?

320

her stud again.

Well, fucked if I know, Dan.

324
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:33,766
It's supposed to be natural
for animals to want to breed.

325
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,300
And fucked if those pups

326
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,133
wouldn't be as beautiful
as she is.

327
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,400
She was a beautiful pup.

328
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:39,533
She's a beautiful dog.

329
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,666
She was a gorgeous pup.

330
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,266
Well, she's a gorgeous dog.

331
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,733
But why is she in her pen?

332
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:45,400
It's 'cause aggression's
to be discouraged.

333
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:47,366
It's like Cesar Millan says,

334
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,100

and affection,

335
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,566
in that order.

336
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,066
I'd have a Bloody Caesar.

337
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,433
Do you wanna know what?
I'd have a Caesar, too.

338
00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:56,333
I could have a Caesar if you
guys are havin' Caesars.

339
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:57,766
Hard to see a Caesar
and not want a Caesar.

340
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,566
That's actually how
they market Caesars.

341

I bet ya she's got
some studs for Stormy.

343
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,633
Well, better to let
the dust settle

344
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,733
on Modean's burn‐down
before I bug her.

345
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:09,033
We need a new bar
in this town.

346
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:11,666
But why's Stormy trying
to kill all her studs?

347
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,300
'Cause they're sayin'
the wrong things, likely,

348
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,433
just like humans.

349
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:16,100
First line better be a winner.

350
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,333
First impression's
a lasting one.

351
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:18,766
Like what?

352
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,400
Well, to be honest,

353
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:21,600
I've taken to breaking the ice

354
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:24,200
with the lyrics from
'90s pop songs.

355
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:25,266
The words are penetrating

356
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,633
because she's likely
heard 'em before,

357
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,733
but she likely won't realize
it when they're spoken

358
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,500
rather than sung
with musical accompaniment.

359
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:33,100
Five bucks says you cannot
successfully sell me on this.

360
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,266
Hey, girl, give me your heart.

361

or else forget about it.

WAYNE: Hold it!

638
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:31,115
End of the laneway.
Don't come on the property.

639
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:33,081
‐Rematch.
‐K.

640
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,448
Knocked you out.
Can't believe you got back up.

641
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:37,915
You come here
to throw fists

642
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:39,115
or flap lips there,
big shooter?

643
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:40,248
You suckered him.

644
00:23:40,281 --> 00:23:41,881
Still knocked him
the fuck out.

645
00:23:41,915 --> 00:23:42,981
Then he got back up
and knocked you out.

Good amount of chin‐wagging
goin' on over there.

649
00:23:49,148 --> 00:23:50,848
All right, I suckered you.

650
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:52,115
So we shake hands,
clear the air,

651
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:53,348
then we square off.

652
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:54,548
