1
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:13,433
You're having thirsty Thursday

2
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:15,133
with your pals the other day.

3
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:19,233
It was my cousin's sixth
birthday party yesterday.

4
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:21,100
‐Which cousin?
‐Samuel.

5
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:22,466
I fuckin' hate Samuel.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,566
‐Well, Samuel likes you.
‐Fuckin' hate Samuel so much.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,300
Well, Samuel's not so bad.

8
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,633
I seen Samuel in the laundry
room with the cat one time.

9
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:30,700
You just know
that little fucker's

10
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:32,233
gonna put him in the dryer.

11
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,600
That's a hasty conclusion.

12
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,466
Not if you seen
Samuel trying to put himself

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,200
in there 15 minutes earlier.

14
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,466
I seen Samuel snort a line of
Fun Dip on his fifth birthday.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,700
Well, it's reason
fuckin' five million

16
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,200
I didn't go to his
sixth birthday party.

17
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,633
He was doing
a Fun Dip dry rip.

18
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,733
A what?

19
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:47,633
Or rippsin' a Fun Dip dry one.

20
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,066
Well, what's that?

21
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,266
Well, in schneef terms,

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,400
if you do a line of schneef
before you've ingested

23
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:54,366
any booze to
alter your judgment,

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,466
it's called doing a dry rip.

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,666
Or rippsin' a dry one.

26
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,066
Doin' dry rips is
a pretty good indication

27
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,366
you got a schneef problem.

28
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,066
You got yourselves
a schneef issue.

29
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,500
Well, yous
ever done a dry rip?

30
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:04,100
‐Well, back in the day.
‐In the glory days.

31
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,033
‐Yeah, I done a dry rip.
‐I'd a rips a dry one.

32
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,733
Not sure if rippin'
a Fun dip dry rip would

33
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:13,133
have the same effect,

34
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,700
but doin' it is still
a pretty good indication

35
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:16,100
you got some sort of problem.

36
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:17,266
Well, hoopin' Fun Dip

37
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,733
definitely wouldn't
have the same effects,

38
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:20,133
but it's
definitely an indication

39
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,566
you got yourselves a problem.

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,100
Well, what's hoopin'?

41
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,566
Well, that's instead of taking
the drugs orally's or

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,033
intranasally's, you
take 'em anally's.

43
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:29,566
What the fuck
you talking about now?

44
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,800
Well, instead of down
the hatch or up the nose,

45
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,700
you take 'em in the pooper.

46
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:35,366
Wait, you put
drugs up your pooper?

47
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,466
That's the fastest
way to absorbs

48
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,466
'em into your systems.

49
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,066
Do you mean like you take
the drugs with your hand...

50
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,766
Well, then you put
'em up your pooper?

51
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,200
Correct.

52
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,466
But you don't poop 'em out?

53
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,033
No, your pooper absorbs 'em.

54
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,166
Well, isn't that curious.

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,700
Hoopin' Fun Dip definitely

56
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:53,300
wouldn't have the same
effect as hoopin' schneef.

57
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,366
But doing it is still probably
a pretty good indication

58
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,700
you got some
sort of a problem.

59
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:58,733
I guess a Fun Dip dick dinger

60
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:00,400
wouldn't be
the ends of the world.

61
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,066
You wanna know what? I heard
my friends J. P. and J. W.

62
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,233
talk about Fun Dip
dick dingers one time.

63
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:05,533
Well, whose dick
was gettin' dinged?

64
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,133
Well, I thought it was
a bit intrusive to ask

65
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,433
whose dick was gettin' dinged.

66
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:10,433
As long as they're
both consentin' adults,

67
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:12,333
it really doesn't matter
whose dick's gettin' dinged.

68
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,766
Well, I really hope
the Fun Dip candy stick

69
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,233
isn't going
to waste in all this.

70
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:16,533
Do you wanna know what?

71
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:18,333
I pulled my first all‐nighter
with my friend Chad

72
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:20,466
in grade eight playing
Pokemans and eating Fun Dip.

73
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,533
Oh, waits.

74
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,200
If...

75
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:25,366
If Samuel's
already been takin'

76
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,100
Fun Dips orally's
and intranasally's...

77
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:33,200
Yeah, we should probably
go check on Samuel.

78
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,766
I fuckin' hate Samuel so much.

79
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,666
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

80
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,733
You got any dates lined up
this week, good buddy?

81
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:02,233
Nah, I'm gonna
put that bullshit

82
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,266
on the back burner
for a bit, bud.

83
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,300
Soft, literally.

84
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,733
Parks 'er behind
the barn for a bits?

85
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:08,466
‐Ten‐ply.
‐No.

86
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,133
Gotta find Stormy a stud.
That's a priority.

87
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,233
She's a beautiful dog.

88
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:13,400
Oh, she's a real beauty.

89
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:14,600
No, she's a gorgeous dog.

90
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,233
She just tries to kill
her studs, is the thing.

91
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,033
Well, that's my girl.

92
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,733
Maybe you should takes her
in for a fingers in the bum.

93
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,600
Are you fuckin' preoccupied?

94
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:24,066
That's only
the answer sometimes.

95
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,533
Squirrelly Dan
working' Squirrelly OT.

96
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:26,600
Not all the time.

97
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:28,233
‐Just to checks.
‐Sometimes.

98
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,466
Are you fuckin' preoccupied?

99
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,400
Doesn't matter what
you takes her in for.

100
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:34,133
As sure as a bush
is gonna break your fall,

101
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,633
Stormy's gonna get
some fingers in the bum.

102
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,500
‐How deep?
‐Fuck's sake.

103
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,533
‐What do ya means, how deep?
‐How many knuckles?

104
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:41,266
Like how many knuckles deep?

105
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,133
Yeah, are we talking
about a one‐knuckler

106
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,233
or a two‐knuckler?

107
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,333
Oh, be at least
a three‐knuckler

108
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:45,400
to gets to the bottom of this.

109
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,333
Oh, see, now, that's too many.

110
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:47,600
Is not.

111
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:49,200
Well, a person's
got two knuckles

112
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,366
so you're saying that
the vet would have to

113
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,800
fire a three‐knuckler
up Stormy's bum

114
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,233
to get to the bottom of it?

115
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,500
A person has three knuckles.

116
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:56,033
Well, a person
has two knuckles.

117
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,566
‐Figure it out.
‐A person has three knuckles.

118
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,266
You figure it out.

119
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,266
A person's got
two knuckles, okay?

120
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,500
‐One, two.
‐Three.

121
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:04,733
You forgots about
the little knuckles

122
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,500
underneath the fingernails.

123
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:07,666
Well, see now, that's not
a knuckle, though, Dan.

124
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,600
To be a knuckle,
you gotta be able to

125
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:10,433
punch somebody with it.

126
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:11,466
You can't punch
somebody with the knuckle

127
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,133
underneath the
fingernail, can you?

128
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,366
Can too.

129
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,533
Well, you'll be
looking pretty fuckin' silly.

130
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:18,733
First knuckle, one knuckler.
Second knuckle, two‐knuckler.

131
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:21,133
Third knuckle, three‐knuckler.

132
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,300
So then by your logic
the vet would have to

133
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,033
fire a full
finger up Stormy's bum

134
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,466
‐to get to the bottom of it.
‐Correct.

135
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,433
See, I'm just not so
goddamn sure I can stand by

136
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:29,433
and watch the vet give Stormy
a three‐knuckler up the bum.

137
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:30,533
No, I don't think
Stormy would need

138
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:31,500
a three‐knuckler up the bum.

139
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:32,800
Well, thank you, Dary,
because then you'd think

140
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,566
the vet's a bit funny,
would you not?

141
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,033
Mmm, a person has
three knuckles, though.

142
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,000
Thank you, Dary.

143
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,400
Fuck's sake, go ahead
and have a fuckin' fight

144
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:39,700
with your first knuckle then.

145
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:42,266
KATY: You'll be lookin'
pretty fuckin' silly.

146
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,500
Yeah, but when we're
talkin' about a two‐knuckler,

147
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,466
we're talking about
horizontal knuckles.

148
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,400
I'm gonna stop you there.

149
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:48,633
By your logic,

150
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:52,200
a six‐knuckler can be dealt
with using these two fingers?

151
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:54,233
‐Correct.
‐Incorrect.

152
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:56,566
No such thing
as a six‐knuckler.

153
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,500
A six‐knuckler existed,
I'd know about it.

154
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,133
‐How are ya now, Gail?
‐Good, and you?

155
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,466
‐Not so bad.
‐Got a stud for Stormy.

156
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,466
Comes from the
Baumgartner breeders.

157
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,233
Name's Ken.

158
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,700

00:12:43,758 --> 00:12:44,858
Fuck, yeah.

320
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:46,425
I've got another
stud for Stormy.

321
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,458
Fuck you.

322
00:12:48,558 --> 00:12:50,425
Give me half hour.

323
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,925
Well, I'll go run 'er.
Might help.

324
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:53,891
Little exercise.

325
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:57,858
Discipline and
affection in that order.

326
00:12:57,891 --> 00:12:59,291
Hey, Dan, do you
know another name for

327
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:01,258
Ecstasy is Dancin' Shoes?

328
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,791
'Cause it makes me
wanna dance.

329
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:09,825
Makes me wanna hug.

330
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:11,691
I get real huggy
when I'm on the ecstasy's.

331
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:12,958
Ecstasy bear.

332
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:14,691
Somethin' about
that drug, you know.

333
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,325
You just wanna
reach around and

334
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:17,891
enjoy the tactile sensations

335
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,425
that make up
this fabulous world.

336
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,858
Wide worldy bear.

337
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:22,558
Yeah, just...

338
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:23,391
Just wanna hold people.

339
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:33,491
(SLURPS)

340
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,325
Okay, how can I help?

341
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:40,358
‐Rock bottom, boys.
‐Rock bottom, ferda.

342
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:41,825
Ferda.

343
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:43,525
Boys, do you know
I think that there is a reason

344
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:45,325
why you found me.

345
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,258
Well, yeah, I mean,
you were waiting for us.

346
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,891
Kinda right by the door.

347
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:51,591
Okay, I think
there's a reason...

348
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,625
(WHISTLES)

349
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,958
...that y'all found me, okay?

350
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:57,891
You found me
because you need guidance.

351
00:13:57,925 --> 00:14:00,325
You're... You're lost.

352
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:01,958
Nowhere to turn.

353
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:05,491
And do you know what I say to
those who need guidance?

354
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,791
Do you know what
I say to those who are lost?

355
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:10,491
Who have nowhere to turn?

356
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:12,358
I say turn to him.

357
00:14:12,391 --> 00:14:14,425
‐Turn to who?
‐God.

358
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,325
Can't we just
talk to you, buddy?

359
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:17,825
Yeah. Talk to God.

360
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,758
Why do we have to talk to God?
Why can't we just talk to you?

361
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,491
‐You're right here.
‐Well, I...

362
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:22,025
I understand but we're
all saying the same thing.

363
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:23,291
I'm here, I'm the one.

364
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:24,791
I'm a conduit.

365
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:25,791
I'm the one that...
I'm the messenger that...

366
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:27,291
Talk to me.

367
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,558
I'm your
spiritual counselor, okay?

368
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:29,991
‐You can talk to me.
‐Thanks, buddy.

369
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:32,391
‐Sick, buddy.
‐All right.

370
00:14:32,425 --> 00:14:34,891
So, I think to get to
the root of your problem

371
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:38,391
we need to figure out here,
together, where did it begin?

372
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:39,858
‐Sick, buddy.
‐Sick.

373
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:42,291
‐Boys, where did it all begin?
‐What?

374
00:14:42,325 --> 00:14:43,525
‐Oh, do you mean when?
‐No.

375
00:14:43,558 --> 00:14:45,358
Yes, actually. Yes.

376
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:46,858
‐Thanks.
‐Surprise.

377
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:49,558
When, when
did the problem start?

378
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:52,325
Oh, um... When...

379
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,525
‐When we lost...
‐She we do not speak of.

380
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:55,991
‐Ooh, Katy?
‐No.

381
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:58,391
Yes. Just,
we do not speak of her.

382
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:00,958
Then, yes, but, buddy,

383
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:02,591
we're talking
about her right now so...

384
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,991
We're speaking
of her to try to make it

385
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:05,891
so she isn't "she we
do not speak about" anymore.

386
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:07,558
Yeah, I know, but is
that even okay, buddy?

387
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:09,425
Oh, my God. Yes. It's fine.
It's fine. It's okay.

388
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,891
It's okay.

389
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:12,058
I want you to
think about this.

390
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:13,791
I want you to hear this and
I want you to think about it.

391
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:14,891
I want you to think about

392
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:16,325
how many fish
there are in the sea,

393
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:17,758
'cause there's a lot of them.

394
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,558
A lot of fish in the sea and
there's a lot of fish on menus

395
00:15:19,591 --> 00:15:21,591
and most often
good restaurants

396
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,525
have a lot of fish on them.

397
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:23,891
And I want you to think,
"Look at this menu.

398
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:24,991
"Have I tried all this fish?

399
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,825
"Have I thought,
do I want fish?

400
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:29,291
"Oh, what's this?
Oh, this is a shellfish.

401
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:31,391
"That looks like calamari,
I wanna try that."

402
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:33,758
Oh, you mean like
our big city slams?

403
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,558
I guess we could call up
our big city slams, bro.

404
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:37,758
I didn't... I didn't mean
that at all, but fine.

405
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:38,958
Do whatever you want.

406
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:41,691
‐Big city slams, ferda.
‐Ferda!

407
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:45,625
Hey, it's never gonna
make sense to me.

408
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:47,225
Where are you going?
He has the car.

409
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,025
See? I told you.

410
00:15:49,058 --> 00:15:49,858
It's his...

00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:54,825

(COUGHS)

414
00:16:04,525 --> 00:16:05,325
I gagged.

415
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:13,991
‐Gail, how are ya now?
‐Good, and you?

416
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:16,425
‐Not so bad.

Boy, howdy.

419
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,625
Got another stud for Stormy.

420
00:16:21,658 --> 00:16:23,458
Comes from the
Buchburger breeders.

421
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:24,791
Name's Kelly.

422
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:25,858
‐Kelly Buchburger?
‐Yeah.

423
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:29,691
Okay.

424
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:30,825
The Buchburgers have been
breedin' German Shepherds

425
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:32,958
out in Arva for 16 years.

426
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,825
They're outgoin'. Strong.

427
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:37,825
And heavy‐boned.

428
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:39,358
‐WAYNE: So he's in the truck?
‐Yeah.

429
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:40,591
Well, pull around back,

430
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,525
we'll see if
they'll have a go.

431
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:42,858
Gotta say, Wayne,

432
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:45,025
if it doesn't work out
with Kelly Buchburger,

433
00:16:45,058 --> 00:16:46,358
you're approaching
the bottom of the well.

434
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:49,258
Oh, bother.

435
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,358
I was sure you had
a winner in Ken Baumgartner.

436
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:52,891
You could always use his
brother, Nolan Baumgartner.

437
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:54,491
If you don't want to sedate...

438
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:56,291
I've had just abouts
enough of that talks, Gail.

439
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:58,391
If you're past a knuckle
or two up the bum.

440
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:00,625
It'd take three knuckles to
gets to the bottom of this.

441
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:02,358
I'd say Stormy's
just not fit for breedin'.

442
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:03,991
But she's a beautiful dog.

443
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:06,325
‐She's such a beautiful dog.
‐A real beauty.

444
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,725
She's a gorgeous dog.

445
00:17:07,758 --> 00:17:09,491
Yeah, but she keeps
on tryin' to kill her studs.

446
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:10,625
Well...

447
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:20,325

448
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,325
My Instagram
is just blowing up.

449
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:35,725
Oh, my goodness.

450
00:17:35,758 --> 00:17:37,858
Oh! Yes, Katy.

451
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,991
To be clear, I wanna sign you.

452
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:40,858
So you're
gonna call me, right,

453
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:42,691
even if it's just to talk?

454
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:44,991
I am gonna lay
everything out for you.

455
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:46,691
All your pretty options.

456
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,425
We're gonna start
with a tour of the office.

457
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,025
Maybe a low‐cal lunch.

458
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:51,725
But you have
to come to the city.

459
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:54,025
I really can't do anything
here in Letterkenny.

460
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:55,591
So you're
gonna call me, right?

461
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,025
‐Yes.
‐Awesome. Cool.

462
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:58,658
‐Talk soon. Okay?
‐Okay.

463
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:01,258
Hey, Katy‐Kat?

464
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,558
‐Hey, Katy?
‐(CHUCKLES)

‐Gail, how are ya now?
‐Good, and you?

468
00:18:54,891 --> 00:18:55,925
Not so bad.

469
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,825
Got the perfect
stud for Stormy.

470
00:18:57,858 --> 00:19:00,758
My cousin up in Tobermory
will be here with him later.

471
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,291
This dog is different.

00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:03,891
Strong, silent type.

00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,658
Hard worker. No bullshit.

474
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:07,558
‐Fuck, I'd do him.
‐Sounds like a good guy.

475
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:08,658
Sounds like a real good guy.

476
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:09,925
Probably a real good guy.

477
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,458
‐This is the one, cowboy.
‐Okay.

You can trust this old goat.

So your cousin's coming up
later with the stud?

480
00:19:14,991 --> 00:19:15,791
Yeah.

What are we
gonna do till then?

Ah, you're fuckin'
lookin' at it, super chief.

483
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,558
Well, you know,
back in the day...

Back in the glory days.

485

We'd hoover some schneef.

yous been working
your way towards this

488

for about six weeks.

489
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:30,925
It's been a long, long time

490
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,691
since I've
hoovered some schneef.

491
00:19:32,725 --> 00:19:34,458
'Cause you were a fuckin'
degen when you did, Dan.

492
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:36,625
‐I was skinny.
‐And here's another thing.

493
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:37,991
You shouldn't
call it "schneef" anymore.

494
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:39,625
I think you
should call it "schniff."

495
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:40,691
‐Why?
‐'Cause it's funnier.

496
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,325
I think.

497
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:45,391
It's kinda like
that word "queef."

498
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:47,591
See, you can have a lot
of fun with that word queef.

499
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:51,458
But what's funnier, well,
I think, is the word "quiff."

500
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:52,958
I could hoover
a bit of schneef.

501
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,491

502

‐Pointless.
