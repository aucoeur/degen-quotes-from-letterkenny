1
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,333
You got invited
to a party the other day...

2
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:15,800
The McMurrays have invited us
over for a BBQ this afternoon.

3
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,200
That'll be a soft pass for me.

4
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:18,766
Just a soft pass?

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,766
A super...soft pass.
Well, why is that?

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,200
You got something else
on the go, big shooter?

7
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:23,700
Well, ah, you know,
it's just Saturday.

8
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:24,900
Rosie scooch on over.

9
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:26,633
Watch a little TV.
Bob's your uncle.

10
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,033
Do I have to remind you

11
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:29,900
that you are in a long‐term
relationship.

12
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:33,400
And...?
And as such you are obliged
to partakes in some socials

13
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,100
stimulations from times to time,

14
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:37,766
lest the young lady
becomes rastless.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,200
Rastless?
Rastless.

16
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:40,933
Well, if it ain't broke,
don't fix it, bud.

17
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:42,200
Sure. But you can't just

18
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:43,833
watch TV and have sex
every night, Wayne.

19
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:45,766
Sometimes Netflix and chill
just ain't enough.

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,700
A young lady deserves more

21
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,366
than just Amazon Primes
and sexy times.

22
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,400
YouTube and lube
isn't gonna cut it.

23
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,966
You can't just stream it
and cream it, bud.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,933
There's more to life

25
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:54,800
than a little Hulu and
you‐screw, big brother.

26
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,266
Gotta step out
of your comfort zone.

27
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,766
There's not a goddamn thing
wrong with

28
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,666
a little Playstation
Vue and I service you.

29
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,666
Not a goddamn thing.

30
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,900
A little Project Free TV
and you service me.

31
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:04,666
A little Pirate Bay
with some sexual spray.

32
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,100
A couple of torrent sites
minus the bed lights.

33
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,800
What about a little satellite
and an overnight?

34
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:09,933
A little satellite
and tickle fight.

35
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:11,166
Invite a friend over
for Direct TV

36
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,233
and a menage a three.

37
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:13,166
Yeah, there's more to life

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,966
than a li'l HBO and a go,
big brother.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,966
You gotta step out
of your comfort zone.

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,033
Wanna know what? I don't know
who called it the comfort zone,

41
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:22,266
but I'm pretty sure
they called it that

42
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,700
'cause everything inside
that zone's good and comfy.

43
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:27,833
So once you get outside
of that zone, fuck...

44
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:30,333
Well, that's when things
can get a bit dicey.

45

Oh! Ooh.
Welcome to Chez McMurray.

48
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,766
MR. MCMURRAY: Oh, ho.

00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,100
Or, Fort McMurray.

Here you go, babe.

52
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,266
Whatever you're into
that's what I always say.

53
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,800
ALL: McMurray!
MCMURRAY: Wayne, how're you now?

54
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,733
WAYNE: How'r you... Oh good.
MCMURRAY: Not s'bad.

55
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:01,100
WAYNE: I'm not s'...
MCMURRAY: I'm good.

56
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:03,266
Just go!
Where... where is your
better half, Wayne?

57
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,600
Reading a book.

58
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,166
All right. Well,

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,000
everybody make yourself
at home.

60
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:11,666
We got cold beer
and frozen marg mix.

61
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,633
Oh, yeah. You got blueberry,
avocado passion fruit margs?

62
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,766
We got agave prickly pear
marg mix.

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,066
Mhh hmm. Colada mix, too.

64
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,633
You got kiwi fruit cucumber
jalapeno pina colada?

65
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:21,900
We got charred orange
ruby red grapefruit

66
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,300
pomegranate pina coladas.

67
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,800
Even got daiquiri mix, too.

68
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,133
Oh, you got

69
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,200
whole citrus hungry gal
magic low cal daiquiris?

70

Good enough.

00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:36,366
Whatever you're into
is what I always say.

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,566
That's right.

75
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,900
Plus, we got a shit ton of super
fun shit planned for today.

76
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:41,200
Oh, boy.
All kinds.

77
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:42,900
Just went down and got myself

78
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:45,866
a brand spankin' new karaoke
machine down at the swap meet.

79
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,066
Oh, boy.
It's only got the Chinese songs,
but it works just fine.

80
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,233
All right, lemme run down
the house rules.

81
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:54,666
Rule number one:
You must have fun.

82
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,366
That's it.
That's the only fuckin' rule.

83
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,566
That's easy to remembers then.

84
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,866
I hope everybody remembered
to bring their swim trunks.

85
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,833
GLEN: Come on down, folks.
Don't be shy.

86
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:06,266
The jets are powerful and
the water is warm.

87
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,066
Plenty room for everybody.

88
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,166
Amen. Oops. Oh, no. I went ahead
and dropped an olive.

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,066
Oh!
Oh, ooh...

90
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,633
There it is.
Oh.

91
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,000
I feel it.

92
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,200
Sure do...

93
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,166
Thank you, Gail.

94
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,966
I forgot my swim trunks, so...

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,700
You forgot to bring a set?
Didn't bring a set.

96
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:25,100
You didn't bring a set?
Didn't bring a set.

97
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,900
You didn't bring a set?
I didn't brings no sets.

98
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:28,766
You, even you didn't bring
a set?
I didn't bring a set.

99
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,966
Don't worry.

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,966
We got a whole bunch of extra
swim trunks in the closet.

101
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
So no fuckin' excuses, okay?

102
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,133
I'd hammer a cock suckin' gin
and tonic, that's all I know.

103
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,200
Who wants to jump in the tub,

104
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:40,933
or... can I offer somebody
some fruit?

105
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:43,066
Or maybe an oyster?

106
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,366
Where is Wayne?
Out having a dart, likely.

107
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,333
Hm.
MCMURRAY: Thought Wayne
would love a good tub?

108
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:50,766
Who wouldn't love a good tub?

109
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,000
Well, he does.

110
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,966
He just says that if you spend
too much time in the water,

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,633
you end up looking like
a golden raisin.

112
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,033
I think I just brushed up

113
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:58,933
against a couple
of golden raisins.

114
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:00,966
Gail, oh, my. Scandal.
Hmmm.

115
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,766
Would anyone care
to play a game?

116
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,000
Has anybody ever played
Never have I ever?

117
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:07,233
Nevers.
Never?

118
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:09,100
Never ever.
Not even once.

119
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:10,866
It is a dandy little
drinking game

120
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,733
we picked
up down 'Minican.

121
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:14,366
We go down 'Minican
twice a year, that's all I know.

122
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,766
Still don't get down
'Minican enough, baby,

123
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,966
that's true.

124
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,833
Was down 'Pulco pertnear
every winter 'til fellas started

125
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:20,900
gettin' hanging from bridges
with their dinks cut off.

126
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:21,933
Crying shame

127
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:23,900
because Sinatra used to have
a place down 'Pulco.

128
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:25,133
You know, JFK and Jackie O

129
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,500
had their goddamn honeymoon
down 'Pulco.

130
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,300
But we picked up Never Have
I Ever down in 'Minican.

131
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,866
K.
So, how it works
is this.

132
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,033
You say, "Never have I ever"

133
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:35,400
done such and such a titillating
and or embarrassing act

134
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:37,700
and if you've done it,
you drink it. Get it?

135
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,833
Got it.
I'll start.

136
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:42,066
Fire away, baby.
And make it randy.

137
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,200
Oh, yeah.

138
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,066
(SQUEALS)

139
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:49,033
Uh, let's see, never have
I ever

140
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:52,266
made whoopee with
more than one person at a time.

141
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,266
We're going from zero
to sixty I take it.

142
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,833
MCMURRAY: Uh hm. Oh.

143
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:58,833
Your turn, baby.
All right.

144
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:03,133
Never have I ever felt
strong sexual urges

145
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:07,133
towards another spouse,
significant other or sibling.

146
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,600
That's very specific.

147
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:13,666
Hey, Wayne, how's your beer?

148
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,833
WAYNE: I'd have a beer.
MCMURRAY: Katy, don't...

149
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:18,033
Can you can bring me over
one of them cocksuckers,

150
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:19,000
that's what I always say.

151
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,133
Buddy,
I think we plateaued.

152
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,633
What are
you talking about, buddy?

153
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,600
Like I'm not seein'
any gains, bro.

154
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:32,333
I've been free posing
in front of the mirror at home.

155
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:35,100
Maybe it's time we did
a full circuit together, ferda.
Ferda.

(SQUEALING)

157
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,333
BOTH: Pose def...

158
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:00,866
I think you're right, buddy.

159
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,700
Yeah, I haven't seen
any gains all year, bro.

160
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,900
We gotta make some serious
gains for next season, ferda.

161
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:06,166
Capital gains, buddy.

162
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,166
Coach has already texted sayin'
how are the gains going, boys.

163
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,033
Saying what?

164
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:11,666
Saying, how are
the gains going, boys.

165
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,966
Can't let coach down,
buddy.

166
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,400
(SCOFFS) Not an option, bro.

167
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:15,266
He'll send something flying.

168
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,333
Scares the shit out of me,
sometimes.

169
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:19,100
Our gains have to eclipse
general team gains, buddy.

170
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:20,766
You wanna be the guy to walk
into the room

171
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,633
and none of
the boys see gains?

172
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,200
If gains fall in the forest
and no one's around

173
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:26,266
to see it, nobody really
sees any gains.

174
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,266
If you don't see gains,
what do you see?

175
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,200
BOTH: Excuses.
We can't be those guys,
buddy.

176
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:32,200
No excuses, buddy.
Clock's ticking, bro.

177
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:33,800
Not a lot of time
for gains, bro.

178
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,300
Charlotte Gains, bro.
No.

179
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,233
We need a surge of gains, bro.

180
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:39,900
Canseco, buddy.

181
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,700
Sammy Sosa, buddy.

182
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,000
At what cost, Buddy?

183
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:46,100
What's the cost of juice, buddy?

184
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,900
Maybe rip a quick half cycle.

185
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,966
Maybe we just dig deep.
Bare down.

186
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:51,766
Or...

187
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,066
Roger Clemens, buddy.

188
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,366
Hey!
What?

189
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,733
All‐Star pitcher, buddy.
Tarnished reputation, buddy.

190
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:57,833
Hey!
What?

191
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:59,966
Starting pitcher for the
Toronto Blue Jays, buddy.

192
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:03,100
Just a half cycle?

193
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,733
Just a quick half cycle.
Push through the plateau,

194
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:07,300
kick start the muscle fibers,

195
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,100
go cold turkey before
the season starts, buddy.

196
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:11,400
Cold turkey?
Cold turkey.

197
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:13,633
Au naturale.
Au naturale.

198
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,366
Naturale.
Au naturale.

199
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,166
Ferda.
Ferda.

200
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,666
Yeah, but wait!

201
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,033
Where do we get the juice from,
ferda?

202
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,866
Oh, I think I know
just the place, buddy.

203
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,200
Tanis? How'r...

204
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:36,000
...now?

205
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,966
So where's this party at?
Basement.

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,766
Don't see your swim trunks.
Didn't bring a set?
No, I didn't bring a set.

207
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,166
Well, inside they'll likely
have a set.
Didn't know I'd need that set.

208
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
They'll get you a set.

209
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,166
You know what the McMurrays
are up to, right?

210
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,366
I have an inkling.

211
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,166
And you don't mind leaving
your girl down there with them?

212
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,366
She didn't make the trek.
(CHUCKLES)

213
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,633
Reading?
Can't confirm.

214
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,866
Doesn't that make you think
she up to something?

215
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,633
Makes me think
it's a pretty good book.

216
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:05,166
Must be like...

217
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,100
Carrie?

218
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:12,800
Well, when the cat's away
the mice will play. Hmm?

219
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,133
The rats too, apparently.

220
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:19,066
You're dirty, huh.

221
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,966
All right,

222
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,166
I'm gonna go home.
I just came here for you, boo.

223
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,333
You know we have a really
big library on the Rez too,

224
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:29,100
if you're
into nerdy girls,

225
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,766
I can show you my spine label,
you can show me your hard cover.

226
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:34,366
On a...

227
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,333
KATY: How's your beer,
big brother?

228
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:46,966
I'd have a beer.

229
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So, tell me,

230
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:51,733
how do you boys feel
about havin' adventures?

231
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:53,200
Well, I'm not against
havin' adventures.

232
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,200
Then how do you feel
about trying new things?

233
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,966
Well, like I always say,

234
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,066
varieties is
the spices of life.

235
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,233
Mrs. McMurray and I
couldn't agree more.

236
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:02,700
That's all I know.

237
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:05,133
In fact, the more you get
to know us both,

238
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:08,933
the more you realize that
we're very broad‐minded.

239
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,400
That's what I always say.

240
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:11,933
Well, the other day,

241
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:13,800
I tried cinnamon chewing gum
for the first time.

242
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,933
Huh.
Well, it was a little bit
spicy for my taste,

243
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:17,333
I can't say
that I didn't like it.

244
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:20,800
Gotta love those spicy
little cocksuckers, uh?

245
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,100
Okay.

246
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,300
Katy, how's your beer?

247
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,766
KATY: I'd love a beer.

248
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,933
Oh, huh.

249
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,666
Ah, I lost another one.
Whoopsie daisy.

250
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,000
Slippery little buggers.

251
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,966
Oh! She's in the neighborhood.

252
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,133
Maybe it's time
to get going.

253
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,666
Agreed.
How do we do that?

254
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:47,266
Guess what?
DARYL AND KATY: What?

255
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,900
This may very well call for
the Irish Goodbye.

256
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:51,166
What's the Irish Goodbye?

257
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,133
Well, that's when you leave
without saying bye to anyone.

258
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,900
Also known as the French Exit
or Houdini.

259
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:57,966
Thought the French Exit
was when you climax on a gal,

260
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,266
and you leave without
cleaning it up.

261
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,866
It's almost not worth
thinking about, Dary.

262
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,000
Technically, a French Exit

263
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,400
is when you leave without
paying the bill.

264
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:05,166
But in this case,
that is not applicable.

265
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,733
Guess what?
BOTH: What?

266
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:09,166
This may very well call
for the Turkish Takeoff.

267
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,400
What's a Turkish Takeoff?

268
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:12,766
That's when you pull a fire
alarm and leave with a stranger.

269
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,166
Guess what?
BOTH: What?

270
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,066
This very well may call
for the old Tokyo Sayonara.

271
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,300
What's Tokyo Sayonara?

272
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,233
Well, that's when you leave
and only say goodbye to the cat.

273
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,000
Maybe this calls for...

274
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:24,366
No!
BOTH: What?

275
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:28,300
Maybe this calls for
the Letterkenny Leave.

276
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,266
No!
Letterkenny Leave?

277
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,033
That's when you steal
a two‐four

278
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:33,800
and walk through
a sliding glass door.

279
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,300
Well, desperate times.

280
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,700
Desperate measures.

281
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:43,233
I don't think we're there
just yet. But, why not,

282
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:45,233
let's continue to monitor
the situation.

283
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:47,666
Time for more mix.

284
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,233
I'll get the colada mix,
baby.

285
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,900
Dart?
I'd have a dart.

286
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,266
Squirrely Dan.
Waynes.

287
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,733
Has it occurred to you
that those two

288
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:00,900
may be members of...

289
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,233
Of the Lifestyle?

290
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:05,000
Like the agricultural
management lifestyle?

291
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:06,833
Sure they are.
No, Dan.

292
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,066
The Lifestyle.

293
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,266
Like the livestocks management
lifestyle. Of course they are.

294
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,666
No, Daniel.

295
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,266
The Lifestyle.

296
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,866
Oh, dairy farming lifestyle.

297
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,166
You guys know they are.

298
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,733
(YELLS) Squirrely Dan!
Uh‐hmm?

299
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:25,233
Uh, the Lifestyle?

300
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,833
No, I'm not too sure

301
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,100
what you're driving at here,
big shooter.

302
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,000
All righty.

303
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,866
Who wants to play
Pass the Banana?

304
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:53,866
Well, well, well,
my chemical bromance.

305
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,966
Bro Thornton
and Bro Jonas.

306
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,266
We're in the market for some
banned substances, buddy.

307
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,833
Oh, and you've come
to us.

308
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:03,100
How flattering.
We've got substances.

309
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:04,433
And guess what?

310
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:08,266
Newsflash, Bill "the thrill"
O'Reilly... they're all banned.

311
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,200
So what will it be,
Geoff and Rus Courtnall...

312
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,866
You know what a nose beer is?
Booger sugar.

313
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,966
...tini.
The cola.

314
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,300
BOTH: No.
No.

315
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,733
Then what will it be,
Wayne and Keith Primeau?

316
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:18,166
You into sextaxcy?

317
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,366
Rollsy pollsy's?
The beans?

318
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,700
The disco biscuits?

319
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,200
BOTH: No.
Do not tell me

320
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:24,133
you've come here
looking for pot.

321
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,100
No, no, we're looking for
some, uh...
Juice.

322
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:28,266
Huh?
Sauce.

323
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,033
Huh?
Gear.

324
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:32,200
BOTH: Steroids.
Ah!

325
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:34,200
A‐bombs.
Anti‐hero.

326
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,800
Gym candy. Why didn't you
say so?

327
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,966
JONESY: What the fuck? Jesus.

328
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,666
Edibles. You're welcome.
So, you wish to

329
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,100
improve upon that form
God gave you.

330
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,900
Just a half‐cycle, buddy.
Ah, sweet hubris.

331
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:50,966
Oh, what's that?
Excessive pride,

332
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,166
or self confidence.

333
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Arrogance. Pomposity.
Egotism.

334
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:57,833
One does not simply hop
on or of the Anabolia Express.

335
00:12:57,866 --> 00:12:59,133
No.

336
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:03,633
You ride that juice train all
the way to the end of the line.

337
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,133
Choo‐choo.

338
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,100
No, we're just trying
to push through a plateau, so...

339
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,900
Need more Charlotte Gains, bro.

340
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:10,166
Just a quick Serge
of Gains, bro.

341
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,300
Before the season starts,
going cold turkey.

342
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, au naturale.
Yeah.

343
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,933
(LAUGHING)

344
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:17,333
Famous last words,
gentlemen

345
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:18,800
Have you discussed
side effects?

346
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,866
What side effects?

347
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,266
Oh, just a little dilemma
known as severe back acne.

348
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,366
Bacne?
It's fine.

349
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,300
And a little complication,
acute testicular shrinkage.

350
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,866
Testicle shrinkage?

351
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,900
Nobody's testicles
are going to shrinkage, buddy.

352
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:32,233
Of course that

353
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:34,833
can of worms known
as 'roid rage.

354
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:36,166
That actually
happens, buddy.

355
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Almost to everyone, buddy.

356
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:40,866
Pay the man.
I mean, maybe we should just,
you know...

357
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,833
Dig deep, you know.
Bare down.

358
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:44,666
I mean, side effects, buddy.

359
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,300
But you guys should be good.
Yeah, we should be good.

360
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,266
Should be good.
Yeah? We should be good?

361
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,366
I wouldn't worry.
No.

362
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
No, it should be good.
For sure?

363
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:52,766
If you want my honest opinion,
you should be good.

364
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,400
'Cause if like you say
we're good...
You're good.

365
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,266
Yeah?
You should be good.

366
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,666
Wheel, snipe,
celly boys.

367
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,200
Yeah, dirty fuckin'
dangles, boys.

368
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:01,600
(YELLS) Pay the man.

369
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:05,633
Did I ever tell you
about my friend, Juan‐Jorge?

370
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,066
No, I don't believes
you haves.

371
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,766
Well, Juan‐Jorge is one of our
closest and dearest friends.

372
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,866
We met him
and his wife down 'Minican.

373
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,966
Mm‐hm.

374
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,300
Juan‐Jorge is a birdwatcher.

375
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,033
Or a "birder" as they prefer
to be called, these days.

376
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,800
Hmm.
Anyway, one day

377
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,266
in a hot tub, not unlike
this one,

378
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,266
Juan‐Jorge told first
me about the common cuckoo bird.

379
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
The cuckoo bird
has a peculiar habit

380
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,666
of laying its eggs
in another bird's nest.

381
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,366
Well, that is
a peculiars habits.

382
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,366
And it is from
this peculiar habit,

383
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,300
that we get the English term

384
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,733
cuckold.

385
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:36,800
Huh.

386
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,633
Are you familiar with
that term, Squirrely Dan?

387
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,666
I believes I have heards
in passings, yes.

388
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,733
Juan‐Jorge believes cuckoldry

389
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:46,000
to be the purest and highest
form of sexual arousal.

390
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:48,733
This Juan‐Jorge sounds
like a real interestings fellas.

391
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:50,633
Uh‐hmm.
You better believe it,

392
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:54,000
that's all I've got to say.
Oh, you better believe it.

393
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:56,800
In fact, according to Juan‐Jorge

394
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:00,966
only the sweet, sweet agony
and pure psychological torment

395
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,366
of watching a physically
superior man

396
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,733
pleasure his beloved wife

397
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:07,233
is enough
to truly excite him.

398
00:15:07,266 --> 00:15:09,300
Just look at this big ol'
paw of yours, huh?

399
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,666
Look at that cocksucker, baby.

400
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,766
See, now most people think

401
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,000
just about one fella sleeping
with another's wife,

402
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:17,900
but no, Juan‐Jorge believes

403
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,800
and explains in such
an arrangement,

404
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,366
that the real and
true connection is in fact,

405
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,233
between the bull...

406
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,666
And the cuckoo bird,
so to speak.

407
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,300
Huh. Daryl, how's your beer?

408
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,866
DARYL: Yeah, I could
have a beer.

409
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,333
Maybe it's time
we pulls a Brexit.

410
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:49,600
WAYNE, KATY AND DARYL: Shh.

411
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,333
Guess what?
ALL: What?

412
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:57,833
It very well maybe time
to pull the Singapore Scram.

413
00:15:57,866 --> 00:15:59,133
What's a Singapore Scram?

414
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,666
It's when you grab
onto a rope wire

415
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,866
and have a helicopter fly
you out of there.

416
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,166
Nobody's flying away
anywhere, that's all I know.

417
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,133
Hell, no. It's karaoke time.

418
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,666
ALL: Over and out.

419
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,300
What's on the menu
this evening, my dear?

420
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,700
I need my rits.
Hmm.

421
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:16,033
Burning the candle
at both ends, are we?

422
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:17,966
Finals are coming.
I need my rits to study.

423
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,066
Well, don't move.

424
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,033
Darien.

425
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,833
The Ritalin.

426
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:26,966
Good luck on your exams.

427
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:32,133
These aren't my rits.
Come again?

428
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,100
Anabolic steroids.

429
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:35,800
Those are 'roids
not 'rits.

430
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,933
But that means...
I need my rits.

431
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:39,866
That means you sold
the gym rats rits,

432
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,933
not 'roids,
you rapscallion.

433
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:44,133
I need my rits not 'roids.

434
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,400
Those were meant
to be rits not 'roids.

435
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:49,300
Yet, here we are,
'roids not rits.

436
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,366
Uh hm. Rit‐tidiculous.
Oh, 'roid‐ally.

437
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,733
(SCREAMS) Rits!

438
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,333
Locked and loaded, bro.

439
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:00,433
Bring on the gains, boys.
Capital gains, boys.

440
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:03,100
Charlotte Gains, bro.
A quick Serge of Gains, bro.

441
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,300
Focus is?
Traps and tri's buddy.

442
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,233
Traps and tri's, bro.

443
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,933
We should be ripping
sand bell slammers.

444
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:09,500
We should be ripping
kettleball sumo deadlifts.

445
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:12,233
We should be ripping
standing V‐bar pushdowns.

446
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:13,366
We should be ripping cable
hammer curls

447
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,466

attachment.

448
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,900
We should be ripping close

449

450
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,466
We should be ripping

451
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,333
two arm barbell wide grip
preachers curls.

452
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:24,266
Like Arnold, buddy.
Uh‐hmmm.

453
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,866
(BOTH GRUNTING)

454
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:31,166
I don't know what's going on

455
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,133
but I don't feel like ripping
V‐Bar tricep pushdowns.

456
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,900
Maybe it's
the half cycle, buddy.

457
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:36,200
I know what you mean,
buddy.
Maybe we should rip

458
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,166
a full cycle, buddy.
Full cycle, buddy.

459
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,433
Ferds. Uh, great.

460
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:41,200
One more rip and then
we rip super sets

461
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:43,100

sand bell tricep extendies.

462
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,266
One more rip and we rip

466
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,366
We should be ripping bent

467
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,333

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Ferda.

472
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,100
So if we rip ten super sets

473
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:09,833
at a rate of ten or every
fifteen minutes, that's...

474
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:11,866
How many reps
per super set, buddy?

475
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,366
Twenty reps per super set.
Make that 30.

476
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,466
Done, buddy.
Now double it.

477
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,333
If we rip 60 reps per super set

478
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:18,066
at a rate of 10 every
15 minutes, that means

479
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,533
we'll need to rip sixteen
and a half

480
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,466
more half‐cycles
before the next season starts.

481
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,566
Can't let coach down, buddy.
Not an option, buddy.

482
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:25,300
It's beautiful.

483
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,933
We're gonna need
a bigger blackboard.

484
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:30,200
What's this, boys?

485
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:31,533
Nothing, Snipes.
Nothing, Snipes.

486
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:33,466
Does Ritalin help
get gains?

487
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Should we try it?
Rits not 'roids, then?

488
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,100
Those are rits.
Not 'roids?

489
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:41,000
BOTH: Rits not 'roids, boys.

490
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,900
Maybe we should

491
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:47,966
dig deep?
Bare down.

492
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,900
Natural gains, bro?

493
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:51,533
A Serge of Natural Gains, bro.

494
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,366
Au naturale.
Au naturale.

495
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,933
(SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

496
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:09,800
She's got the voice
of an angel, doesn't she?

497
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,133
Oh, it's catchy.

498
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,066
(SQUEALS)

499
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,900
Oof!
Bravo!

500
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,166
Bravo and brava.

501
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,000
And then there were four.

502
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:33,900
Oh, yeah.
I have a few ground rules
I'd like to cover.

503
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:36,033
Pertaining to...
Shoot.

504
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:37,933
No open mouth kissing

505
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:39,400
on the mouth.
Pardon?

506
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:42,566
Observed.
Figging and cupping
and light electro‐play

507
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,766
are all on the table.

508
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,233
But I do have soft limits on K9
role play and mummification.

509
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:50,133
GLEN: Excuse me?
Observed.

510
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:54,133
No tushy play unless
I ask for it and I will ask

511
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:55,533
for it.

512
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:56,900
What?
Observed.

513
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:57,833
Once we get started,

514
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:59,933
it is recommended that
you do not look me

515
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,066
directly in the eye.

516
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,966
Safe word.
Huh?

517
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,966
Close, Glen,
but my safe word is uhunn.

518
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,466
Once again?
Uhunnn!

519
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,433
Oh! Oh, my,
you all are polyamorous.

520
00:20:12,466 --> 00:20:13,533
BOTH: Bingo!

521
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:15,200
Despite being in wedlock.

522
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:16,400
BOTH: Bulls‐eye.

523
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,133
Oh, that's a sin.

524
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,266
I'm going to have
to skedaddle.

525
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,566
Tokyo Sayonara
for me. Where's that kitty?

526
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,300
Squirrely Dan.
Uh‐huh?

527
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,500
So now do you see
what we mean by the Lifestyle?

528
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,300
Yup.

529
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,233
Who'd have thought the McMurrays
would've been the swinging type.

530
00:20:32,366 --> 00:20:34,566
I could have told you that
before we got over there, bud.

531
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,300
Nobody wouldsa thunk it.

532
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,933
Pertnear, everyone in town
thunk it.

533
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:39,533
Why do you think
Rosie stayed home to read?

534
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,033
It must be a pretty good book.

535
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:42,933
It must be like...

536
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,200
The Boy at The Leafs Camp.

537
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:48,233
They seem so normal.
Do they?

538
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,400
They walks among us...
Undetecteds.

539
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:54,500
Well, I say,
live and let live.

540
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:55,500
Oh, me too.

541
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:57,700
Yeah. To each his
and hers own. Am I right?

542
00:20:57,733 --> 00:21:00,400
Sure. But you wanna
know what?

543
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:03,200
It sure is nice
to be back in the comfort zone.

544

(PHONE VIBRATING)

545
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,433
Hi, Rosie.

546
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:13,900
... a little Crave
and misbehave?

547
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:16,933
Hard yes.
