Great day for hay.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,966
Wanna know
the worst part
about doing hay,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,700
is all the dust and debris
what gets up your beak.

(BLOWING)

Well, that's definitely
the top three worst
parts to doing hay, yeah.

8
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:28,566
Fuck sakes, Dan,
clean it up.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,900
That's what I was
doing, Ms. Katys.

10
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:31,433
Don't blow your nose
on your sleeve.

11
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:34,566
Well, how hard actually
works if you never
blown your nose on your shirt.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,033
KATY: Why are you
taking your boots off, Dary?

13
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:38,100
Is this the degen convention,
or what's the scoop?

14
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:39,400
Well how hard've you
actually worked

15
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:41,866
if you don't kick
your boots off
the second you're through?

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,733
Keep those flippers
away from me.

17
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:46,100
What? Don't wanna
my feet marinate
in my sweaty boots.

18
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,033
I suggest you don't let
that one marinate.

19
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:49,866
So you might get
toe‐nail fungus.

20
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,266

so moist in there.

It's like this.

156
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,033
Oh, okay.

157
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,766
I guess we better
go talk to Katy‐Kat, buddy.

158
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,200
Time to break it
to Kitty‐Kat, buddy,

159
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,866
but wait...

160
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,533
You seriously don't
wanna bang us,
you fucking liars?

161
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:45,733
Come crash my crease,
show stopper.

162
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:48,166
Two minutes for rough
and give me ten.
I'll get rougher.

163
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,700
Fuck the blue line.
Nothin's offside
over here. Try it.

164
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:53,166
I'll bulge your twine.
Just try and stop me.
You're gonna love it.

165
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,666
Sauce me a stretch pass,
I'll sauce you a stretch ass.

166
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,100
Let's bury
a howitzer, boys.

167
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:58,700
Send a howi, I'll get
a stick on it.

168
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,766
Let's go hip to hip.

169
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:08,000
Their names are
Shyla and Shania.

170
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:09,966
The two newest strays
on the Rez.

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
They stole Axe
and Slash from me.

172
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:12,766
And I'm pretty sure
they're banging them,

173
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,633
'cause they're fucking
banging everyone. Skanks!

174
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,033
They're selling
cigarettes to kids.

175
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:18,233
Yeah, well, kids are shit heads,
like the resilient ones.

176
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:19,633
They'd have found the darts
one way or another, fuck.

177
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,833
Excuse me, but I earned
the right to sell smokes
in Letterkenny,

178
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:25,166
and I never sold to anyone
under high school age.

179
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,233
I fucking checked IDs.

180
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,200
They called me a skank.
Game on!

181
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,600
I really miss
Axe and Slash.

182
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,133
I'm disappointed in them.

183
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,200
They're like
my buddies, you know.

184
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:35,200
So I find them
and beat the shit
out of them?

185
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,300
Well, I was starting to wonder
when the next scrap was coming.

186
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,766
Was starting to think
it was never gonna come.

187
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,300
And I'm not so sures
it's beating the shits
out of Axe and Slash

188
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,166
is gonna makes them
come backs to you, Tanis.

189
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,166
No, no, they need
their asses kicked.

190
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,133
Fucking done.
Every woman knows

191
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,066
the way to a man's heart
ain't through his zipper.

192
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,133
Can confirm.

193
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,200
It's through his stomach.

194
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:52,766
MEN: Can confirm.

195
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,533
And there is
a big cookout
on the Rez today,

196
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:57,633
and I am the cookout Queen.

197
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,933
Everyone comes my way.

198
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:01,900
So if Axe and Slash
don't come running,
I'm a fucking chimp.

199
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:03,100
What are you cooking?
What are you cooking?

200
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:04,166
Everything.

201
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,666
Bison burgers,
Walleye nuggets,
trout fillets,

202
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,100
Venison steaks, bannock,
fried bread...

203
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:12,300
and my famous Indian taco.

204
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,000
You'll have to roll me
out of there, Tanis.

205
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,833
Yeah, they got forklifts
on the Rez there Tanis?

206
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:17,300
Then she's bought
and paid for.

207
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,666
We cruise on in there,
eat like kings,

208
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,100
beat the shit out
of those dudes,

209
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:23,900
snatch up Axe and Slash,
and away we go.

210
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:25,200
Don't say that word.
What?

211
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,533
Oh.
MEN: Snatch.

212
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:28,666
You're gonna bring up
all those rich meats,

213
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,666
and now you don't wanna
talk about snatch‐erated fats?

214
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,166
What you never had
a Cabbage Snatch Kid growing up?

215
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
What'd you never had
a snatch‐and‐sniff sticker
when you were a kid?

216
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,700
Everyone loves
snatch‐and‐win bingo.

217
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:36,866
Fuck off.

218
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,533
How about that Robin Williams
movie, <i>Snatch Adams?</i>

219
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:41,100
That tugged at a few
heart‐strings.

220
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:43,033
My favorite part
of the <i>Simpsons</i> was
the <i>Itchy and Snatchy Show.</i>

221
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,766
What, you never see
Snathural Born Killers?

222
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,900
Margaret Snatcher was
the Prime Minister
of Great Britain.

223
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,666
Wonder if she ever met
Benedict Cumbersnatch.

224
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,833
He's from over there too, right?

225
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:51,300
Who wrote that song
Snatch My Bitch Up?

226
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,933
Definitely not Snatchbox 20.

227
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:54,633
Or Snatching Pumpkins.
What's the problem?

228
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:58,633
Shyla and Shania have a bunch
of guys with them so you
might wanna call in a favor.

00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,133
I'll holler one instead. Hey!

231
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:09,833
Remember when we backed
yous up on the Rez?

232
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,700
Yeah, that time
we didn't have
the Native Flu?

233
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:12,966
Payback time.

234
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,100
Good. Because we
definitely didn't have
the Native Flu.

235
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:17,300
DARYL: Snatchurally.
Scooby snatch.
What's the problem?

236
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,033
To the Rez, pink dicks.

(FINGERS SNAPPING)

238

The hour is upon us,
Bible thumper.

239
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,100
How'd you know, heathen?

240
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,933
You don't even
wear a watch.

241
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:31,733
What happened to
he who cast
the first stone?

242
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,566
A broken window likely.

243
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,733
And hopefully no one
seriously injured.

244
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,600
Tell me, preacher,

245
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:42,566
if your God found himself
in a comparable
turf war contingency,

246
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,266
what would
Jesus do?

247
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,033
Jesus would advocate
for empathy,
acceptance and grace.

248
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:52,866
Jesus might advise you
to take a whack
at his way of life.

249
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,200
Very well.
What?

250
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,800
Fuck it.

00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:02,966
that you sample ours.

I don't know, Stewart,
I'm hesitant.

Alors?

00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,766
D'accord.
Allons‐y.

260

You're just gonna let

sit uncovered, or...

263
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:38,966
Put the grill up to 500.
You wanna turn that down
a bit, or...

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,033
DAN: Montreal steak spice
would help that Bison meat.

265
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:42,866
So you gonna sprinkle
some on there or...

266
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,833
Sure you wanna put those
fish and veggies on
at the same time, or...

Yous wanna stop questioning

Still you're gonna squirt
a little marinate on there,
or...

269

Don't say that word.
What, marinate?

No.

that show when you were
a kid, Squirt and Ernie?

281
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,200
Katy was watching
Squirty Dancing
just yesterday.

282

Okay, that's a lie. I was
watching Squirty Dancing.
It's a great movie.

I think it's about time

the issue here boys,

on the grill right now.
What's the problem?

292
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:42,133
Really though, are you
gonna squirt a little
marinade on there, or...

296
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,833
Step one, guilt blasting'.

297
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:53,266
Take to the pulpit,

298
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,066
present yourself
to the congregation

299
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,700
and you really
just let 'em have it.

300
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,700
Goes something like this.

301
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,333
You're all guilty.
You're all sinners.

302
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:04,533
You're all guilty of sin.
You're all guilty
of not asking for forgiveness.

303
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:06,633
Oh, I know, I know,
I know. Here we go.

304
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,533
We skip into doopa‐doopa‐doo,

acting like he isn't even there,
he doesn't even matter.

306
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,233
Who cares about Jesus.

307
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:15,033
'Till somethin' goes wrong.
Till you're served the lemons.

308
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,233
And then suddenly it's,
"Oh, Jesus, help me.
I need you now.

309
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:19,600
"I can't remember
how to make lemonade.

310
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:22,033
I need your help, Jesus.
I've been bad and I'm scared
and I'm afraid.

311
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:23,600
"Where's my Jesus?
Help me Jesus."

312
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:26,200
Kind of mean.
Enticing. Step two?

313
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:29,066
Step two. Guilt blastin'
through prayer.

314
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,133
Five star.

315
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,200
So, this one, you wanna dig
a little bit deeper,

316
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:36,033
maybe crank everything up
to a eleven. Something...

317
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,866
Something a little like this.
See if you can follow.

318
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,033
Oh, Lord,

319
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,266
it's us again.

320
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,200
Stinky little sinners.
Human sacks of garbage!

321
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:46,066
Probably already
half way to hell.

322
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,733
You know the drill, Lord.

323
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:52,533
When everything's going bad,
we come running. When
everything's good, poof!

324
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:55,133
We act like your grace
is our birthright.

325
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,133
Which it is not!

326
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,100
Oh, I'm sure you're tired.
Lord, you must be exhausted!

327
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:02,966
You already went ahead
and died for our sins.

328
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,766
Then you went and brought
yourself back from the dead.

329
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,966
I'm tired
just thinking about it.

330
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,266
So you rest for a bit, Lord.
You rest.

331
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,666
And we, we'll just
keep doing
what we do best.

332
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,300
Paving our
own roads to hell.

333
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,566
You know the drill. Amen!

334
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
Bewitching.

335
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:19,933
Oh, what's step three?

336
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:22,233
Step three,
is the collection plate.

337
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:23,433
Wondrous.

338
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:27,000
Well, that's uh, pretty much
all sure about preachin'.

339
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:29,166
So, uh, what are
your three steps?

340
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,233
STEWART: Take this.
ROALD: Press play.

341
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,600
BOTH: And dance.

342
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:41,300
Are you meaning to do
the Bison medium well, or...

343
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,300
Sure you want that raw chicken
so close to the veggies, or...

344
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,266
BOTH GIRLS: Shut up!

345
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,400
TANIS: hey! Don't talk
to them like that.

346
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,000
Or what?
Or whatever the fuck
I want!

347
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:51,866
We hear you like
to bark.

348
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,100
But do you even bite?

349
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:57,000
Maybe if you spent less
time on your backs,
yous would know.

350
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:59,066
Or maybe if you
spent less time

351
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,033
selling cigarettes
to kids, you'd know.

352
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,533
TANIS: Uh hmm.

353
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:05,533
This ain't gonna last.
Yous ain't foolin' anyone.

354
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:08,066
Yes, it will.
(STAMMERS) Yeah, it will.

355
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,333
Start thinking
with your big brain
not your little brain.

356
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:12,000
They don't need you, Tanis.

357
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:14,466
Nobody does.
We've got them now.

358
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,300
There's a bit of char
on your grill, you gonna
scrape that off, or...

359
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,833
You gonna bump
that heat down or...

360
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:22,166
What's that?
Is that a little
trouble in paradise?

361
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,133
You never complained about
Auntie Tanis's cooking.
Just sayin'.

362
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,200
BOTH: Enough!
You tarts can't handle

363
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:29,833
a barbeque, let alone
handle your scandal.

364
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:31,500
I can see your
clammy hands
from here.

365
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:32,966
Do not say that word.

366
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,433
I hate that word.

367
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:36,066
Which one?
DAN: Oh...

368
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,700
ALL: Clammy!

369
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,333
Let's just pump the brakes
and quick fuckin' sec here
your friends in clamellia.

370
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:42,200
Let's get to
the clam‐meat
and potatoes of it.

371
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:43,900
What'd, you never listen
to Clammy Davis Junior?
What's up?

372
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:47,533
Clammy Hagar's the superior
Val Halen vocalist. I don't
care what anyone else says.

373
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:49,933
Clammy Sosa use to hit
them big dingers.

374
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:51,933
What, you never listen
to Clammy Wynette?
What's the problem?

375
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:53,333
Shut up!
Nuff talkin'.

376
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,533
Nuff chin waggin'.

377
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:58,066
Which one of yous
called my sister
a skank?

378
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:04,066
Oh, there's not much
I can do about
this one, kiddo.

379
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,400
It's all right, boo.
I got her.

380
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:07,733
Fuck sake.
When's the next
scrap comin'?

381
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:10,033
Starting to think
it's never gonna
fuckin' come, fuck.

382
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:12,000
AXE: You gonna give
those nuggets
a flip soon, or...

383
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:13,433
Want me to do it, or...

384
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:15,366
BOTH: For fuck sakes.

Hi, Katy.
Hi, Katy‐Kat.

387
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,966
Pete and repeat. Ola.

388
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,066
So, uh, we were just,
we were just wondering...

389
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,066
Like we're partners.
Kind of.

390
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,900
Um, and we work
well really together

391
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:30,266
So like, we were
wondering if...

392
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
If I would date both
of you again.

393
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,700
REILLY: Actually, yes.
Yeah.

394
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:38,266
The truth is, guys,
I don't really want
to date either of you.

395
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,533
It's just not really
the right time.

396
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:41,900
BOTH BOYS: Oh.

397
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:44,466
And now it's just
you guys, so,

398
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,966
think of all the snipes.

BOTH BOYS: Hmm.
Big city slams.

400

BOTH: Oooh.

401
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,900
Wheel, snipe, celly boys.

BOTH: Dirty fuckin' dangles,
boys!

So...

404
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,866
you still prefer pussy
over a meal made
by Auntie Tanis?

BOTH: They don't
need you, anymore.

406

You know what I heard.

407
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,900
You guys aren't the only ones
in there. Better watch out
for that yeast.

408
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,833
Do not say that word.

No.

Yeastbound and Down

You look more suited
to the Witches of Yeastwick.

Oh, I think, Glen
has the rips.

Yes?

Did any of those rips
survive?

Oh, sure. All of them.
I didn't touch it.

But how did you...
The power of Christ
compels me, Stewart.

No.

not a sin.

God a try for a day.

No.

00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,166
No. What did you say?

460
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,333
Chicken's dry.
I can hardly
swallow it.

461
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:11,900
You want it
to be a bit moist.

462
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:14,066
Argh. Don't say that word.

463
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,900
What word?
Oh.

464
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:17,700
ALL: Moist.

465
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:19,933
What? You've never watched
<i>Mickey and Minnie Moist</i>

466
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,600
growing up? You outta
your fuckin' mind?

Ronald Moist Donald.

468
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:25,333
Seein' my buddy Ben
on Moisture Chefs Canadas?

469
00:18:25,366 --> 00:18:27,566
No. But I'm all caught up
on How to Moist a Murder.

470
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,866
Fuck those Avery's really
put their foots in it now, eh?

471
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
My favorite show
is America's Moist Wanted.

472
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:34,600
You gotta respect
athleticisms,
Connor Moist‐Gregor,

473
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:36,600
Conner Moist‐David,
Floyd Moist‐Weather.

474
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:38,366
Boy, they're all
at the top of their classes.

475
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,833
They're all driving
Moist‐eradis, that's
all I know.

476
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:44,033
May even a Rolls Moist.
Or maybe a Moist‐cedes Benz.

477
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:46,600
No Moist‐subishis
eclipses in this bunch.

478
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:48,866
They're not using
Capital One Moister‐Cards.

479
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,466
Nope. They got
Amex Black likely.

480
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,433
Moist money,
moist problems.
You're bum scum, bud.

Sled Ted?

482
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:06,233
Rat Ass?

483
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:09,466
Jivin' fuckin' Pete.

484
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:13,833
They've assembled
the Degen All‐Stars.

485
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:16,066
Their organization
is baffling.

486
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,400
The fuck's your name
anyway, bud?

487
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:21,466
Alistair Orson Westwood Yates.
Baffling.

488
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,400
My name is...
Shut the fuck up.

489
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,566
Let's see you back
it up now, bitch.

490
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,000
Tanis!

491
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:31,533
We're gonna get
our asses kicked.

492
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:33,966
KATY: Not our pig,
not our farm, boys.

493
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,200
Yous don't need me
anymore, remember?

494
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:39,433
I, uh, have kind of been
wondering when the next
scrap is coming. Oh, fuck.

495
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:41,433
Wait for it.

496
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:51,200
We're so sorry, Auntie.
We wanna come back.

497
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,466
We miss you, Tanis.
You took care of us.

498
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,200
We promise, we'll never get
blinded by the pussy again.

499
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:58,600
We'll swear off
the pussy
for two weeks.

500
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:00,566
See what happened here
today, ladies.

501
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,800
The way to a man's heart
ain' through his zipper.

502
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:07,066
Tanis.
Hmm?

503
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:09,900
Let's have a scrap.

504
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:12,233
About fuckin' time.
I started to think
it was never gonna come.

506

Hmm, this is ever good
there, Auntie.

507
00:21:57,766 --> 00:21:59,066
I know.

508
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,500
Thanks, Tanis.

509
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:04,200
Auntie Tanis
always takes care
of her cubs, way‐hey!

510
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,200
I was a bit worried
when we were cooking
the raw chicken

511
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:08,466
so close to the veg, but...
WAYNE: Axe!

512
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
I fuckin' hate that word.

513
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:13,700
DARYL: What word?
Oh.

514
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:16,266
BOTH GIRLS: Veg.
Let me talk you of
the vedge, big brother.

515
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,266
I guess we're not gonna
vedge allegiance to
the flag then, eh?

516
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,500
Have a dart?
Have a Benson and Vedges.

517

Oh, you don't like
Peter Gabriel? That

Aerosmith,
Living on the Vedge.

Heath Vedger.
JONESY: Vegendary.

522

You didn't like Edie Vedge‐Wick?
That fucker married Kevin Bacon.

523
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:34,466
No, no, no, no, no.
That was Keira Vedgewick.

524
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,366
Edie Vedge‐Wick
was Warhol's girl.

525
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,500
Well, I happen to know
for a fact that Dan has

526
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:41,233
a full vedge boner
for any Vedge‐wick.

Well, I don't think you're
going to get a word
in here, vegde‐wish good buddy.

531

Prepare the Vegiment.

Take them veg or alive.

00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,266
Vegiment!

534
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,700
