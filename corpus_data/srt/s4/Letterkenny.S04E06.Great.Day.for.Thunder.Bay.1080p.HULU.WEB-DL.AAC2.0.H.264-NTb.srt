1
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:12,466
You were trying to figure out
WTF.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,100
with your BFFs
the other day...

3
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:19,100
‐You guys ever sexted?
‐No

4
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:20,333
All the times.

5
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:22,233
‐Do you really?
‐Daily.

6
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:23,966
I'm a bit surprised at you,
Squirrely Dan.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's all above water,
I assure's you.

8
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:29,033
I'm on a telephone application's
called Bumble.

9
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:30,533
It's kind of like Tinder

10
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:33,100
except only the women's
can initiate conversations.

11
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,300
So, what, they just message you

12
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,466
up on your telephone
to sex talk?

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,200
Sex text. Correct.

14
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:38,433
Terrific.

15
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:41,966
I think I've been sexting
with a gal, but not too sure.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, what did she sext ya?

17
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:44,233
LOL.

18
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:46,833
What did you sext her
directly before that?

19
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, I asked her if
she wanted to go on a date.

20
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:49,066
That's not sexting.

21
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,400
‐Sure's it is.
‐No, it isn't.

22
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,833
Dary asked a gal
to go on the date

23
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:53,266
and she texted back LOL's.

24
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,200
Yes, so it appears as though

25
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:55,900
that's what went down,
Squirrely Dan.

26
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:57,366
Well, that means,
"Lots of love".

27
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,000
‐No it doesn't.
‐Sure's it does.

28
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,900
No it doesn't. LOL means,
"Laughing out loud".

29
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:02,966
So?

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,300
So one of two things,
super chief.

31
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,400
Number A, she thinks
the very thought

32
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,233
of going
on a date with you is laughable.

33
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:09,933
Or number B, the fact that
you'd think

34
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:12,033
she'd want to go
on a date with you is laughable.

35
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:13,133
Either way you're hooped.

36
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,200
So?

37
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:15,433
So she's laughing at you, bud.

38
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:18,266
So it's...not sexting?

39
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,333
Figure it out.

40
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:21,133
Maybe she meant, "Lots of load".

41
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:23,533
You wanna know what?

42
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:25,600
That's the problem
with sexting

43
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:27,566
and texting
or technology in general.

44
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,433
The world needs less Facebook
and more face‐to‐face.

45
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,900
More than a bit
fuckin' embarrassing,

46
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:33,100
we're all sitting around here

47
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:34,833
trying decipher what
three letters might mean.

48
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sensing a bit
of hostility here, big shoots.

49
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:39,366
Wanna know how my Uncle Ed
met my Aunt Mary?

50
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,266
Walked right up to her,
like a sock hop.

51
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,600
Told her
he thought she was pretty.

52
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:45,200
Uncle Eddie's was a legend.

53
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,233
Aunt Marian, too.

54
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:48,266
Then he asked her if she
wanted to dance with him.

55
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,566
Like, if she wanted to twist.

56
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,966
I bet you he swing‐danced her.

57
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,166
(SNICKERING)
Before he ballroomed 'er.

58
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,433
And she walks over to her
gal pals and they're all saying,

59
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:56,233
"How about the balls
on this sailor.

60
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:59,133
Walks right up to a pretty girl
like you asking for a twist."

61
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,300
Of course they're all
green with envy

62
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,000
because no one's
asked them to twist.

63
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:03,600
That sounds like
Uncle Eddie's all right.

64
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:05,833
Yeah, sounds like par for
the course for Uncle Eddie.

65
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:08,866
Don't you think it ends there.
It doesn't.

66
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,333
Guess who walks into the
sock hop like he owns the place?

67
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:14,000
Elvis Presley.
King of rock 'n' roll.

68
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:14,966
Walks right up to Aunt Mary

69
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,233
and says he ain't nothin'
but a hound dog.

70
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,100
Oh. Tight spot
for Uncle Eddie's.

71
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:19,166
What did Uncle Eddie do?

72
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,400
Uncle Eddie? Walks right over

73
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,900
to the King of Rock 'n' Roll
and puts him on his ass.

74
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:24,966
‐Wow.
‐Uncle Eddie.

75
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,500
Next thing you know, in walks
the Rat Pack

76
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:28,066
with Chuck Berry
and the Beach Boys

77
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,266
who hadn't broken yet but were

78
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,433
making a name for themselves
as California street toughs.

79
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:33,600
Guess what...
all good buddies with Elvis.

80
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:35,600
‐No.
‐He's a goner. Gotta be.

81
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,066
Think again.

82
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,566
Uncle Eddie gets a tap
on his shoulder,

83
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,566
a voice says to him he says,
"Hey, kid. Need a hand?"

84
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,933
Guess who?

85
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,333
You ever heard of Johnny Cash?

86
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,000
Well, now
you're spinning's a yarn.

87
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,333
The Man In Black himself?

88
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:50,266
You better believe
it's the Man In Black.

89
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,300
He's with his good pals
John Wayne and James Brown

90
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,966
who don't take shit off anybody.

91
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,166
Everybody knows that.

92
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,233
You gonna throw hands
at James Brown,

93
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:58,233
I'm sorry you're a goner.
Everybody knows that.

94
00:02:58,266 --> 00:02:59,900
But they're still outnumbered.

95
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:01,533
So guess who shimmies over
in a real bad mood?

96
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:02,600
Who?

97
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:03,833
Little Richard. Gotta be.

98
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:06,200
Hey, you better fuckin' believe
it's Little Richard.

99
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:07,966
He's with his good pal
Bing Crosby.

100
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,333
That's Pre‐White Christmas

101
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:11,133
when he was still on
the bottle and a nasty drunk.

102
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,433
So you know it's on now.

103
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:15,200
Number one selling albums
of all‐times, <i>White Christmas.</i>

104
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:17,933
Uh, that's
Pre ‐White Christmas. Look out.

105
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:19,266
So fuckin' Buddy Holly
walks over

106
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,033
and Bertuzzi's
Uncle Eddie, right?

107
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,100
Next thing you know,

108
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,866
Ray Charles has got
Buddy Holly in a rear naked.

109
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,466
Buddy Holly's tappin',
Ray Charles says,

110
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,833
"No way.
It's not how this ends."

111
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:30,000
Cash is over there
arm‐barring Sinatra.

112
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:32,333
Sammy Davis Jr. switched sides
halfway through the fight,

113
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:34,233
he's got Dean Martin
in an Omoplata.

114
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:35,366
Well, where's Uncle Eddie?

115
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,300
Well, what's he gonna do?
He's gotta do something.

116
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,900
Uncle Eddie's
freshly transitioned

117
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:41,100
from a triangle choke
in favor of a full mount.

118
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,366
He's got Brian Wilson down

119
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,100
ready to serve the final blow
and someone catches his fist.

120
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:46,266
Guess who?

121
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,466
Johnny Cash.

122
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,933
Says, "Hey, kid.

123
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:51,566
We got this from here.
Go get your girl."

124
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:53,500
Uncle Eddie gets up,

125
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,133
John Wayne gives him
a tap on the butt

126
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,066
like they're old
locker room pals.

127
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,266
Well,
what's Aunt Marion's doing?

128
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,133
Did he go over to her?

129
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:03,100
Tell you what.
She went to him, okay.

130
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,600
He scoops her up in his arms,
fireman carries her out of there

131
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:07,066
to applause
from the sock hoppers

132
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,433
who clear a path for them.

133
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:09,600
Takes her for
a fuckin' milkshake.

134
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,366
Like a real man.

135
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,466
‐Wow.
‐Uncle Eddie.

136
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,266
So next time you're
thinking about texting a girl

137
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,266
to ask her out on a date,

138
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,566
I want you to stop and think.

139
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,300
About what?

140
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,366
About the glory
you're leaving on the table.

141
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:27,366
(PHONE BUZZING)

142
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:30,566
Hey, it's her.

143
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,800
Well, what she says?

144
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,500
(READING) New phone. Who this?

145
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,600
LOL.

146
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,533
(MUSIC PLAYING)

147
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,200
And that's why I never drink
out of Gino Reda's mug again.

148
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:59,100
These sheets are just jibber...

149
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,533
Oh, hi.
Welcome to Sports Centre.

150
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,166
I'm Dan, he's Jay.

151
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,333
Hello, Dan.

152
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:06,000
A homegrown feel‐good story
to round out the program.

153
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:08,600
Local hockey stars
Hudson and James Bay

154
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:10,200
return from a stint in Europe

155
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:14,100
to Letterkenny, Ontario...
to help their dad do hay.

156
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:16,366
Now what's not to like
about that?

157
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,966
Oh, boy.

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,366
‐Toolesy?
‐Yeah.

159
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,900
Letterkenny, Ontario.

160
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:24,133
‐Problem, Toolesy?
‐No. No problem.

161
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,200
Letterkenny, Ontario.

162
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:27,866
Home of local hockey stars
Hudson and James Bay.

163
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,566
Yeah. Yeah. You ever been
to Letterkenny, Jay?

164
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,833
I've not had the pleasure, no.

165
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:34,466
As you're aware by now,
I'm from Peterborough, Ontario.

166
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,900
‐Yes, I'm aware.
‐Okay.

167
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:37,066
You're familiar
with brawls in hockey.

168
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,233
Yes, I'm familiar.

169
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:39,366
Yeah,
they happen all the time.

170
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,100
How about brawls in curling?

171
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,166
That's a new one!

172
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,266
Okay, that's what happened when

173
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,133
Letterkenny's curling team
came to Peterborough.

174
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,466
‐A curling brawl?
‐Yeah.

175
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,600
A brawl at a curling match.

176
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:49,100
You ever heard of
a cribbage brawl?

177
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:50,033
More new territory...

178
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,400
Yeah,
that's what happened routinely

179
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,933
when members
of the Letterkenny Legion

180
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:55,166
came and played
cribbage tournaments

181
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,966
against members
of the Peterborough Legion.

182
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,133
A cribbage brawl?

183
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,966
Yeah. A brawl
at a cribbage tournament.

184
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,266
Toolesy...

185
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,333
You think I'm making
this crap up?

186
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:04,866
So what are you
sayin' here, Toolesy?

187
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,400
Okay, just if I were Hudson
and James Bay...

188
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,266
Home to do hay.

189
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,866
Yeah, yeah.
I'd be staying in Europe.

190
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,066
Are you ready for this
old goat to make your day?

191
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,333
Okay.

192
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:21,500
Guess who's coming
to visit us this weekend?

193
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,133
‐No way.
‐Way.

194
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,066
‐No way. For hay?
‐For hay.

195
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,100
‐No way.
‐All the way.

196
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:29,933
‐Who did they say?
‐Well, they didn't, did they?

197
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, not yet anyway.

198
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:32,166
So go ahead and say.

199
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,066
James and Hudson.

200
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,300
‐Bay?
‐Bay.

201
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,933
James and Hudson Bay.

202
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:38,433
‐No way.
‐Way.

203
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:39,933
‐Home to stay?
‐Just for hay.

204
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,066
You don't say.

205
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,900
Well, you know, a little bit
of work,

206
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:44,500
‐little bit of play.
‐Hooray.

207
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:46,366
James and Hudson Bay.

208
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,833
Hicks all the way.

209
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,233
ALL: All the way.

210
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:50,233
Oh, look. There's a stray.

211
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:54,566
Those guys are LOL.
Legends of Letterkenny.

212
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,900
Good workers, too.

213
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:56,866
Well, they're great workers.

214
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,266
They put away bales
with the best of them.

215
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,866
Faster than a fox over a fence.

216
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,500
James and Hudson Bay.

217
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:02,600
You wanna know what?

218
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:04,333
The brothers Bay home for hay

219
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,200
is a chance for all of us
to come together

220
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:09,200
and show 'em we're proud
in our own special way.

221
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:10,966
So, stick with tradition?

222
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Well, you don't
fuck with tradition.

223
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,400
Puppers and a pig roast
for the brothers Bay.

224
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,633
Puppers and a pig.

225
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,300
All right well, I'm gonna go
talk to Tanis about the pig.

226
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,933
You get them
cheapest on the Rez.

227
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:20,233
Okay, Katy. Okay.

228
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:21,333

231
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:26,266
But what are we gonna
call the party this year?

232
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,900
‐Hay Days.
‐No.

233
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:29,900
‐A Bay in the Life.
‐We're gettin' warmer.

234
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,966
‐Baywatch.
‐Almost there.

235
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,033
Wait!
Great day for Bay.

236
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:36,466
‐Yes.
‐Yeah.

237
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,600
Yup.

238
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:40,100
ALL: Great Day for Bay.

239
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:42,233
Will somebody help me
get that fuckin' stray?

240
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:44,466
Oh, shit, it's gettin' away.

241
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,933
Come on, yous two,
he just wants to play.

242
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,833
Fuckin' beauties, boys.

243
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:50,100
Beauties and beasts.

244
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:51,200
The Brothers Bay.

245
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,933
James and Hudson Bay.
Hockey players all the way.

246

in points,
PIMS and plus/minus.

249
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:00,866
Now they're playing in Europe.

250
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,400
Imagine all the Amserdamsels

251
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:04,600
Be wheelin' abroad all right.

00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,933
International ass.

253
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:07,033
Getting their ass ports stamped.

254
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:09,233
Oh, they're part of
the European Poonion now, buddy.

255
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:10,600
Traveling through
Titaly for sure.

256
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:12,333
Seeing all kind of Vati‐cans.

257
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,166
Nice mountains

Hammerin' all the Croati‐ass.

All the way.
Droppin' mitts and suckin' tits.

264
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:29,266

‐Home this weekend, buddy.
‐Home this weekend, bro.

266
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:32,900
Gotta do something epic.

267
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,266
How are we going to top All Bay,
All Night from last year?

268
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Fuck! That drew more box
than an architect.

269
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,433
They'll come up with something.

270
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:41,000
Where there's a will
there's a Bay.

271
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,533
Europe! Europe!

272
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,133
Bay Brothers.
Egotistical egotesticles.

273
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,433
Stewart! They're your family.

274
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:51,933
‐Questionable.
‐Undeniable.

275
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,133
Unverifiable.

276
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,466
Stewart, they're your cousins.

277
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,966
There's pictures of you
and the Bays

278
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
together as kids
all over your house.

279
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:59,100
‐My mum's house.
‐Well, you still live there.

280
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:00,533
Roald...

281
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:03,200
Stewart...it is verifiable.

282
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:06,833
This is not a Bay Pride parade.

283
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:09,566
Those Baystards never wanted
to hang out with me anyway.

284
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,233
I'm nauseated by their
hokey hockey hickey shit.

285
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:16,333
I do not want to spend more time
down by the Bay.

286
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:18,133
‐Where the watermelons...
‐Grow up!

287
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:25,200
Hi. What's your name?

00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:26,966

Present.

291
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:34,033
We're having a Bay‐B‐Q
this weekend,

292
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:36,100
'cause the Bay brothers Bay
are coming home.

293
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:38,266
James and Hudson.
Do you know them?

294
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,933
‐We're second cousins.
‐Oh.

295
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:41,433
Their uncle Cal
married my Aunt Sue.

296
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:42,600
Oh, which one's a Bay?

297
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,533
Aunt Sue was a Bay
before she was a Casa.

298
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,466
So now she's Sue Casa?

299
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,933
Married Calvin Garfield Casa.
Goes by Cal Gary.

300
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,600
You might know their kids,
Sam and Ella.

301
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:55,066
Salmonella?

302
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,333
Yeah, Sam and Ella
have a half‐brother Ty, as well.

303
00:09:57,866 --> 00:09:59,333
Ty Casa.

304
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,900
I said half‐brother.
His last name's Food.

305
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:02,933
Ty Food?

306
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,500
Present.

307
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:05,833
Jesus.

308
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,066
What's your name?

00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:08,400
Katy.

310
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:09,333
Katy what?

311
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:12,433
Wait...you know my half brother,
Ash, right?

312
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:14,900
‐Ash who?
‐Wednesday.

313
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:17,200
‐Ash Wednesday?
‐Mm‐Hmm, that's him.

314
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,366
Hangs out with the Books.

315
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,166
‐The Books?
‐Art and Mac.

316
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,466
‐Art Book and Mac Book?
‐Yeah.

317
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,333
Know them?

318
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:26,833
Are you fucking with me?

319
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:28,833
No!

320
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:31,966
Zack Russell Terrier and Ty Food
ain't fuckin' with you.

321
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
What's with the pig?

322
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,866
The brothers Bay
are coming home this weekend,

323
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,866
so Saturday we're going
to Bay Bash. Big Bay‐B‐Q.

324
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,133
Oh, yeah? What's it called?

325
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,066
Great Day for Bay.

326
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,533
Nice.
Points for Bay Bash as well.

327
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:46,933
It's too bad, though.

328
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:48,066
What's too bad?

329
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,033
Well, the Bay Brothers

330
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,900
are coming to the Rez
on Saturday for a party.

331
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,500
They're part native all the way.

332
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:54,966
But, Great Day for Bay.

333
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,033
Yeah but, we already got
$1,000 on fireworks.

334
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:01,100
Thunder Bay. Saturday. Hmm?

335
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:06,400
Hey, Zack Russell Terrier
and Ty Food are going to come.

336
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,933
Maybe you'll come, too.

337
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,533
‐Hey.
‐That's barley.

338
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:23,166
‐Okay.
‐How are you now?

339
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,933
You should stand down
on Great Day for Bay.

340
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,466
What?

341
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,000
The Bay Brothers are coming
to the Rez for Thunder Bay.

342
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,166
They're part native all the way.

343
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,900
They're full hick all the way.

344
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:33,066
Plus we already purchased
the pig from your people.

345
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,400
Yeah, but do you's
even know how to cook it?

346
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:36,066
Throw it on a spit and rotate.

347
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,266
Don't threaten me
with a good time.

348
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,466
Okay.

349
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,233
What about when you insert
the thermometer

350
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,933
to check
the temperature inside?

351
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:44,333
‐What about it?
‐I don't know. You tell me.

352
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:46,233
Here's the scoop.
We've already planned the party.

353
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:48,533
Yeah, but we've already spent
$1,000 on fireworks.

354
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,066
I don't want to see that
go up in smoke.

355
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,400
‐Up?
‐(SHRUGGING)

356
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:52,666
‐What?
‐Nothing. Go ahead.

357
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,833
Keeping in mind that you once
burnt down the produce stand,

358
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:56,533
a lot has happened since then.

359
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,866
The Brothers Bay home for hay
is the perfect opportunity

360
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,333
for all of us to come together
and show them we're proud.

361
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:05,300
So, we would like to invite
you and your friends here

362
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,233
for Great Day for Bay.

363
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:10,233
Or you can move your party
to the Rez for Thunder Bay.

364
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:13,066
'Cause the Bay Brothers
are part native...all the way.

365
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,300
They're full hick...
All the way.

366
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,266
So...

367
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:22,566
You trying to sneak a sunrise
past a rooster, Tanis?

368
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,500
I don't know.
You're the one whose stuck
between a cock and hard place.

369
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:27,166
You a breast or thigh guy?

370
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,000
‐They're full hick.
‐Correct.

371
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:34,266
And only part native.

372
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,466
(SHRUGGING)
Splittin' hairs, but yeah.

373
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,200
‐So we host.
‐Fair.

374
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,400
But the name...

375
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,466
‐Great Day for...
‐Uh...

376
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,933
‐What?
‐What?

377
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:45,900
‐Nothing. You go.
‐How's this?

378
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,466
Great Day for Thunder Bay.

379
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,933
Great Day for Thunder Bay!

380
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:51,466
Puppers, pigs and pyrotechnics.

381
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,100
Puppers, pigs, pyrotechnics
and pepperettes.

382
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:54,133
Perfect.

383
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,200
‐See you there, Wayne or shine.
‐Good enough.

384
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:59,500
There'll be fireworks,
just like old times.

385
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,866
It's been a business doing
pleasure with you, Tanis.

386
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,833
So, what about
that elusive girl of yours?

387
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:06,133
She gonna show her face
for once?

388
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,333
None of your beeswax.

389
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,533
‐People are talkin' you know.
‐None of their beeswax.

390
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:10,900
Doesn't bother you?

391
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:15,100
Mind your beeswax, Tanis.

392
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:18,100
Hmm . Later, boo.

393
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,166
We tried to come up
with our own party

394
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,066
for the Bay Brothers, but...

395
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,933
You's are welcome
to come to our party.

396
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:35,233
Wanna know what?
The Brothers Bay home for hay

397
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:36,466
is a chance for all of us

398
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,033
to come together
and show 'em we're proud.

399
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,900
Yeah. We know. It was just...

400
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:43,366
Just that everyone keeps

401
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,066
coming up with cool names
for their Bay parties

402
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,833
and all we could come up with
was Bay There Delilah.

403
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:49,533
Bay Jude was a runner up.

404
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:51,400
And honorable mention,
Independence Bay.

405
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:52,400
Yeah,

406
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:54,466
Bay the Earth Stood Still
was also a contender.

407
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,000
Shout out to Glory Bays.

408
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:59,500
But,
credit where credit's due...

409
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:02,200
Great Day for Bay
cannot be beaten.

410
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:05,366
So, we'd love to come
to your Bay‐B‐Q.

411
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,866
We just told you
that you're invited.

412
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,500
Fuck, we just fuckin' said!

is a chance for all of us

We're invited.

418
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:19,133
‐Sick, boys.
‐Sick.

419
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,300
How can we help?

420
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,933
Well, I haven't heard
form the Brothers Bay all day

421
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:23,600
so safe to say
they're behind on hay.

422
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:25,133
You should head on over.

423
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,300
‐Lend us a hand.
‐Done.

424
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,400
Just like liftin' hockey bags,
right boys?

425
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,433
On par.

426
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:32,233
Lift with your legs
not your back, right boys?

427
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:33,433
Why don't you try both

428
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:34,966
and see which one
works out betters for ya?

429
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,333
You'll wanna throw on some pants

430
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:38,033
or else
you carve your legs all up.

431
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:39,866
Bring some fuckin' Puppers too.

Pitter patter.

‐Not gonna do the pants, man.
‐Yeah. Go get beer though.

you won't be coming here then.

to hang out with me anyway.

What does that mean?

448
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:26,066
The expression is,
"make them pay".

449
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,500
I replaced their last name
to be clever.

Oh. Oh yeah, I know.
That's super...super clever.

You try!

‐Ed Monton.

He's friends with my buddy Mike.

‐Check.

00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:55,866
Where's the Bays?

480
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,166
Well,
according to their parents...

481
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,500
‐George Ian?
‐Fanny's?

482
00:16:58,533 --> 00:16:59,700
George Ian Bay and Fanny Bay

483
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:02,066
said Hudson and James Bay
went into town for a meeting.

484
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,133
A meeting?

485
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,433
Well, according to
George Ian Bay.

486
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:05,500
Fanny Bay said she couldn't

487
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:07,600
get a hold of James
or Hudson Bay all afternoon.

488
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:08,733
You know what, buddy?

489
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:11,000
I haven't been able to get
a hold of Big City Slams

490
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:12,833
all afternoon either, buddy.

491
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,533
Hey, you boys seen
those two gym babes?

492
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,000
You know,
the two babes from the gym.

493
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:18,233
Are they here?

494
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:19,600
Don't think so boys.

495
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:21,833
Couldn't get a hold
of those babes all afternoon.

496
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,000
CROWD: It's them. It's them.

497
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:29,833
(CROWD CHEERING)

498
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:37,166
Well, Great Day for Thunder Bay,
fellows.

499
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,133
(CHEERING)

500
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,300
‐Welcome home.
‐Thanks Wayne.

501
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,566
‐Welcome home.
‐Thanks Wayne.

502
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,100
Brothers Bay home for hay
is a chance for us

503
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,033
to show you guys
how proud we are of you.

504
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:48,933
Thanks Katy.

505
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:51,466
You guys made it
all the way to Europe.

506
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,400
Welcome home, Hudson.
Got to tell us all about Europe.

507
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:56,500
Welcome home, James.
Got to tell us all about Europe.

508
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,800
We will. We will.

509
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:03,266
In keeping with tradition
as promised, Puppers and pig.

510
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,100
And pyrotechnics this year, too.

511
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:07,400
Welcome home, pussies.

512
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:08,433
‐Thanks, Tanis.
‐Thanks, Tanis.

513
00:18:08,466 --> 00:18:11,866
But say, what were you guys
doin' all day?

514
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,400
BOTH: We had a meeting.

515
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:16,066
Meeting?
Let's call a bay of pigs.

516
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,366
There's that gym babe.

517
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:20,166
There's that other gym babe.

518
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,000
More like Guantanamo Bay.

519
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:24,133
'Cause I didn't know whether
we were gonna get out alive.

520
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,566
Hey, it's Big City Slams.

521
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,300
Felt like I was on
Bays of Our Lives

522
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,900
'cause there were
so many storylines

523
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:33,400
going on all at once.

524
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,433
Big City Slams 2, boys.

525
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:37,533
I don't even know
what Bay it is.

526
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,333
ALL: Angie.

527
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:42,466
Never thought I'd be
into Bay sex.

528
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Thanks for
the Bay City Roll, boys.

529
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:47,000
I'll be your Bay‐once any day.

530
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:50,466
Well...

531
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,033
LOL.

532
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,533
(EVERYBODY LAUGHING)

533
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:58,066
Is Stewart here?

534
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,966
‐Hudson?
‐Stewart.

535
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
‐James.
‐Stewart.

536
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:06,933
Can we finally hang out?

537
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:08,033
Hang out?

538
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:10,233
Let's have a fuckin' Puppers.

539
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:12,333
I'd love a fucking Puppers.

540
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,366
I just always figured
you didn't want to.

541
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,566
You know, the whole
hicks versus skids thing.

542
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,833
They're hockey players
all the way, boys.

543
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:23,400
Part native
all the way, too, boys

544
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:25,166
‐We're family.
‐All the way.

545
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,000
You guys do rips?

546
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,000
BOTH: Hard no.

547
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:32,400
‐But do you rip Chel?
‐'Cause we will rip Chel...

548
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:34,433
‐Oh, Stewart.
‐Goddamn right I rip Chel.

549
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,600
‐You guys got rips?
‐We got rips.

550
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,200
They'll do rips.

551
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:40,600
‐No rips.
‐But we'll rip Chel, boys.

552
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:42,833
Are you boys talking about what
I think you're talking about?

553
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:44,600
‐What if we are?
‐I'm calling the cops.

554
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:48,166
ALL: No...

555
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,933
Just kidding. Do some rips.

556
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:51,533
We're gonna need more rips.

557
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,533
‐I got rips.
‐Then it's on. Chel.

558
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,533
You god damn right, it's on.

559
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:58,866
‐Chel.
‐In rips.

560
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,433
‐Chel.
‐In rips!

561
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,466
(ALL CHANTING)
Chel. In rips!

562
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,866
Chel. In rips!

563
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,033
Chel. In rips!

564
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

566
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,900
Hats off to Tanis, boys.

567
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:31,066
She's certainly a great day
for Thunder Bay.

568
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,166
Tanis has out done's herself.
