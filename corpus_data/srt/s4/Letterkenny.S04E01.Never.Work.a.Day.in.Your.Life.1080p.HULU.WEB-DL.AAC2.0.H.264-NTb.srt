I'll give Rosie a call,

I asked the vet
if that sort of person
has two knuckles per finger.

320
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,233
One, two.
Okay? It's clinical.

she's in ship shape.

She's chiseled out of stone.

the healthiest German Shepherd
she's ever seen.

So then, what's the problem?

338
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:28,366

is that Stormy can't talk.

343
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:40,400
I bet if she could talk,
then she would
tell us what's wrong

so we could do something
