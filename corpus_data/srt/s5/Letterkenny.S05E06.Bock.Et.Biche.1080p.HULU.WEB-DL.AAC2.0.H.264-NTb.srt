1
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:13,900
You were sippin' suds
with your buds
the other day...

2
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:15,133
WAYNE: Hey, Dary,
real quick.

3
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,000
"Blank, lunch and dinner."

4
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:18,566
Breh‐fekst.
Oh, boy.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,966
Can I be honest
with you guys
for a sec?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,300
Oh, careful, Dary.

7
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,700
DAN: I'd suggest
everything you've said

8
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:23,900
up until now
has been a lie.

9
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:25,566
And you've said
lots of things.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,000
Like, when someone
starts a sentence

11
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:28,900
with "Don't take this
the wrong way..."

12
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:30,200
Guess what?
I already did.

13
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,833
Yeah, the same thing
if people start a sentence

14
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,766
by saying, "You're gonna
hate me for saying this..."

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,300
Guess what? I already do.

16
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,666
Or, when people
start a sentence
by saying,

17
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,900
"You're not gonna
wanna hear this..."

18
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:40,033
Guess what?
I already don't.

19
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:41,766
No, it's just
an observation.

20
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,100
Well I'm curious as to know
why you thought

21
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:44,933
it required a preface.

22
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:47,033
Well, because I'm aware
of how it might sound.

23
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:48,500
Quit beatin'
around the bush, Dary.

24
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:50,766
Yeah, Dary, I don't remember
you been such an
around‐the‐bush beater.

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,300
Oh, fine, now
I'm not even gonna say it.

26
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,866
ALL: Say it.

27
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,633
The only thing
worse than saying,

28
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,700
"You're not gonna
wanna hear this,"

29
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,800
is when someone says
they have something to say,

30
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,000
and they don't say it.

31
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:02,166
You're digging
your heels in like
a 12‐year‐old girl.

32
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
When in doubt, spit's it out.

33
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,500
Okay, fine,
I'm gonna say it.
Okay, here goes.

34
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,900
You know micro‐brewing?

35
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:12,833
Like, craft beer?

36
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:14,100
Yeah.

37
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:17,066
I always thought
it was "craft beard,"

38
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,600
on account of the guys
who make it always have beards.

39
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:23,233
So, it was all that
for just this then, eh?

40
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:26,200
Thank you for inviting us
into the circle of trust, Dary.

41
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:27,800
I believe the
preferred term is,

42
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:28,933
"lumbersexuals."

43
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:31,133
Well, "craft beard" makes
a pocket‐load more sense.

44
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,166
DAN: You know, craft beards
doesn't really bother me.

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,566
But it's the clever wordplay
that goes into
the naming of it

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,733
that I finds hard to swallow.

47
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:38,966
Like, "So hoppy together,"

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,066
or "Barley breathing."

49
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,800
Now, why don't you
just call them what it is?

50
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,300
It's fuckin' beer.
"Beer and headlights."

51
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,766
Yeah. I'll contribute.

52
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,033
"Ale by comparison."

53
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,066
Stout and about.

54
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,900
Sounds actually pretty good,
"Stout and about."

55
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:51,000
Stout and about's
not bad at all, actually.

56
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:52,233
I'd drink some
stout and about.

57
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:54,266
I'm surprised
we're not drinking a
stout and about right now.

58
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,833
I think what you wanna do is
you wanna put

59
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,166
an animal in the name
'cause people love animals.

60
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,033
Like, "Cute Koala Cream,"

61
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:01,933
or "Happy Hamster Honey."

62
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:03,566
No, no. What you wanna do is
you wanna put

63
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
a berry in the name
'cause people love berries.

64
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:08,533
"Partridge Berry Pilsner,"

65
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:10,733
or "Alderberry Ale."

66
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:12,833
Pleasing to the ears
and the mouth.

67
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,200
No, Dary.
Dary, no.

68
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:16,633
No, Dan. Dan, no.
No, Katy. Katy, no.

69
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,866
What you're exposed to do,

70
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,233
is put something
cozy in the names

71
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,966
'cuz people like
being cozy, right?

72
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,566
Like "toque" or "mittens."

73
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,166
And then, if you really wanna
double down on it,

74
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,800
you put something
outdoorsy in the name

75
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,533
because people love
being outdoors.

76
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:29,766
Like, "lake,"
or "mountains."

77
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,300
So what it's really
gonna boil down to

78
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,766
is "Toque Lake Brew co,"

79
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,100
or "Mountain Mittens
Alpine Ale."

80
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,933
"Blanket Fire Light."
There you go, Dary.

81
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:40,300
The other ways
to go is to use

82
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,800
a clever,
but ironical statement.

83
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,500
Like, "I'm bitters."

84
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,133
See, I'd go suggestive.

85
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,833
Like, "Slip‐it‐in cider."

86
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:50,500
Katy.

87
