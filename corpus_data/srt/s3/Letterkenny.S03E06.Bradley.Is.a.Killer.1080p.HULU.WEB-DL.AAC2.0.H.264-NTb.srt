You were havin' breakfast
with your pals the other day.

2
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:19,366
Fuck were youse
drunk last night.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,366
You know, I can't stand it
when you guys get really,

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,866
really, really drunk.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,066
‐Wasn't s'bad.
‐It was s'goddamn bad.

6

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,333

against everyone all night?

in the paper.

25

26

Well, Samuel's...

27
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:06,066
‐I fuckin' hate Samuel.
‐He's a Big Brother's now.

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,466
Oh, I fuckin' hate
Samuel so much.

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,100
Well, that's interesting,
maybe make Samuel

30
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:10,400
straighten up,
fly right there.

31
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:11,600
That's what I said.

32

Youse did pot today,
didn't ya's.

33
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:14,166
No.

34
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,266
'Cause youse are talkin'
like youse did pot.

35
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,933
‐Why?
‐Because that logic

36
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:19,433
is Titanic on the
ocean floor busted.

37
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:20,966
Why?

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,166
Well, it's like when
a celebrity gets all

39
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,933
fucked up on snooters
and such.

40
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:25,333
They think that the solution
to sortin' themselves out

41
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:27,433
is to get a puppy.

42
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:29,266
(CHUCKLES) What's wrong
with a puppy?

43
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, I'm just sayin', doesn't
it seem more appropriate

44
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:33,166
to sort yourself out before
bringing a beating heart

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,133
into your own home,
rather than relying on

46
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,833
that beating heart
to sort yourself out?

47
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:38,200
Snooters and such.

48
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:39,566
Uh, hmm, I had my go
with snooters and such.

49
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,400
Small town spawn
snooters and such.

50
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:43,166
KATY: Degens do
snooters and such.

51
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,066
‐Over and out.
‐I'd have to agree.

52
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,866
I think it's differents
for Samuel's,

53
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,033
he's just a six‐years‐old
with a penchants for mischief.

54
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,866
Someone needs to hit that kid.

55
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,933
I thinks for a six‐years‐old
introducing a little brother's

56
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:55,066
into the mix might just be
what he needs to inspires him

57
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,266
to sort's himself out.

58
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,966
I have to agree.

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
It's like Samuel who's
introducing a little brother

60
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:00,900
to himself to sort
himself out.

61
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:02,566
It's different than
like a celebrity

62
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,166
introducing a puppy

63
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,300
to sort himself out
after snooters and such.

64
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,266
And my cousin says
the baby is very smart.

65
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,266
‐Pump the brakes?
‐I'll soft pump.

What's the stupidest thing
you ever heard in your life?

67
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,466
I would like to say, but
it's impolite to talk politics

68
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,266
at the breakfast table.

69
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,966
I'd also likes to say but it's
impolite to talk religions

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,566
at the breakfast table.

71
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,533
Well, mine is neither politics
or religion so I will say,

72
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,866
the stupidest thing
I ever heard in my life,

73
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,600
is that a baby is smart.

74

Well, hold your horses
there, big shoots.

My Aunt Nancy works
at the nursery down

76
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:31,533
at the hospitals and she says

77
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:33,200
I was the smartest baby
she ever did see.

78
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,366
Your Aunt Nancy said that

79
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,433
I was destined
for constant confusion.

80
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:37,000

81
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,933
is stupids for saying
such things?

82
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:40,933
I love your Aunt Nancy.

83

90
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,900
Well, she says I was always

91
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,166
reachin' out for things
in my surroundings.

92
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,266
And that made you
a smart baby?

93
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,333
‐Allegedly's.
‐Okay, Dan.

94

00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:16,333
a baby who shows
signs of excitement

before it's able to verbally

103

communicate is a sign
of intelligence.

signs of stimulation.

Well, 'cause that means that
they're already getting

excited about
their surroundings.

Choice idea, Daryl.

162
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,000
Also go ahead and change
the name of my bar

163
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:49,166
from MoDean's 2 to Ostrich
Fuckers while I'm at it.

164

Crazier things have happened.

165
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:52,866
Besides I'm bringin'
in my own bouncer.

166
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,133
Oh, is he single?

167
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,433
You've had a busy
winter, Miss Katy.

168
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:56,833
Get after it.

169
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:58,433
‐Who's that?
‐My cousin Bradley.

170
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,800
ALL: Ah, Bradley!

171
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:05,866
I fuckin' love Bradley.

172
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,433
I love Bradley so much!

173
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,333
I'm one, I'd go as far as
to say I love him, too.

174
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:10,833
I love his pecs.

175
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:12,333
Nobody loves Bradley
more than Rosie.

176
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:14,066
Like, I'm not really one for,
like, being touched

177
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,200
or anything like that,
but then like,

178
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,266
he'll be huggin' you
and her huggin' me,

179
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,466
it'll be like a little
bit different. Like...

180
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,933
Well, like it's okay.

181
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,466
I'm his
second‐favorite cousin.

182
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,066
He's always saying,
"God bless you."

183
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,600
And, you know, I'm not
really a religious guy's,

184
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:29,100
but when he says it
you feel good, like...

185
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:30,333
Like I can feel the warmth.

186
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:32,200
Rosie's his favorite cousin.

187
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:33,433
And he does the best
impersonations, too.

188
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:34,900
Like so many of 'em.

189
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:36,166
Like he could do
it professionally.

190
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,933
He could do me professionally.

191
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,933
Hey, can't forget
about the low‐bones.

192
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,033
Oh, youse can's never forget's
about the low‐bones.

193
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:43,933
I hope this is
what I think it is.

194
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:45,600
What's low‐bones?

195
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:48,066
Well, low‐bones is basically

196
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,466
like if somebody's
saying something,

197
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,000
and you agree with them,

198
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:52,566
that means give
them low‐bones.

199
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,900
You can also use low‐bones
to say hellos or good‐byes.

200
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,400
Do you wanna know what?
Here's what low‐bones is,

201
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,200
I can tell you
what low‐bones is.

202
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:59,500
Low‐bones is when you hold
your knuckles below your waist

203
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,333
like this and bang knuckles
with somebody.

204
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:02,900
Except don't look the person
in the eye or in the knuckles

205
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:04,066
when you bang knuckles
with them.

206
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,600
Almost like you
don't give a care.

207
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,833
And then you say somethin'
positive under your breath

208
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:08,033
upon bangin' of the knuckles.

209
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:10,233
Like, uh,
"Hell yeah, fuck it."

210
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,333
Or, uh...

211
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,866
"Yeah, man, you rock."

212
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,500
Like, everybody get in
here for a second.

213
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:16,366
Just pretend, like, I just got
here and I'm gonna show you

214
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,600
what low‐bones are.

215
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,566
Hey, everyone,
I just got here.

216

‐You rock.
‐Fuck yeah.

217
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,466
Yeah, but 'cept you gotta

218
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,233
say it more under
your breath than that.

219
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:25,433
Like, everybody get in here,
pretend like I'm leaving.

Okay, guys,
I'm gonna leave now.

But we all know what the
best part about Bradley is.

224

Bradley is a fuckin' killer.

Oh, like, Bradley
will fuckin' kill you.

226
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:38,866
Like, Bradley knows his ways

around a head‐butts
and that's for GD sure.

Should be here any second.
