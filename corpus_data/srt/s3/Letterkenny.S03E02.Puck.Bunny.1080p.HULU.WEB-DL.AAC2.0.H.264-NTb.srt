00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,842
I already got
a fuckin' Puppers.

But if you don't
tuck in that lip,

00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:29,442
a bird's gonna come over here
and poop right on it.

10
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:30,742
What do I say about
talkin' too much, Dary?

11
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:32,242
The less you say now,

12
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:33,275
the less you have
to apologize for later.

13
00:00:33,308 --> 00:00:34,275
‐Good.
‐All I'm saying is,

14
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:35,608
if you're gonna be poopy,

15
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:36,942
maybe go try fishing
with somebody else.

16
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:38,675
What do I say
about the old boss, Dary?

17
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,342
Old boss is always a dick

‐Around food?

Okay, Dan. Dan, okay.

Let's do an exercise here.

73
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:26,875
You're in a car,
when's it okay to fart?

74
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,408
When you're alone.

75
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:30,708
One point for Dary.

76
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:32,408
It's always okay to fart
when you're alone,

77
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:33,775
but 'cept when
you're in elevators.

78
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:35,275
That's uncouth.

79
00:02:35,308 --> 00:02:37,308
You're trying to rob me
of my lifebloods here.

80
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:38,375
Or you can
roll down the window.

81
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,542
Another point for Dary.

82
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:40,775
But the car
must be traveling

83
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:42,542
a minimum of
60 kilometers an hour,

84
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:44,608
so that the fart may be
aggressively vacuumed out

85
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:46,308
before penetrating nostrils.

86

all I have going for me.

Hmm...

89
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:53,808
Well, safe to say,

90

if you have to ask
for permission

91
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,475
it's an inappropriate fart,

a half a point.

00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,128
Um, we need a favor.

323
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:39,394
‐Ferda.
‐Okay.

324
00:11:39,428 --> 00:11:40,528
There's a puck bunny.

325
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:41,994
So, the boys are getting laid.

326
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:43,328
A bad kind of puck bunny.

327
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:45,094
So, a lot of the boys
are getting laid.

328
00:11:45,128 --> 00:11:47,394
‐She's divided the room.
‐I bet she divides in a room.

329
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:49,294
And we want W's, so...

330
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:51,528
‐So, she's gotta go.
‐BOTH: Yes!

331
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:53,994
‐Players only meeting.
‐Yeah, we tried that.

332
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:55,928
‐Boys aren't really receptive.
‐Mmm.

333
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:57,461
She's a clever little bunny.

334
00:11:57,494 --> 00:12:00,128
We tried also talking
to her too, but...

335
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:02,861
‐She speaks puck bunny and...
‐(REILLY GROANS)

336
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:04,194
And what?

337
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:06,428
‐She drives us mental, boys.
‐We can't hang.

338
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:08,261
Like, girls who
don't play hockey

339
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,394
shouldn't talk like
hockey players, boys.

340
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:12,061
We fucking hate that.

341
00:12:12,094 --> 00:12:13,928
I should've packed
a lunch for this.

342
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:15,761
We need somebody
who speaks puck bunny.

343
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:19,261
We were hoping, you could
speak puck bunny to her.

344
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:20,361
For us.

345
00:12:20,394 --> 00:12:22,061
‐Ferda W's.
‐Ferda.

346
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:23,494
Okay, I used
to speak puck bunny.

347
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:24,861
Forgot most of it.

348
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:26,328
It's kind of one
of those languages

349
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:28,528
you need to really
immerse yourself in to master.

350
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:30,261
Let's see if I can
remember some.

351
00:12:30,294 --> 00:12:31,828
Don't judge my accent.

352
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:35,894
‐Sick mitts, bud.
‐Oh, that's good.

353
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:38,861
‐Mix in a water. Unreal.
‐That's really good.

354
00:12:38,894 --> 00:12:40,894
Wheel snipe, celly, boys.

355
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:44,228
BOTH:
Dirty fuckin' dangles, boys!

356
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:46,028
‐That's really good.
‐You nailed it.

357
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:48,794
(SIGHS)
Not my pig, not my farm.

358
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:50,528
Plus, this girl sounds
like she rolls.

359
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,928
I should meet her one day.
Adios.

360
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:55,261
Well, you have met her
already though.

361
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:57,428
‐I have?
‐Yeah, Angie.

362
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:00,994
The Angie?

363
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:04,394
BOTH: Yes.

364
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:06,794
In.

365
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:19,928
McMURRAY:
Look at this mess!

366
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:23,328
Look at all the dirty
butt‐filled cans.

367
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:24,828
Degenerates.

368
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:26,028
Bet that's not
your first dirty butt fill.

369
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:27,394
(LAUGHS)

370
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:29,894
(DAN FARTS)

371
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:32,828
‐Inappropriate.
‐Why?

372
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:34,961
Uh, Joint Boy's right
in the line of fire there.

373
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:37,061
Somebody likes some
Montreal steak spice

374
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:38,228
in their tomato soup.

375
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:39,994
‐Well, McMurray...
‐How're ya now?

376
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,228
‐Not so bad...
‐That's...

377
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:42,428
‐I'm good, and...
‐Well...

378
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:44,028
‐Are we gonna do...
‐Whatever...

379
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:45,494
‐So, every time...
‐Every time we do this...

380
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:46,928
We're gonna...

381
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:48,428
‐McMurray!
‐What?

382
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,428
Now, no one likes beatin' up
degens more than you,

383
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:51,928
so we figured
we'd give you a dang.

384
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,761
Tyson, Joint Boy,

385
00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:55,128
youse helped us
put up the shack,

386
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:56,761
so only makes sense
you help us defend it.

387
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,194
Now, they got us
on the weekend.

388
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:00,828
We should nip this
in the bud now,

389
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:02,494
before they get the rest
of Letterkenny.

390
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:04,294
Well, that's all fine
and dandy, Wayne,

391
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:05,928
but I had to hire a hand to do
the chores in my absence.

392
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:07,428
You'll have
to cover his wages.

393
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:09,961
Same. I'm on nights right now.
That's double time.

394
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:11,228
You should try EI.

395
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:13,128
Fuckin' degens
from up country.

396
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:15,428
It's costing us money to beat
the shit out of these degens.

397
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:17,861
Wells, if we wants to beats
the shits out of 'em so bad

398
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:20,161
that they nevers come backs,
we're gonna need these guys.

399
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,028
You know degens,
they always come back.

400
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,161
See, they're always
coming back, is the thing.

401
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:24,494
Pitter‐Patter.

402
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:29,228
Bought and paid for,
for fuck sake. Dary.

403
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:31,061
We're gonna advertise
a party for degens,

404
00:14:31,094 --> 00:14:33,794
egg huckers, nose pickers,
mailbox ruiners.

405
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:35,961
And what we're gonna do
is hide in degen blinds,

406
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:38,028
which are very similar
to deer blinds.

407
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:41,528
And we are gonna
put one right here.

408
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:48,294
And over there,
and there, and here.

409
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:49,361
And that way,
when the degens

410
00:14:49,394 --> 00:14:50,794
come rolling up
on their sleds,

411
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:51,961
we jump out
of those degen blinds,

412
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:53,494
and beat the shit
out of them.

413
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:55,094
Well, that's a good idea,
Dary, except it's Tuesday.

414
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,394
It sounds more like
a Friday night thing,

415
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,994
or even
a Saturday night thing,

416
00:14:58,028 --> 00:14:59,294
or even a Sunday thing
if you're squirrelly.

417
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:01,128
Can't forget, of course,
thirsty Thursdays.

418
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:02,394
It's fuckin' Tuesday.

419
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:04,094
I'd have a gagger right now.

420
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:06,361
Now, I'm no American
sniper style trouble‐shooter,

421
00:15:06,394 --> 00:15:08,828
but I'd say the next step
is to discuss a stronger lure

422
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:09,994
to get them out here.

423
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:11,761
Well, whats do degens loves?

424
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:15,761
Well, besides nose‐pickin',
pissin' outside, nothing.

425
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:17,228
Well, there are many things

426
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:19,194
that if you were to watch
the evening news,

427
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:20,494
you would stop
and say to yourself,

428
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:23,294
"What a fuckin' degenerate
son of a bitch."

429
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:25,828
I would say at the top of
the list would probably be...

430
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:28,494
Racists.

431
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,861
God damn right.
Racists is definitely degens.

432
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:32,228
That's right, big hoss.
Exactly.

433
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:34,494
So, here's what we could do.

434
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:37,228
Now, hear me out,
just hear me out.

435
00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:40,228
What we could do
is we advertise a party

436
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:42,828
for ethnicities
out here at the shack.

437
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:44,494
And we could use
the ethnicities to lure out

438
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,828
the degens that we wants
to beat the shits out of.

439
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:51,494
Fuck sakes, that's off‐sides.

440
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:53,361
Well, you didn't let me
finish, Boss Hogg.

441
00:15:53,394 --> 00:15:54,928
So, what we could do, okay,

442
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:57,528
is once we bring
the ethnicities out here,

443
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:59,961
we could beat up
the degens

444
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:03,261
before they could try
to beat up the ethnicities.

445
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:05,994
You're still walkin' a super
fine line there, big chief.

446
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:07,161
You didn't let me finish.

447
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:08,828
See, what we can do now,

448
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:13,461
is have the ethnicities
help us beat up the degens

449
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:16,428
like some kind of
fantasy revenge

450
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:18,994
of love of ass‐whooping.

451
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:20,894
I guess I've seen that
in a Quentin Tarantino film

452
00:16:20,928 --> 00:16:22,228
one or three times.

453
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:24,328
Abort.

454
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:26,394
There is that one thing
you see in the news

455
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:29,494
and immediately think,
"What a fuckin' degenerate."

456
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:31,794
‐Well, to be fair...
‐To be fair...

457
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:33,828
‐To be fair...
‐To be fair...

458
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:35,428
There's more than
a couple of things.

459
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,228
‐Homophobists.
‐Yeah.

460
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:39,761
Yeah, no. Homophobes
is definitely degens.

461
00:16:39,794 --> 00:16:40,928
You mean, like gay‐bashing.

462
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:42,394
‐That's the one.
‐That's the worst.

463
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:45,228
Yeah, you're right.
That is so gay.

464
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:47,361
Wait, that there
is homophobics.

465
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:49,228
Who is?

466
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:50,528
The less you say now,

467
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:51,461
the less you have
to apologize for later.

468
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:53,261
Good.

469
00:16:53,294 --> 00:16:55,028
You see, Professor Tricia
from my women's studies class

470
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:56,528
teaches us that homophobia

471
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:59,761
is not just condemning
homosexualitys,

472
00:16:59,794 --> 00:17:00,994
but it's also not using

473
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:02,494
the appropriate
and preferred terms

474
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:04,461
what homosexuals
likes to be called by.

475
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:06,928
Yeah, but they call themselves
twinks sometimes.

476
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:09,961
Like, I'd be offended by that.

477
00:17:09,994 --> 00:17:11,861
I might be offended
by that, too.

478
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:13,428
You see,
where I'm from,

479
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:15,061
sometimes when people think
things are dumb or stupid,

480
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:16,528
they just say that it's gay.

481
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:18,528
Yeah, but you're not exposed
to say that anymore.

482
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:20,028
Are you a homophobes?

483
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:21,794
No.

484
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:23,861
Well, 'cause what you said
was definitely homophobics.

485
00:17:23,894 --> 00:17:25,461
Fucks this is a lot of work.

486
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:27,394
Hmm. It's like pickin' stones
and doin' hay all at once.

487
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:29,061
Fuckin' degens.

488
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:31,294
I'm pretty sure
you're a homophobist.

489
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:34,261
I beat the shit out of you
one time for beating up a gay.

490
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:36,328
Yeah, I didn't know
he was gay.

491
00:17:36,361 --> 00:17:38,228
He called me a fag.

492
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:40,228
Well, this certainly
has come full circle.

493
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:41,861
Yeah, see,

494
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,494
but youse being offendeds
at being calleds a fag,

495
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:46,161
is also technically
homophobics.

496
00:17:46,194 --> 00:17:47,928
I'm gonna take
a fuckin' migraine here.

497
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:49,294
Well, see,
where I'm from...

498
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:50,994
We all knows where youse
comes from, McMurray,

499
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,394
but times
they are a changin'.

500
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:54,228
TYSON:
I think we can all agree here

501
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:57,928
that homophobists
are degenerates.

502
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:59,394
You call the rest
a misunderstanding.

503
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:01,094
Call it a fuckin' day here.

504
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:02,428
Ah, you had good intentions.

505
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:04,894
Well, wait,
just so I understand here,

506
00:18:04,928 --> 00:18:07,894
using gays
to lure degens out here

507
00:18:07,928 --> 00:18:10,294
is just as bad,
if not worse,

508
00:18:10,328 --> 00:18:13,361
than using ethnicities
to lure degens out here

509
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:14,761
that we wants
to beats the shit out of?

510
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,461
Christ sake.

511
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:18,128
And Tyson didn't even say

512
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:19,994
that the gays would help us
beat up the degens,

513
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:21,528
where the ethnicities would.

514
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:23,261
So, I think
it's obvious here, boys,

515
00:18:23,294 --> 00:18:25,961
my idea has a clear edge.

516
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:27,294
Mmm,
I think it's quite obvious

517
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:29,494
that using human lures
is pretty extreme.

518
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:31,828
I'd really likes for you
to meet Professor Tricia.

519
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,961
Okay, so using gays
is homophobic.

520
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:36,961
Tip of the iceberg, bud.

521
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:39,728
What about, fake gays?

522
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,361
Well, what's a fake gays?

523
00:18:42,394 --> 00:18:45,094
Well, someone
who may appear to be gay,

524
00:18:45,128 --> 00:18:47,294
but is not actually gay.

525
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:49,794
And therefore,
it would not be gay‐bashing.

526
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,394
Well, yes, you'd wanna avoid
a hate crime if you could.

527
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:55,928
So, you wants to use fake gays
to lures the degens?

528
00:18:58,261 --> 00:18:59,461
Perhaps.

529
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:01,061
DAN: Okay, listen.

530
00:19:01,094 --> 00:19:02,761
Just so long as everyone's
heard my messages

531
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:03,994
loud and clears...

532
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:06,461
I thinks
I can lives with that.

533
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:09,061
Okay. This has been very
diplomatic and rational.

534
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:10,961
I think the next step
in the order of business here,

535
00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:12,994
would be to go and find
some fake gays

536
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,794
for these degenerates
to beat up.

537
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:15,861
I know where to look.

538

‐A full roster?
‐No call‐ups, obviously.

Yeah, of course.

And not Reilly and Jonesy.

I'd never touch them.

Yeah?

you cheated on my brother?

‐Yeah.
‐And I went around town

Yeah.

637
00:23:44,113 --> 00:23:46,013
Yeah, the wheels are falling
off here, good buddy.

638
00:23:46,046 --> 00:23:47,613
Well, we needs
Tyson and McMurray,

639
00:23:47,646 --> 00:23:49,013
there's gonna be
a baker's dozen sleds

640
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:50,413
coming around the corner,

641
00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:52,480
and we are way the fucks
outnumbered.

642
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:54,080
Wanna know what?

643
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:56,513
All this work involved in
luring these degens out here,

644
00:23:56,546 --> 00:23:57,880
all these fuckin' chores...

645
00:23:57,913 --> 00:23:59,380
Fuckin' cold.

646
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:00,846
We bring these shirtless
nut sacs out here

647
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,380
to be fake gay dudes...

648
00:24:02,413 --> 00:24:03,746
I'm still not sure
how I feel about that.

649
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,313
Yeah, there's something wrong.

650
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:06,580
I don't know what it is,
or why, but there is.

651
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:07,746
It's not quite sexist,

652
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,446
but it's not
quite homophobist.

653
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,546
It's something though.
I know it is.

654
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,546
It's not PCs,
that's for damn sures.

655
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,346
I'm just thinking,
all this work luring them out,

656
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,013
wouldn't the more efficient
thing be to repel them?

657
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:21,880
That's a Texas‐sized 10‐4!

658
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:23,480
I'm farting!

659
00:24:23,513 --> 00:24:24,613
Appropriate!

660
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:25,813
Well, I could always stay

661
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:26,780
to just kick
the shit out of them

662
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:28,313
just 'cause they're here.

663
00:24:28,346 --> 00:24:29,080
And then I have to leave
right away, right after,

664
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:30,480
to get back to chorin'.

665
00:24:30,513 --> 00:24:31,646
Fuck! Same.

666
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,380
‐EI, boys.
‐WAYNE: Well, yeah.

667
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:34,846
Like, we're already out here.
We're already set up.

668
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,713
We'll beat the shit
out of them before chorin'.

669
00:24:36,746 --> 00:24:39,346
Well, maybe next time
we'll just try to repels them.

670
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,746
Well, that's what I'm saying.
Yeah.

671
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,480
Well, what could
we put out here

672
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:45,013
that would make sure that
nobody ever came out here

673
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:46,846
for anything ever?

674
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:50,613
I know where to look!

675
00:24:54,513 --> 00:24:56,546
(URINATING)

676
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,880
(PANTS ZIPPING)

677
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:24,646
It had to have been
a sick ostrich.

678
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,513
