00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:04,759
If asks you politelys to
stop this, would you do it?

159
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:08,526
Oh, you can have yellowfin
tunas, bluefin tunas.

160
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,026
I think tunas make
the best sashimis.

161
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:11,826
I thinks I'm having
a panics attack.

162
00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:14,226
Well, the Japanese call the
bluefin tunas maguro tunas,

163
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:15,659
those are kind of like the

164
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:16,992
default tunas
that they use in sushis.

165
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:18,526
Yeah, but toro is a
more expensive tuna but

166
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,759
it makes the best sashimis.

167
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:20,959
Oh, it's way better
than salmons.

168
00:07:20,992 --> 00:07:21,992
Hey!

169
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:25,926
When's... When's Katy's
gettin' back from the citys?

170
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,526
Oh, she'll come back
when she's good and ready.

171
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:28,859
She'll figure it out.

172
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:29,726
I figure she'll be back
for sledding season.

173
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,059
Oh, Katy loves sleddin'.

174

(SIGHS)

175
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:35,992
It chap your ass at all that

176
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:37,159
there's only one shack on the

177
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:38,192
shed trail through
Letterkenny?

178
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:39,192
Well, it doesn't chap my ass,

179
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,759
but I guess there could be

180
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,159
another stop along the
trail for a social.

181
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:43,692
Yeah, like it doesn't
chap my ass either,

182
00:07:43,726 --> 00:07:44,959
but I'm just sayin' that
sleddin' and socials

183
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:46,092
go together like
piss and a fart.

184
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:47,159
Yeah.

185
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:48,726
I guess there could be

186
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,226
another stop along the trail
for a social.

187
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:51,759
Could be another stop
along the trail for a dart.

188
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,526
Well, it's a great spot
for a darty‐party.

189
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:54,592
So, we're gonna build
a new shack?

190
00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:55,759
I'm surprised we're not

191
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:56,792
buildin' a new shack
right now.

192
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:58,626
That's what I'm sayin'.

193
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,226
I figure it's about time that
we stopped talkin' about it

194
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:01,892
‐and started bein' about it.
‐Oh, we could just throw up

195
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:03,526
the structure and get all the
materials paid off

196
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:05,726
‐sellin' two‐dollar cans.
‐Two‐dollar socials.

197
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,559
Yeah, we could sell
whitefish sashimis

198
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:08,859
to help expedite the process.

199
00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:10,692
Oh, we could get
real stinky and

200
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:12,459
sell perch and walleye sushis.

201
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,492
Hey!

202
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:16,592
Walleye...

203
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,959
Perch...

204
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:24,092
And whitefish...

205
00:08:26,192 --> 00:08:28,159
Are not...

206
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:34,959
Sushi or...

207
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:41,592

Well, yeah, I guess you'd
have to do pot

210
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,992
to accomplish
that sort of appetite.

211

Don Cherry's Rock 'Em
Sock 'Em 6.

216
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:02,792

game situation visualization?

217
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:04,992
Second Chel Tourney for
peak performance imagery.

218
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:07,059
‐Pre‐game dump?
‐No pre‐game dump.

Hmm. No pre‐game cruncher.

No pre‐game deucer.

Better go drop that bomb.

Better go release the
chocolate hostage.

223

Better bust a grumpy.

Better go

Well, I'd fuck with
8‐by‐10.

No, you're not playin' no
dodgeball in no 8‐by‐10s.

247
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,826
I never wanted to play no
dodgeball in no 8‐by‐10.

Oh, I got so much time

space heater here,
mini fridge here.

‐Boring.
‐Okay.

271
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:54,526
There's no money in it.

272
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,926
‐Way she goes.
‐A monkey could do it.

273
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,726
‐Good enough.
‐Missed sleddin' season, too.

274
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,092
I told you she'd miss
sleddin' season.

275
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:00,692
I was the one who said
she'd figure it out.

276
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:02,626
‐You figure it out.
‐You figure it out.

Where's your shits?

278

These are...

280
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:11,026
My friends.

281
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:13,492
Well, what are your
friends named?

282
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,726
Shep and Kingsley.

283
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,992
‐Those are dude's names?
‐Yeah.

284
00:12:19,026 --> 00:12:20,192
They sound like dog names.

285
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:21,859
I don't like
where this is goin'.

286
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:22,959
We'll be in my room.

Guys, hang up your coats.

288

Where's your
fuckin' shirt, Shep?

289
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:36,959
Where the fuck is
your shirt, Kingsley?

00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,192
'Cause I'm so fat.

293
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:43,959
Me too, I'm so fat.

294
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:45,126
I'm a bat fastard.

295

‐I'm a fat podger.
‐Guys...

Enough, let's go.

297
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:51,159
If I was a Dr. Seuss book
I'd be The Fat in the Hat.

298
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:53,792
If I was an arcade fighting
game I'd be Mortal Komfat.

299
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:55,459
If I was one of the
five boroughs in New York City

300
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:56,959
I'd be the Fatten Island.

301
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:58,792
If I was an Italian city‐state
I'd be the Fatican.

302
00:12:58,826 --> 00:12:59,959
Put a fuckin' shirt on!

303
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:12,759
I don't know what happened
to you dusters,

304
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:17,226
but, fuck me, do you fuck dog!

305
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,726
Walkin' around poutin' like

306
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,959
your little sister
took your last Oreo.

307
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:22,559
And not a traditional Oreo,

308
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:26,059
no, a limited edition Oreo,
or seasonal Oreo

309
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:28,926
they're gonna take off
the shelf for another year.

310
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,626
Hey, Barts,

311
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,926
did little Natiesha take
your last Halloween Oreo?

312
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,592
You didn't get a chance to say

313
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:40,092
goodbye to that
delicious orange frosting?

314
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:42,492
What about you, Yorkie? Huh?

315
00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:43,692
Did little Tamsyn take your

316
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:46,159
last Reese's
Peanut Butter Cup Oreo?

317
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,959
Well, it gets worse.

318
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:51,592
Those have been
discontinued forever.

319

What about you, Scholtzy, huh?

320
00:13:53,592 --> 00:13:54,892
Did little Tay'Rhonda

321
00:13:54,926 --> 00:13:57,592
take your last Ice Cream
Oreo Orange Sherbet?

322
00:13:57,626 --> 00:13:59,826
That is a summertime flavor.

323
00:13:59,859 --> 00:14:01,092
Good luck suckin' back on

324
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:03,459

00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,659
Little DeSondra
was the culprit.

329
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:13,559
And her pal LarawnShawn

330
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:17,092
took the last Heads or
Tails Mega Stuff, too!

331
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:20,159
Hey, Boomtown.
You're an only child.

332

NASCAR Daytona Oreos?

333

advice, donkeys.

Take a page out of
Jonesy and Reilly's book.

336
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,792
My boys, I skipped curfew call
for you last night 'cause

337
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:43,459
I knew you'd be doin' legs,

338
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:44,759
and I didn't want
to interrupt.

339
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:45,892
We've been doin' legs
two‐a‐days since

340
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,126
the first week
of summer, Coach.

341
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,526
Blocked every wheelchair ramp

342
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,459
in the arena so
we'd have to do stairs.

343
00:14:50,492 --> 00:14:51,959
Tenacity.

344
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,826
You can't teach that.

345
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,859
You know, I never thought
those pheasants

346
00:14:55,892 --> 00:15:01,959
would fuck the dog so hard

347
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:03,959
that you two would become
my studs!

348
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:05,159
‐Thanks, Coach.
‐Thanks, Coach.

What are you gonna do
to get me that?

352
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:14,692
‐Selfish hockey.
‐Selfish hockey.

353
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:17,226
That's right. Selfish hockey!

354
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:18,692
Break it down.

355
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:20,192
Skate the puck. Don't pass it.

356
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:21,692
Head man's still gonna be
there when you catch up.

357
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:23,226
Take it coast‐to‐coast.

358
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:25,126
Shots from poor angles
are still shots.

359
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,659
Buck and a half,
two‐minute shifts,

360
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,026
three minutes even.

361
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:29,226
Cruise the blue line
to catch your breath.

362
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:30,759
Bad bounce,
that's a good breakaway.

363

‐Gotta get the bounces, boys.
‐Perfect.

364

never hurt anyone.

they ask how many.

367

about stick tape?

worrying about puck handling

as much as the dog does.

00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:51,592
Well, are we
gonna christen it?

477
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:52,992
Should we christen it?

478
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:54,592
I feel like we should be
christening it.

479
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:55,992
Well, I'm surprised we're not
christening it right now.

480
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:06,259
‐Gordie Howe hat trick, ferda.
‐Game puck goes to Gordie.

481
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:08,126
Yeah. I had 18 shots
on net, boys.

482
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,326
Ovechkin numbers.

483
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,726
Played no less than
38 minutes.

484
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,426
Duncan Keith numbers.

485
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:15,492
But, uh, 9‐4 ferda.

486
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:17,559
Ferda other team.

487
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:20,026
You know, it's sick,
unreal stats.

488
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,559
But, uh...

489
00:21:21,592 --> 00:21:24,026
Be nice to have
a couple of W's, too.

490
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,426
Be nice to have "a" W.

491
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:28,092
Players only meeting?

492
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:29,459
Yeah. Coach is right,

493
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:31,392
I mean, no W's on the season
that's just...

494
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:34,092
‐Fucking embarrassing!
‐Coach.

495
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,126
Players only meeting.

496
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,059
Oh. Well, that's embarrassing.

497
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:47,692
Jesus.

498
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:50,559
All right you pheasants,
what's the problem?

499
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:51,992
Spill it, pheasys.

500
00:21:52,026 --> 00:21:54,126
My wife left me,
you little bitch!

501
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,492
Feels like someone ran
a coarse glove hustle

502
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:57,626
on my love muscle. Yorkie?

503
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,292
Same, Barts.
Feels like someone

504
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:02,026
fork‐gored my
pork sword. Scholtzy?

505
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,626
She's gone.

506
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,426
Feels like someone took
a big snackers on

507
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:08,659
my little knackers.
Pussy. Fisky.

508
00:22:09,526 --> 00:22:11,259
Out the door.

509
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:12,626
Feels like someone slammed
a super soccer kick into my

510
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:15,359
Ron‐Donny long schlong.
Boomtown!

511
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:17,392
I'm an only child,

512
00:22:17,426 --> 00:22:21,159
as Coach previously and
pitilessly pointed out.

513
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:24,726
I'd kill for a little
Natiesha, Tamsyn, Tay'Rhonda,

514
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:28,092
DeSondra,
LarawnShawn, in my life.

515
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:32,159
But someone did steal my last
NASCAR Daytona Oreo!

516
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,159
That wasn't funny!

517
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:37,159
But, you all love your wives.

518
00:22:37,192 --> 00:22:38,926
‐What happened, boys?
‐(DOOR OPENS)

519
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,026
‐BOTH: Angie?
‐Boys.

520
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:44,559
Unreal game.

521
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:47,559
Who wants to
take me out for a sando?

522
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:49,059
I'll let you work it out.

523
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:53,192
BOTH: Angie?

524
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:55,392
That's my girl,
you little bitch.

525
00:22:55,426 --> 00:22:57,526
She makes me want to rub
slick on my disco stick.

526
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,692
Yorkie?

527
00:22:58,726 --> 00:23:00,326
Correction, Barts. She's mine.

528
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,526
She makes me wanna go
Warcraft

529
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,126
all over my man shaft.
Scholtzy.

530
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,726
Mine.

531
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,026
She makes me wanna take a
low fiver to my deep‐V diver.

532
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,426
Pussy. Fisky?

533
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:13,259
Uh‐uh. She's mine.

534
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,959
She makes me wanna take a
fresh fruit to my flesh flute.

535
00:23:15,992 --> 00:23:17,159
Boomtown!

536
00:23:17,192 --> 00:23:19,059
You all have sisters.

537
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,326
I hope you're kind to them.

538
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:24,326
I hope you cherish them.

539
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:27,059
This one's mine!

540
00:23:27,692 --> 00:23:28,692
(GRUNTING)

541
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:31,426
This is bad, buddy.

542
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:33,459
This is really bad, buddy.

543
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:35,459
I think we've got...

544
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:36,592
BOTH: A puck bunny.

545
00:23:51,592 --> 00:23:52,959
DAN: It looks darker
out here

546
00:23:52,992 --> 00:23:54,192
than the inside of
a fuel tank.

547
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:55,426
Head towards
the sensor light, Dan.

548
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:03,992
I don't appreciates this.

549
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:07,559
Well, how we
gonna fuck this pig?

550
00:24:07,592 --> 00:24:09,459
We find who did it.

551
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,259
And we beat the
shit out of them.
