that guy fucking an ostrich?

fucked the ostrich.
No.

Allegedly.
Let's see...

210
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,433
It'd take more than one guy
to fuck an ostrich.

211

You think they were
both there?

to invite them, though.

You've attached messages
to each of your farts.

or you will have bad sex
for the rest of your life.

00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,846
Because I like
his farts?

309
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:07,912
Yes.

310
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:11,412
I'm just pushing a button.
It doesn't mean anything.

311
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:14,246
What the fuck
are you looking at,
you fuckin' pilon?

312
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:16,812
Fucking vampire...
Pipe down, idiots.

313
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:18,312
Get in the house.

314
00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:21,079
Now.

315
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:24,146
(GROWLS)
I'm gonna get you,
you fuckin' pheasant!

316
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:25,879
We're comin' phezzy!

317
00:15:25,912 --> 00:15:26,946
(CHUCKLES)
Guys.

318
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:31,012
Boy, you're havin'
quite a day, Super‐chief.

319
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:32,412
(SIGHS)

320
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:33,812
We've got
another problem.

321
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:37,146
Where's Glen?

322
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:42,146
Daryl, Rage Monkeys.
Daniel. Wayne.

323
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:44,812
We've summoned you
here today to talk to you
about your Fartbook profile.

324
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:47,046
Allons‐y.

325
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,446
You have no photos
and no farts

326
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:52,046
but are friends
with everyone along
for the test drive.

327
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,346
Hmm. I'm not friends
with everyone.

328
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:58,046
I'm not friends
with Wayne yet.
But I wanna be.

329
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,846
It seems as though
you were just cruising
through Fartbook

330
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,712
liking and commenting
on everyone's farts but
contributing nothing yourself.

331
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:07,279
(WHISPERS) Nothing.

332
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,279
I am as God made me.

333
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:13,812
Blessed with a very healthy
gastro‐intestinal system.

334
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:15,179
Not super farty.

335
00:16:15,212 --> 00:16:17,346
What you're doing
is called creeping.

336
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:19,212
Not what Fartbook
is all about.

337
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:20,979
I genuinely enjoy farts.

338
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:23,812
You can't just go around
creeping other people's farts.

339
00:16:23,846 --> 00:16:26,779
What the truck
is wrong with that?

340
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:29,679
If you continue
to misuse Fartbook,

341
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:31,679
we'll have to suspend
your membership.

342
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:33,946
Fine. Fine.

343
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:35,812
Fluff you then.

344
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:37,146
I have millions...

345
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:40,846
(CHUCKLES) And I mean,
millions of ways
of hearing unlimited farts.

346
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,379
We're done here, Glen.

347
00:16:43,146 --> 00:16:44,246
Are we though?

348
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:51,812
Are we?

349
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:02,379
I think we should
pump the brakes on Fartbook.

350
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:05,712
That's a Texas‐size 10‐4.
Why?

351
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:07,446
It's kicking up
too much dust.

352
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:10,746
We haven't even gotten into it
and already folks
are gettin' chapped asses.

353
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,012
Well, that's their problem.
Not ours.

354
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:15,246
This is our problem.

355
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,846
We started Fartbook so that
good folks could share farts
with other good folks.

356
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:20,079
That's it.

357
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:23,212
Not to creepin' farts,
or spam farts...

358
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:25,446
Although, if you eat spam,
you'll get good farts.

359
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:28,346
Farts should never come
between the love of a man
and a woman.

360
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:31,812
It's not right.
You don't get
to 500 million farts

361
00:17:31,846 --> 00:17:33,312
without making a few sharts.

362
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:35,212
Exactly.

363
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:37,746
So, what are you saying?

364
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:42,346
Fartbook dies today.

365
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:45,079
Today, Fartbook is dead.

366
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,212
Oh. You think so?

367
00:17:48,246 --> 00:17:50,046
I'm with the fellas
on this one.

368
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,712
It's not why
we invented it.
(SCOFFS)

369
00:17:53,312 --> 00:17:54,812
You invented it?
Our idea.

370
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:56,712
We built the site.

371
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:04,346
You know, you really
don't need a forensics team
to get to the bottom of this.

372
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:07,879
If you were
the inventors of Fartbook,
you'd have invented Fartbook.

373
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:10,246
Hold your horses there.
Let's put this to a vote.

374
00:18:11,912 --> 00:18:14,879
Those for closing down
Fartbook, raise your hands.

375
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:18,912
Those against?

376
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:23,779
But we own 30 percent.

377
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,812
This isn't fair!
(YELLING INDISTINCTLY)

378
00:18:27,812 --> 00:18:30,246
If you want
to sit on our backs
and call yourselves tall,

379
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,446
you have every right to do so.

380
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:35,412
But don't think that
we're gonna sit here and
enjoy listening to you lie.

381
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:37,279
You have a bit
of our attention,

382
00:18:37,312 --> 00:18:39,246
you have the smallest bit
of our attention.

383
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,912
When did we ask
for your attention?

384
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:42,979
The rest of our attention
is back at the offices
of Fartbook,

385
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:45,312
where my friends
and I are doing things
that no one on this farm,

386
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:47,012
especially and including
you idiots,

388

emotionally, or spiritually
capable of doing.

389
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:53,946
Have I adequately answered
your condescending question?

390
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:54,912
What question?

391
00:18:54,946 --> 00:18:57,112
(SCREAMS) Farts!

You better lawyer up, asshole,

393
00:18:59,746 --> 00:19:01,779
because I'm not
coming back
for 30 percent,

394
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:04,412
I'm coming back
for everything.

395
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,746
I...

396
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:10,779
I don't know
what happened just now.

DAN: You know, I've been
thinking about Fartbook...

400
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:31,679
What about it, bigshits?

401
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,212
DAN: I think maybe
we pulled the cord too quick
on that, you parachute.

402
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:37,012
I miss it too,

403
00:19:38,146 --> 00:19:39,812
I was on there a lot.

404
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,912
Too much, likely.

405
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:43,379
I was always checking it.

406
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:45,146
It was very addicting.

407
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:49,012
Except, did you ever really
stop to think about one thing,
did you?

408
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:51,279
Rippin' farts
into your computer
doesn't exactly

409
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:53,179
spike the likelihood
of having sex with girls.

Hey! Hey!

413
00:20:02,112 --> 00:20:05,146
Not now. Need 20 minutes.
STEWART: Okay.

414
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:07,012
Just wanted to let you know
that Glen stole our website.

415
00:20:08,112 --> 00:20:09,779
It's been live
for more than 36 hours.

Hey! Hey! Fuck it!

Oh! Fuck's sake.
Jesus!

Fucking sort
yourselves out.

GLEN: Cheese and rice.

420
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:49,079
I can't remember the last time
five men came in this church
so aggressively.

421
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:51,346
Or can I?

422
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:53,412
You stole our idea.
Hmm...

423
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:55,979
Are you referring
to Christian Fart Mingle?

424
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:57,246
What's that?

425
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:59,679
It's like Christian Mingle,
but for farts.

426
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:01,012
DARYL: We asked your help
with our idea

427
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:02,979
and you went behind our backs
and stole'd it.

428
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,446
(STUTTERING)
I didn't... Excuse...
Oh, my God.

429
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:10,279
Those are some hairy
allegations you are firing,
at my face.

430
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:13,746
All your allegations...
All of them, completely
fricken' false. Baseless.

431
00:21:14,112 --> 00:21:15,779
How?

432
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:17,979
Stewart, I did not
steal anything.

433
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:19,379
Because the last time
I checked,

434
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:22,679
taking advantage
of a growing trend
was not stealing.

435
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:24,846
What trend?
I'll tell you.

436
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:26,146
But first, let's sing a hymn.
No.

437
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:28,046
No.
Fine.

438
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,712
Look, y'all had
a good idea, all right?

439
00:21:30,746 --> 00:21:32,812
You had a terrific idea.
Congratulations.

440
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:36,841
But did you actually think
you were the only ones
in the world to have it?

441
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:40,907
What are you talking about?

442

I'm talking about
Fart culture, Stewart.
It's all the rage.

It's everywhere.

Glen will show you.

I've heard of Plenty of Fish.

It's very much like that,
except for farts.

449
00:21:59,507 --> 00:22:00,907
Here. Here's the one
I like the best.

450
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:03,474
It's called Fart Filter.

451
00:22:03,507 --> 00:22:06,574
And I like it because you can
put different filters on all
of your farts and it's fun.

452
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:07,907
So, yeah, I'll just
show you how it works.

453
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:10,007
This one, no filter. Nothing.

through the Hudson filter...

464
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,041
Now boys, because
I'm feeling generous,

465
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:45,007
and we're in the Lord's house,
I'm gonna play you

466
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,341
the filter that
I invented myself.
I call it...

467
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:50,907
Valencia.

Wow.

470
00:23:02,707 --> 00:23:05,074
There is a whole site
devoted to gluten‐free farts.

471
00:23:05,107 --> 00:23:07,841
The point is,
it's out there, boys.

472
00:23:07,874 --> 00:23:10,507
It's happened.
The idea lives in the world.

473
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,841
Y'all are too slow.
Slow on the uptake.

474
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:15,141
Sad story. Boo‐hoo. Toot‐toot!

475
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:16,641
Go away.
(HOARSELY) Let's go.

angry face.

(FART RECORDING PLAYING)

478
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,774
Better slow down there,
Big‐shoots.

479
00:23:30,807 --> 00:23:32,041
Tomorrow's gonna be
a great day for hay.

480
00:23:32,074 --> 00:23:35,807
If you can be a man at night,
you can be a man
in the morning.

481
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:37,441
Wayne, how come you
didn't join Fartbook?

482
00:23:37,474 --> 00:23:40,641
'Cause you're not supposed
to fart in front of girls.
What?

483
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:43,941
There's certain things that
should stay sacred between
a man and a woman.

484
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:46,974
So, all things considered,
this whole thing's
pretty fucking juvenile,

485
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:48,974
if I do say so myself.

486
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:51,107
If she's always listening
to your ass acoustics,

487
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:52,574
or even worse,
smellin' 'em,

488
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:56,041
I guarantee she'll be slower
and slower to crawl into bed
with you at night.

489
00:23:56,074 --> 00:23:58,541
What you just said
is outrageous.

490
00:23:58,574 --> 00:24:00,141
No it isn't. It's true.

491
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:02,974
I don't wanna be smelling
a dude's ass all the time.
Get real.

492
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:05,141
What are you?
Some kind of fart purist?

493
00:24:05,174 --> 00:24:07,407
So what are you
supposed to do?
Just hold it in?

494
00:24:07,441 --> 00:24:09,374
Or take a shit,
you fuckin' degenerate.

495
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:10,774
Speaking of shit,

496
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:12,774
my second cousin's got IBS.

497
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:14,774
Who, Garrett?
No, Jarett.

498
00:24:14,807 --> 00:24:18,907
DAN: No.
IBS, the International
Business Solution?

499
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:21,941
IBS stands for
Irritable Bowel Syndromes.

500
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:25,741
Anyhoo, when he was a kid,
Jackass comes out on the air,

501
00:24:25,774 --> 00:24:28,441
so it becomes real popular
in his high school,

502
00:24:28,474 --> 00:24:31,674
for kids to start taking shits
in places what weren't meant
for taking shits in.

503
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:33,074
They calls that
guerrilla shittin'.

504
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:34,741
Is this a true story?

505
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,874
So, he became real popular
with his friends,

506
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:40,474
with his ability to take
a shits any time he needed to.

507
00:24:40,507 --> 00:24:42,407
They'd call him up
when they get an idea

508
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:44,374
of a place that needed
a shits taken in,

509
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:46,874
and be like,
"Hey, why don't you comes
over here and takes a shits?"

510
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:49,707
Anyhow, this one time
his pal texts him up,

511
00:24:49,741 --> 00:24:52,807
and he says, "Hey,
why don't you come take a
shits in the girls' bathroom?"

512
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:55,007
So, he drinks a coffee,
eats a bran muffin,

513
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,841
heads on down
to the washroom there,

514
00:24:56,874 --> 00:24:58,874
but when he opens
the bathroom door,
what does he find?

515
00:24:58,907 --> 00:25:00,941
But this pretty young girl
just dropping a shits,

516
00:25:00,974 --> 00:25:02,841
right there
in the middle
of the bathroom floor.

517
00:25:02,874 --> 00:25:04,741
And that's how he met
his lovely Eunice.

518
00:25:04,774 --> 00:25:07,374
And they fells in love,
and they've been together
ever since.

519
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:09,907
They raised
three little shits. So...

520
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,674
With all due respect,
Miss Katy,

521
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:17,074
there is a market
for gentlemens what can find
ladies who like, uh, farts,

522
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:19,507
or shits,
or even guerrilla shittin's.

523
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:21,974
That is not a true story.

524
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:23,741
That is a true story.

525
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:25,907
God help us all.

526
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,674
You know what, I don't know
why you guys need everybody
knowing your business anyway.

527
00:25:29,707 --> 00:25:32,541
Like why you gotta put
everything on the internet,
while you're doing it,

528
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:33,907
or after you're done doing it?

529
00:25:33,941 --> 00:25:35,674
Well, if you don't puts it
on the internet,

530
00:25:35,707 --> 00:25:37,374
how's gonna people know
what you did?

531
00:25:37,407 --> 00:25:39,141
Do you wanna know what?
That's your problem
right there.

532
00:25:39,174 --> 00:25:41,741
Should be playing your cards
close to your chest.

533
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:44,041
Keep the ladies
guessin' a little bit.
Be the mystery man.

534
00:25:44,074 --> 00:25:45,607
Right again.

535
00:25:45,641 --> 00:25:47,907
Oh, if a woman's not gonna
love me for my farts

536
00:25:47,941 --> 00:25:50,674
or for me posting
my bowling scores
on the internet...

537
00:25:51,874 --> 00:25:53,541
Not really sure
I want one.

538
00:25:53,574 --> 00:25:55,841
Well, then it's a good thing
you's two have each other.

539
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,341
