1
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:12,466
A pack of coyotes
come right up the back porch
the other night,

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,133
'cause your dog's in heat
and you know those
fuckin' yellow eyed bastards

3
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:16,733
will go right through
the screen door
if they're horny.

4
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:17,766
(COCKS GUN)

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,666
Look like you're goin'
to a formal with that
top button done up to 11.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,500
Oh, it's not like I'm gonna
be one of those nut sacks,

7
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:27,700
sitting around
getting sucked on
by skeeters all day.

8
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:28,533
Come off it.

9
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:32,166
Well. Pitter patter.
Let's get at 'er.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,533
Sixty bucks per
dead coyote ain't
gonna collect itselfs.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,066
I think I'll have
a bumper dump
before we get started.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,466
Oh, I don't give a care.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,100
You ever had a bumper dump?

14
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,166
It's not polite
to talk about.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,433
Though I do gotta
piss goddamn bad.

16
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:47,300
When you have a dump,

17
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,600
leaning up against
the back of the bumper
of your machine.

18
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:50,600
So, it's pretty near
like it sounds then.

19
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,500
You ever have a stump hump?

20
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:54,200
You know,
I think I did, but...

21
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:56,433
I can't remember.

22
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:57,566
It's when you have sex...
With a girl?

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,033
Yeah, with a girl.

24
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:02,333
Bent over a stump of a tree.

25
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:06,266
My friend said he had sex
inside a hollowed log
one time and I thought,

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,700
"Why, I bet Fred Penner
pulled that off
one time, too."

27
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,066
This right here,
perfect stump
for a stump hump.

28
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,200
I should say.

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,533
Wayne?
Dary.

30
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,066
Come over here and
join me for a sec.

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,233
Oh, well fuckin'...

32
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:29,466
Like fuckin' why?

33
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:35,333
It appears somebody's
been growing marijuana
in your back bush.

34
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:37,366
You left the barn door open
after chores one time

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,200
and your dad thought
you were stoned.

36
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,233
But you haven't smoked
the electric lettuce
since grade eight.

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,700
That's a mitt full
of Johnny Red Eye,
all right.

38
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,700
I think it's only appropriate
we call the cops.

39
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:58,133
Just take about 20% off 'er
over there, mixed berry.

40
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,566
Don't be such a sally.

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,800
You know how much shit
needs doin' around here?

42
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,500
Well, shit needs
so much doin' really...

43
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,633
The produce stand
is a fuckin' shanty.

44
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,633
If we sell this stuff,
we can make thousands.

45
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,366
I know a guy
on the reserve.

46
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,166
I don't know.
Why not?

47
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,633
It's 'cause...
Just kidding.
We don't give a fuck.

48
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,133
KATY: If the cops come
around here, people will talk.

49
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,333
Don't want people talkin'.

50
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,133
Call your guy.

STEWART: Hello, Tanis.

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,300
TANIS: You know the deal.
Personal use only.

53
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,600
If I hear about yous
turning around
and selling them,

54
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:33,000
and I will hear about it,

55
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:35,666
we're gonna have
a hell of a problem.

56
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:38,466
TANIS: Here's your smokes.

57

You gonna be upset
if you keep scrolling
to the left, dog.

66

You gonna see some shit
that you don't wanna see.

67
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:24,066
This is a big crop.

68
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,300
Whoever planted it,

69
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,466
has done a lot
of sneaking around
and maintaining it so well.

70
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,266
We're busy enough
keeping the worm pickers
off the property.

71
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,733
There's nothing like
good outdoor grown.

72
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:40,566
It's 5k worth
and ready for harvesting.

73
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,733
You pull it out
of the ground,

74
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,233
I'll pick it up.

75

Should say estranged,
I suppose.

What's so stranged
about her?

I'll tell you,
if you find
yourselves in her way,

you oughtta
swiftly get out of it.

need to explain.

your dick hard,

about that later.

for you to say...

like big boys yet, huh?

Maybe pick out
your own outfits
in the morning?

104

I think about it, buddy.

were doing it with Carzy

still fucked up, bro?

are always with Carzy

No, no, no.
You hang on. All right?

157
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,300

And I'm fuckin' pissed.

158

But... (SIGHS)

159
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,033
We can make it right.
As un‐PC as this
market may be,

160
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:47,200
it's pretty lucrative, so...

161
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,600
If you sell the rest
of the cigarettes
at a buck a dart,

162
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,166
we get ninety cents,
you get ten.

Deal.
No! No deal.

165
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,666
I spent all our
money at that rave.

166
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,100
You're gonna step on some
toes in any business venture.
It's inevitable.

167
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:04,066
If we want to take
this meth business
to the next level,

168
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,133
we cannot part with
any more coin.

169

Are you with me?
Always.

170

you think this works?

You just take a beating
and then we're square?

177

312
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,927
Till it was my business.

313
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,460
Now, we could beat the fuck
outta yous right here.

314
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:19,060
And mark my words,
one day, we'll get ya.

315
00:15:19,093 --> 00:15:21,260
But that doesn't solve
our problem here. Dary.

316
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:26,360
Your name's Dary?

317
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,193
It's Daryl.

318
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:34,093
That's just something my
friends call me sometimes.

319
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:36,560
We gotta put the damage
you're doing around
Letterkenny to bed.

320
00:15:36,593 --> 00:15:38,393
That's 5k. What are
you's owed?

321
00:15:38,427 --> 00:15:39,993
(SCOFFS) More than that.

322
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:42,027
We're tough fuckin' sleddin'!
Hey.

323
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:46,293
We're gonna call it 5k.

324
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:48,093
Is that what we're gonna do?
We are.

325
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,193
You're gonna take it
and leave Letterkenny.

326
00:15:50,227 --> 00:15:52,527
And if yous come back for
so much as to pump your gas...

327
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,493
When he gives a warning,
he don't repeat it.

328
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:55,893
We'll get ya.

329
00:15:57,227 --> 00:15:58,493
Deal. (CLEARS THROAT)

330
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:04,227
Beats fighting
an ostrich fucker.

331
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,927
All right, can we, uh,
part the hick sea here?

332
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,860
Uh, actually wait.

333
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:15,993
I got to know.

334
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:18,127
This has gotta sting
a little bit, right?

335
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,893
(CHUCKLES) I mean,
you're short, you're ugly,

336
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:23,093
you're incompetent,
you're fuckin' broke!

337
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:24,027
Fuckin' A.

338
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,260
You're a fuckin' addict,
you're hopeless.

339
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:27,393
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

340
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:29,493
I mean you are
such a tragedy that

341
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:31,560
even all these people
here who hate you,

342
00:16:31,593 --> 00:16:33,860
will bail you out, just so

343
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,227
they can...

344
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,893
What's the word?
Erase you.

345
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:41,393
My cousin was born with
fetal alcohol syndrome and
he works at a fuckin' bank.

346
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:42,960
What's your fucking excuse?

347
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:44,060
That'll do, Tanis.

348
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:45,593
Hey! I'm not
talking to you.

349
00:16:47,193 --> 00:16:49,127
Look at you.

350
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,460
You got bloodshot eyes,
runny nose, fuckin' greasy
hair, scabs everywhere.

351
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:55,193
What is that?
What's that, right there?

352
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:57,593
You see that?
Is that cum? Dried cum
on your fuckin' zipper?

353
00:16:57,627 --> 00:16:59,093
(TANIS LAUGHING)
I'm so sorry.

354
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:02,227
(TANIS INHALES)
Oh, you are pointless.

355
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:06,393
I bet, the second
you popped out,

356
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:08,960
your mom wished she had
a sewn up snapper.

357
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:12,027
Probably would've been
better if you grew to a
sickly size inside the womb

358
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,960
and killed the both of you
before you fuckin' rolled out
and started fucking up.

359
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,193
KATE: Bitch.

360
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:19,127
(GROANS) What?

361
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,327
I'll tell you what's gotta
sting a little bit.
(TANIS SCOFFS)

362
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:23,860
(GROANS)

363
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:26,927
Well, fuckin'
get after it, then!

364
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,160
RILEY: Well, Who would've
'thunk it. Fuck.

365
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,493
JONESY: Mmm‐hmm.

366
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,327
That was a top tier
sucker, Riley.

367
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,327
DAN: You too, Jonesy.

368
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,593
Thanks boys. I'd sucker
you guys in your sleep.

369
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:41,127
Still... Makes my
top three suckers, boys.

370
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,627
An A‐1 box shot,
you fuckin' barbarian.

371
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,327
Never claimed to be a lady.

372
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,193
Did you stop and smoke a joint
for a bit and then jump
right back in there?

373
00:18:50,227 --> 00:18:51,560
Nectar of gods, fellas.

374
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:55,193
On the house.

375
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,027
All right! (CHEERING)

376
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:41,960
Well at this rate,
we'll need another one
soon, Gail.

377
00:19:41,993 --> 00:19:43,493
(BANGING)

378
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:56,027
You know, I gotta say,

379
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,460
I'm looking forward
to a bit of peace
and quiet around here.

380
00:19:58,493 --> 00:20:00,193
DAN: Hear, hear.

381
00:20:00,227 --> 00:20:02,127
There ain't no reason to
get excited, am I right?

382
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,360
Yup.
Yeah.

383
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,460
MAN: All right.

384
00:20:08,393 --> 00:20:10,227
Who the fuck is
the toughest guy in here?

385
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:16,360
That'd be me.

386
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,393
