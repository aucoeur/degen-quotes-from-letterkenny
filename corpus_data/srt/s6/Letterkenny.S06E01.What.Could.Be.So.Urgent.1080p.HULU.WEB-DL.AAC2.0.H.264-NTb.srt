00:00:10,153 --> 00:00:12,506
A fuckin' cross‐fitter
gave ya the stink‐eye

2
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,841
flippin' tires down the street
trying to look hard.

3
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,877
Buddy, you're softer
than a Cinnabon sampler.

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,612
You kiss your friend's
older sister once who

5
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:20,246
who tastes like
Fisherman's Friends

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,182
then you better do horn
to that memory ever since.

7
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:24,450
You woke up with your horn
looking out the window

8
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:26,186
but you gotta be
at work in 20.

9
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:27,287
So it's now or never.

10
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:29,489
Well, I should say.

11
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:31,625
We're all excited that the Leafs
are doing betters and all's.

12
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:33,293
But if they think's
you're payin' a buck‐twenty

13
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:35,461
for upper bowl seats,
they can suck my babcock.

14
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:37,731
You ripped a game of Buck Hunter
so fuckin' immaculate

15
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:40,133
that bar has brought you in
through the kitchen ever since.

16
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,602
Your gal likes goin'
for long drives,

17
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:44,304
chit‐chattin' around town
like gas ain't a buck‐forty.

18
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:45,672
With zero regard
for the amount of lawns

19
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:47,240
you gotta mow
to fill the cocksucker.

20
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:49,209
Your pal squeezed
into the same section

21
00:00:49,242 --> 00:00:51,912
of a revolving door behind you
one time and you're still pals.

22
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:53,113
But, like,

23
00:00:53,146 --> 00:00:55,616
you're not about to sit beside
him at a fuckin' campfire.

24
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,350
Jivin' Pete says
his new gal

25
00:00:57,383 --> 00:00:58,752
looks like
a young Shania Twain

26
00:00:58,785 --> 00:01:00,420
and you just don't have
the Timbits to tell him

27
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:03,256
that she looks more like Post
Malone's fucked Dion Phaneuf's.

28
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:05,191
You know it's tits‐up
for your ball team

29
00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:07,327
when the opposing pitcher's
got arms so big,

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,162
he could throw
a cotton ball over a barn.

31
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,330
You knew your pal
had come into money

32
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:12,232
when he started throwing out
perfectly good pistachios,

33
00:01:12,265 --> 00:01:13,466
like he was above
cranking 'em open

34
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:14,935
with a box cutter
like the rest of us.

35
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:16,603
You're pretty sweet
on your new gal,

36
00:01:16,637 --> 00:01:18,805
but if she forgets to close
the third door of your truck

37
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:20,440
before the passenger door
one more time,

38
00:01:20,473 --> 00:01:21,708
it's fuckin' over.
I've had it.

39
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:24,377
You caught a whiff of a gals

40
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,512
that smelled like
campfire smokes

41
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:27,814
and that shit's got ya stiff
as a week‐old Slim Jims.

42
00:01:27,848 --> 00:01:30,717
Your friend's dad gets so mad
sometimes, he hollers "fuck,"

43
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:33,554
but doesn't pronounce the C‐K
at the end, he's so squirrelly.

44
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:34,755
So it sounds more like "fu"!

45
00:01:34,788 --> 00:01:35,822
Fu!
Fu!

46
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:37,257

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,525

that he was

and he seen a dude
in the washroom at the urinal.

00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:03,489
And he was working
his iPad while he...

Rocked one, yeah.

till after he rocked one.

Big time.

162
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:14,094

is what I want to know.

he's puttin' in the iPad?

I can tell you what he's
putting in the iPad.

166
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:19,733
Here's what he's
putting into the iPad.

167
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,101
The codes.

168
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:23,937
"The" codes?

169
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,805
Those codes.

170
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:26,907
That's a thing that
could be so urgent.

171
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,275
That's the one thing
that could be so urgent.

172
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:30,544
What a goof.

173
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:32,646

at the urinal,

with your iPad,
your dick out...

175
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:36,016
Silly.
This nut sac

176
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:38,952
is one in a chain of
commanding political figures

177
00:07:38,985 --> 00:07:40,286
with access to the codes

178
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,155
to green light
a nuclear strike.

179
00:07:42,188 --> 00:07:43,389
That's who he is.

180
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:46,026
And he had to get his portion
of the codes in immediately,

181
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:47,894
so that the warheads
could take flight.

182
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:49,095
Why's he firing
a warhead?

183
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:52,232
Well, someone would have had
to fire a warhead first, right?

184
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,034
You know, if I'm that dude
at the airport,

185
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,702
with my dick out,
working on my iPad,

186
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:57,137
I mean, the whole
fuckin' world's at stake.

187
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,639
There's
multiple warheads?

188
00:07:58,672 --> 00:08:01,742
Both sides would have
to have warheads in the air

189
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:04,210
or projectiles,
if it's nuclear war, yes.

190
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:05,345
Those are some stakes.

191
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:07,013
What else
could be so urgent?

192
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:08,682
Not much else
could be so urgent.

193
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:10,651
So the other three in the
political chain of command

194
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:12,252
had already entered
their portion of the codes

195
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:14,020
and they just needed,

196
00:08:14,054 --> 00:08:15,889
we'll call him Gary,

197
00:08:15,922 --> 00:08:17,323
to enter his portion
of the codes.

198
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:18,925
Hmm...
What?

199
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,326
Wonder how
Gary's working it?

200
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,595
What are we
talking about here,

201
00:08:21,628 --> 00:08:23,129

Or...

202
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:24,598
Both.
Both?

203
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:26,700
Curious as to
whether he had

204
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,301
one hand on his horn
and one on the iPad.

205
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:30,170
Because if he's pissing
hands‐free,

206
00:08:30,203 --> 00:08:31,938
then he'd get the codes
typed in much faster.

207
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:33,006
Oh, way faster.

208
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,941
(SCOFFS) At least
twice as fast.

209
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:36,176
Yeah, and he's
in a hurry for sure,

00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:16,523
ALL: Ferda!

319
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:19,860
(GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING)

320
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:25,098
Bonnie.
Wayne.

321
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:26,633
Hi there.
Hi, dare.

322
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,334
I'll have
the pinot noir, please.

323
00:13:28,368 --> 00:13:29,670
(IN FRENCH ACCENT)
Is that what you'll take, then?

324
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:31,171
Not a good look, Bonnie.

325
00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:32,539
Beer?

326
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:33,940
Please and thank you.

327
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,346
She was being
a bit of a cow, eh?

328
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,183
That's McMurray's sister.
She comes by it honestly.

329
00:13:43,216 --> 00:13:44,150
She's pretty.

330
00:13:44,184 --> 00:13:46,520
Oh, she's a lovely girl,
for the most part.

331
00:13:46,553 --> 00:13:49,055
So much petty hostility between
English and French.

332
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:50,423
Yeah, it's a bit obnoxious,
isn't it?

333
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:51,625
I'm glad
we agree on that.

334
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:53,059
As long as we can also agree

335
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:54,595
that French toast
is a waste of time.

336
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:56,062
So are
English muffins.

337
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:57,230
There ya go.

338
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:02,402
I was thinking about the dude

339
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:03,469
McMurray saw at the airport.

340
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:05,205
There's a lot
to unpack there, eh?

341
00:14:05,238 --> 00:14:06,306
You're Gary.
Mmm‐hmm...

342
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:07,541
You're one of the four.
Mmm‐hmm.

343
00:14:07,574 --> 00:14:10,544
Your secretary calls and says
the country needs the codes.

344
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:13,313
It wouldn't be a secretary.
Eh?

345
00:14:13,346 --> 00:14:15,315
It'd be one
of the other three.

346
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:17,050
I think you're right.
I'm for sure right.

347
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,152
The other three wouldn't likely
trust Gary's secretary

348
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:20,721
with news
of incoming projectiles.

349
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:21,722
Marie‐Fred, you don't trust

350
00:14:21,755 --> 00:14:23,690
the fuckin' secretary
with the projectiles.

351
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:25,191
The secretary wouldn't have
been sworn in

352
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:26,527
like the other
government officials.

353
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,328
Who knows who
the secretary's working for?

354
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:29,730
Secretary could be workin'
for anybody.

355
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:32,265
There'd be protocol in place.
It would be in writing.

356
00:14:32,298 --> 00:14:34,267
That information
would be so classified.

357
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,302
You know how classified
that information would be?

358
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:37,203
Super classified?

359
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:39,239
One tier up.
It'd be ultra classified.

360
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:40,306
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

361
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,341
Do you wanna know what?

362
00:14:41,374 --> 00:14:42,576
I'm just gonna come right out
and say it here.

363
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:44,044
If I'm one of the four,

364
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:46,112
I get that information
from the horse's mouth

365
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:47,514
or you're not getting
the codes.

366
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:49,583
Wanna take about 20% off?

367
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:51,552
Yeah, I'd take
about 20% off 'er.

368
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:54,120
So, you're Gary.
Mmm‐hmm.

369
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:55,021
One of the other three

370
00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:56,456
commanding government
officials says,

371
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:58,559
"We need the codes. Stat.
Mmm‐hmm. Mmm‐hmm.

372
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:01,528
"This is it, Gary.
Nuclear war!"

373
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:03,764
Jesus Christ,
it's nuclear war.

374
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:05,999
What do you do?

375
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:10,003
I'd piss myself.

376
00:15:10,036 --> 00:15:11,171
Bingo.
I'd have to go,

377
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:12,238
at the very least.

378
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:13,139
Of course, you would.

379
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:14,440
I don't know
if I'd be able to hold it.

380
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:16,276
But I'd be sayin',
"Whoa...

381
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:18,211
"You'd better
fuckin' hold onto her."

382
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:19,279
It's an appropriate
physical response

383
00:15:19,312 --> 00:15:20,647
to news
of incoming warheads.

384
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:22,348
It'd be alarming.

385
00:15:22,382 --> 00:15:24,518
But let's not forget,
you're Gary.

386
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:25,752
Yeah. Yeah.

387
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:27,453
You've got responsibilities
if you're Gary.

388
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,488
You've got the codes.

389
00:15:28,522 --> 00:15:30,423
Whole country's counting
on you if you're Gary.

390
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:33,359
Women and children,
the elderly.

391
00:15:33,393 --> 00:15:36,362
So, you're Gary, you get
the call for the codes...

392
00:15:36,396 --> 00:15:38,031
You say holy shit...
You'd say holy shit...

393
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:40,634
I'm gonna piss myself...
But it's nuclear war.

394
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:44,037
And despite nuclear war,
all this at stake,

395
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,041
Gary's still pissing
while he puts in the codes.

396
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:51,411
You wanna know what?

397
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:52,378
What?

398
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:54,280
The washroom had to have
been right there.

399
00:15:54,314 --> 00:15:55,248
It had to have been
right there.

400
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:57,150
He might already
have been in the washroom.

401
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,251
I think he was
already in there.

402
00:15:58,284 --> 00:16:01,287
You're Gary, you're in
the washroom, you get the call,

403
00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:03,256
need the codes.
I'm gonna piss myself.

404
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:06,126
And he got his iPad out
as fast as he got his dick out?

405
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,094
He was for sure
already in the washroom.

406
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:09,429
Might've already
been on the iPad.

407
00:16:09,462 --> 00:16:13,266
Well, that solves it!
It was a convenience thing then.

408
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,769
You're Gary, you're in the
washroom, you get the call,

409
00:16:15,802 --> 00:16:17,538
need the codes.
"Well, I can get you the codes,

410
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:18,639
"but I'm gonna piss myself."

411
00:16:18,672 --> 00:16:20,140
And he got the codes in,

412
00:16:20,173 --> 00:16:21,575
but didn't piss himself
because...

413
00:16:21,608 --> 00:16:24,711
BOTH: Because he was
already in the washroom.

414
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:25,646
Jesus Christ,

415
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,347
the world could use
a couple of more Garys.

416
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,550
I think we've sleuthed
it out, partner.

417
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,351
Bless ya
for tryin' on "sleuth,"

418
00:16:31,384 --> 00:16:33,820
but, uh, yeah, I think we have
sleuthed it out, partner.

419
00:16:33,854 --> 00:16:35,522
How's your French coming?

420
00:16:35,556 --> 00:16:38,825
Well... (SPEAKING FRENCH)

421
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:49,836
The only thing is...

422
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,171
We'd know if there was

423
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:52,238
a nuclear strike
that was intercepted.

424
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:53,707
Like, it'd be
in the news.

425
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,877
Ah, come on. That many
projectiles in the air?

426
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,411
Let's get real here.

427
00:16:58,444 --> 00:16:59,412
Warheads or not,

428
00:16:59,445 --> 00:17:01,347
we'd know about it.
Like, we'd know it happened.

429
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:03,550
Yeah. The government
wouldn't want us to know,

430
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:04,785
but someone would leak it.

431
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:06,319
I'm looking
at the secretary.

432
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:08,722
Beer for you, Wayne.

433
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:09,823
Thank you, Bonnie.

434
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:11,357
And da pinot noir for 'er.

435
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,396
Ew. Too French.

436
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:17,430
Bonnie...

437
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:20,300
Why don't you go sit down
and drink your wine?

438
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:22,302
What if I don't?

439
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:25,506
(IN FUNNY ACCENT) Den I'd
have to put my wine down.

440
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:38,484
It's bush
party season, boys.

441
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,620
'Tis the season.

442
00:17:39,653 --> 00:17:41,287
Seasons greetings.

443
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:43,156
You know, I'm gonna make
some Caesars with the girls

444
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:44,558
and get geared up
for a gooder.

445
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:45,726
Oh, I'd have a Caesar.

446
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,861
KATY: You can't really see
a Caesar and not want a Caesar.

447
00:17:47,894 --> 00:17:49,896
DAN: That's actually
how they market Caesars.

448
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:00,741
Wayne?

449
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:01,808
Dary.

450
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:03,176
Can I bend your ear
about something?

451
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:04,277
What are you, a bender?

452
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,846
Good one.
Heard it from a cow.

453
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:07,914
I know it's impolite
to kiss and tell, but...

454
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:10,617
I wouldn't say
that's universal, but, okay.

455
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:16,790
Between us girls.
Yeah, between us girls.

456
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:21,161
You ever thrown
so much hip in your life?

457
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:30,236
Between us girls?
Yeah. Between us girls.

458
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,705
I've never thrown
so much hip in my life.

459
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,208
How much hip
we talking?

460
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:36,142
I'm talkin'
like I'll be

461
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:37,711
halfway through
a bowl of cereal and...

462
00:18:37,744 --> 00:18:38,779
Hip.
Oh, yeah.

463
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:39,846
Oh, man.

464
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,314
Same for you?
Oh, yeah.

465
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:42,482
Is that right?

466
00:18:46,587 --> 00:18:47,621
Between us girls?

467
00:18:47,654 --> 00:18:48,722
Of course,
between us girls.

468
00:18:50,624 --> 00:18:52,292
I feel like we met,

469
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:53,459
I punched in

470
00:18:53,493 --> 00:18:54,561
and I haven't
punched out.

471
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:56,362
Can I ask you
something?

472
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:57,698
Of course,
good buddy.

473
00:18:57,731 --> 00:18:59,966
You feel like you're gettin'
any better at it?

474
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,367
I feel like I'm gettin'
a lot better at it.

475
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:02,736
Me too.

476
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:04,571
And I kind of feel like
I was a bit of a novice

477
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:05,706
with the whole thing before.

478
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:08,675
I feel
that way, too.

479
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:10,243
I feel like
with some of the gals

480
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:11,845
I'd done some yessin'
with in the past,

481
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:13,747
they might have thought,
"This guy's a dabbler."

482
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,249
Dary, that's exactly
how I feel.

483
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:18,251
Like, I feel like they might
have seen me as a hopeful,

484
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:19,753
at the very least.

485
00:19:19,786 --> 00:19:23,557
Or like, maybe I was just
apprenticing at the time.

486
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,726
I kind of feel like I might be
a bit of a headliner now.

487
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:26,893
Really?
Oh, yeah.

488
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:30,396
What are we talking, like
large theaters or stadiums?

489
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,899
Well, large theaters
for the time being.

490
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:34,768
But like, if you can
keep going at the rate

491
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:36,803
you're going, you'll be
destined for, like...

492
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:38,371
BOTH: Bigger venues. Yeah.

493
00:19:38,404 --> 00:19:39,573
That's exactly
how I feel.

494
00:19:39,606 --> 00:19:40,707
That's how
I feel, too.

495
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:43,043
MARIE‐FREDERIQUE:
Who wants a Caesar?

496
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:44,878
Oh, I'd have
a Caesar.

497
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:46,547
Can't see a Caesar and
not want a Caesar.

498
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,481
ANIK: That's actually how
they market Caesars.

499
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,952
Is Stewart gonna DJ
this bush party?

500
00:19:51,985 --> 00:19:52,819
Wanna know what?
I haven't seen that

501
00:19:52,853 --> 00:19:54,855
fuckin' nut sac
in the longest time.

502
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:57,924
I wonder where
he's off to.

503
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,993
