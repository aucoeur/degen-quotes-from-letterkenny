from his boys' trips.

00:12:41,842 --> 00:12:43,210
Reilly and Jonesy
called in sick.

314
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:44,812
So, you've got a shot.

315
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:46,847
One hundred shots
to bes precise.

316
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:47,982
Oh, Dan!

317
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:50,551
Well, I'd have a beer.
Katy have a beer?

318
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:52,820
I need a beer.
Marie‐Fred, have a beer?

319
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:54,321
I'd have a beer.
Dan, have a beer?

320
00:12:54,354 --> 00:12:56,156
I'd have a beer.
Dary, have a beer?

321
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,992
You okay?
Fuck sake.

322
00:12:58,025 --> 00:12:59,059
I'll grab them.

323
00:12:59,093 --> 00:13:00,460
This time, yes,
but next time,

324
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:02,196
talk to old Glen. Say, "Glen,
get me some beers."

325
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:04,899
Because technically today I'm
takin' over the bar for Gail.

326
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:06,601
ALL: We know.
Okay. I'm starting to hear,

327
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:08,435
I'm sayin' it a lot
and I'm being really detailed...

328
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:12,206
You comin'?
Thought I'd concealed it.

329
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,074
GAIL: Let's go.
Oh, mercy.

330
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,444
Bonnie, get the hot compress
ready for Gail!

331
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:20,915
She is some special, Wayne.

332
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:23,017
She's like a little
Genevieve Bujold.

333
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,418
Or like a little
Marie‐Josee Croze...

334
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:26,554
Yep, a keeper
if there ever was one, bud.

335
00:13:26,587 --> 00:13:28,222
Just makin' sure...

336
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:30,558
Oh, Daryl. You're a bit
of a tragedy today, aren't ya?

337
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:32,627
A needy boy is a seedy boy.
Okay?

338
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,428
You're gonna
fudge this up, buddy.

339
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:36,531
I don't know why
she's being so distant.
Well...

340
00:13:36,564 --> 00:13:39,567
Take a look in the mirror
you fuckin' asshole!

341
00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:44,471
Wayne! How's the good
'n' you bad are you now?

342
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:48,342
(SNICKERS) You're hammered...
McMurray.

343
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,409
Here they are...

344
00:13:49,443 --> 00:13:51,345
Well, I might've had
a helpin' hand

345
00:13:51,378 --> 00:13:52,446
from a spicy little number

346
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:56,183
by the name of Mrs. Pampered
Puss McMurray. (MUTTERING)

347
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:57,518
(MUTTERING)

348
00:13:57,552 --> 00:13:58,786
Hoo, boy!
MRS. McMURRAY:
I'll tell you what.

349
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:03,457
I might have a little base coat
of ginski in this cocksucker...

350
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,926
Mayfair. The good stuff...

351
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,296
Hey, Gail! How are we doin'
for ginski in this cocksucker?

352
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:12,332
You got the Piger Henricus
from... Quebec?

353
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:14,969
GAIL: I got a Wendigo
if you want a Quebec gin.

354
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:16,671
Awesome... Ginski...

355
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:17,872
Oh, heavens... Okay?

356
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:20,174
Next time ask me 'cause
I'm in charge of the bar today.

357
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:23,110
I am a lucky man.
(SNIFFLES)

358
00:14:23,143 --> 00:14:25,079
Well, now that the
sit‐down pissers

359
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:26,614
are trampin' off to the bar,

360
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:28,315
youse guys wanna
talk about cunt?

361
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:31,451
DAX: What a pain in the ass,
eh, Ronsey?

362
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:33,320
RON: I'd call it a pain
in the dick, Daxy.

363
00:14:33,353 --> 00:14:35,590
Pain in the ass?
Pain in the dick?

364
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:37,491
REILLY AND JONESY:
This is the end of days.

365
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:38,559
Oh, relax, boys.

366
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:40,260
At least it's not the gift
that keeps on giving.

367
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:42,429
Yeah, boys.
Could've been the herp‐dog.

368
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:45,332
How can you be so cold about
this? It's your manhood, boys.

369
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:47,535
Doesn't it just level you
to see it like that?

370
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,972
This isn't your...
This is!

371
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:53,674
(CLAPPING)

372
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,710
DAX AND RON:
Your first STD!

373
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,012
Adorable.

374
00:14:58,045 --> 00:15:01,481
Wait. This...
This isn't yours?

375
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:04,084
DAX AND RON:
No!

376
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:05,352
How many have you had?

377
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:08,222
That's a tough question.

378
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:10,424
I don't even know.
Oh, my God, is that bad?

379
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:11,491
Oh, my God, is it?

380
00:15:11,526 --> 00:15:12,627
I'm more trying
to think of a time

381
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,161
when I didn't have one.

382
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:19,634
(STAMMERS) Two‐wenty?
Thirty?

383
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,570
You're in the ballpark.
I think?

384
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:25,105
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you're terrible.

385
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,006
You're terrible.

386
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,643
How the fuck can you
be so calm about this?

387
00:15:28,676 --> 00:15:30,410
This is the end of days!

388
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:33,047
REILLY AND JONESY: (CRYING)
This is the end of days!

389
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:38,719
I think we learned
a lesson here, buddy.

390
00:15:38,753 --> 00:15:40,054
I think so too, buddy.

391
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:42,456
Which is odd because
we're normally

392
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:44,224
all about
the anti‐lesson, buddy.

393
00:15:44,258 --> 00:15:46,527
Clear eyes, full hearts,
can't lose type thing.

394
00:15:47,628 --> 00:15:49,664
Yeah, it was coming to us, bro.

395
00:15:49,697 --> 00:15:51,498
When we compete
to take down babes...

396
00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:53,267
And nearly win.
Still could win.

397
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,468
But...
Really...

398
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:57,237
BOTH:
No one wins. (GROAN)

399
00:15:57,271 --> 00:16:00,007
It was that
Himlayan‐Bengali‐Croat.

400
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,609
That rascal!

CuntCripple2016.

Please don't feel
like you have to.
Oh, I do.

ALL: Poolside villas.

450
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:35,723
This sweet and tasty
little thing

451
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:38,759
comes and grabs me
right by the short and curlies,

452
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:41,495
right at the poolside bar.
And, believe me, never,

453
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:44,832
ever in your life have you ever
seen so many tasties ever.

454
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:46,701
I'd have a dart.
I didn't fart.

455
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:48,335
Oh, now, now,
hold your horses now,

456
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:50,337
'cause this is about
to get real good.

457
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,241
Now this particular tasty
was of the Australian variety.

Crikey.

459
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:56,944
Now you may not know this,

460
00:19:56,977 --> 00:19:59,880
but down there
they likes you to piss on 'em.

461
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:01,682
No, they don't.
Yes, they do.

462
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:03,250
Actually, I'm told
the dudes from down under

463
00:20:03,283 --> 00:20:05,285
do piss on gals.

464
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,687
But I don't know
what's in it for the gals.

465
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:08,623
So anyways, she says to me,

466
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,892
"I'm gonna go lay in the tub

467
00:20:11,926 --> 00:20:15,530
"and I want you come in there
and have a little piss on me."

468
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:16,664
Fuck sake.

469
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:20,535
So, I says to her, "You want the
yella or the big fella?"

470
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:21,468
Let's have a dart.

471
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:23,470
Oh, no, come on now.
Now we're almost there.

472
00:20:23,504 --> 00:20:25,039
I'm almost done.

473
00:20:25,072 --> 00:20:26,807
I don't really know what to do.

474
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:29,677
I don't know if I'm supposed
to get hard

475
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,780
or where I'm
supposed to piss on her...

476
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:35,282
Dary!
I kinda wanna see where it goes.

477
00:20:35,315 --> 00:20:36,684
So she says to me,

478
00:20:36,717 --> 00:20:39,486
"I'm gonna go in there,
and lay in the tub

479
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,690
"and you're gonna go in there
and get a little bit hard,

480
00:20:42,723 --> 00:20:44,424
"and you're gonna come in

481
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,893
"and have a little piss
on my tits."

482
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:48,462
Dart time!
Fart time. (LAUGHS)

483
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:51,599
No, I just gotta call Anik,
make sure everything's good.

484
00:20:55,002 --> 00:20:56,904
McMurray...
Katy.

485
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:03,744
DAN: (FARTS)
That wasn't a fart.

486
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:08,448
I've got a question for you!
I've got a question for you...

487
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:11,385
Okay. You need to know
that when...

488
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:12,653
What are you doing

489
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:14,354
the last week of May?

490
00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:17,758
Why?
I'll tell you.

491
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:21,662
Every spring, me and about
17 gal pals

492
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:24,364
head down to Cancun
for a girls' weekend.

493
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:27,602
Okay...

494
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:30,004
Let me tell you something
about spring break.

495
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:35,009
The older cunt is there
for the young cock.

496
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:37,845
And the young cock is there
for the older cunt.

497
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:43,450
Oh...

498
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:45,620
(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

499
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,032
Thanks, Glen.
Oh!

500
00:21:58,065 --> 00:21:59,133
Thanks, Bonnie.

501
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,267
It was a pleasure, Gail.

502
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,369
It's always nice to give you
a moment to binge drink,

503
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:04,939
which is a form of alcoholism.

504
00:22:04,972 --> 00:22:06,006
'Kay...

505
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,675
Come on, Glen.
I'll drive you home.

506
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:08,909
Thank you, Bonnie.

507
00:22:08,943 --> 00:22:11,145
And I will sing you hymns
to keep you alert and inspired.

508
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:13,681
No, you won't.
That's fair.

509
00:22:13,714 --> 00:22:14,782
Ladies first.
Okay.

510
00:22:20,154 --> 00:22:21,221
They look so in love.

511
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:23,558
WAYNE: Got every reason
to believe they are, bud.

512
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,492
KATY: But they...
DAN: Miss Katys?

513
00:22:25,793 --> 00:22:27,027
What?

514
00:22:27,061 --> 00:22:30,998
A wee bits earlier I suggested,
quite gently,

515
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:34,001
that what the McMurray's do
is nobody's business.

516
00:22:34,034 --> 00:22:36,837
I remember.
I remember you shouting at me.

517
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:39,173
I'm sorry, Squirrelly Dan.

518
00:22:39,206 --> 00:22:40,641
(WHISPERS)
That's okay, Miss Katys.

519
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:45,145
We are, nones of us perfects.

520
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,850
And that is what I
appreciates about us.

521
00:22:49,884 --> 00:22:51,786
Can I borrow somebody's phone
to call Anik, please?

522
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:53,621
WAYNE AND KATY:
No.

523
00:22:53,654 --> 00:22:55,523
But what have we learned
through all this, Miss Katys?

524
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:58,425
Different strokes,
for different folks. I think?

525
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,562
I think you just nailed it.
