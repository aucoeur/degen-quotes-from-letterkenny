1
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:15,547
Can I have a stick of gum?
Yeah, you wanna stick?

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,781
Yeah, I'll have a stick,
if you got a stick.

3
00:00:16,815 --> 00:00:18,517
Stick of gum.
I'll maybe take a second stick.

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,251
More than one stick?
Was drinkin' from the hose.

5
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:21,485
It's a wee bit rusty
down the line.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,087
That sounds like
a two‐stick fire to me.

7
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:31,262
Dary?
Yeah?

8
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:32,764
Say "about."

9
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:34,699
About.
Okay.

10
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,503
You gots a sticks of gum?
Yeah, you wanna stick?

11
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:40,238
If you gots a sticks,
I'd takes a stick.

12
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:41,840
Stick of gum.
You got more than one stick?

13
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,407
Yeah, you want more than
one stick of gum?

14
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:45,343
I drank some OJ's
after brushin' my teeth.

15
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:46,377
So, I'm breathin' fires.

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,179
Yup, sounds like you need
more than one stick.

17
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:55,520
Dan? Say "about."

18
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:57,455
Abouts.
'Kay.

19
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:01,259
Hey, you want a stick of gum?

20
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:02,426
I know you've got
a stick of gum.

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,762
Yeah, I got a stick.
Give me a stick.

22
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:04,829
Stick of gum.

23
00:01:04,863 --> 00:01:06,364
I'll take another one
for later too.

24
00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:07,498
More than
one stick of gum?

25
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:09,868
Yeah, I had some Gus & Bru
in my coffee this morning.

26
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:11,636
Yeah? You'll need more
than one stick.

27
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:17,876
Katy?
Yeah?

28
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,110
Say...

29
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:21,846
"About."

30
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,281
About.
'Kay.

31
00:01:24,883 --> 00:01:26,518
Why do you keep asking us
to say that, good buddy?

32
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:27,552
Well...

33
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:31,355
A GI Jehovah come up
the laneway the other day.

34
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:32,657
And he said it like,

35
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,392
"a‐boat."

36
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:35,426
"A‐boat?"

37
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,228
Yes, like if you're out
on the water, you're in...

38
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:38,797
A boat.

39
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,165
I ain't never heard no one
says it like, "a‐boats."

40
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:42,767
That's a weird way
to say, "about."

41
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:43,868
Well, to be fair...

42
00:01:43,902 --> 00:01:45,403
♪ To be fair
♪ To be fair

43
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:47,772
♪ To be fair
♪ To be fair

44
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:52,577
To be fair, Yanks think we got
a weird way of saying "about."

45
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:53,845
Yeah, what's that's
all abouts?

46
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:56,681
Well, they say it
like, "abowt."

47
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:58,149
"Abowt?"

48
00:01:58,182 --> 00:02:00,318
Yeah, and they make fun
of us for saying, "about."

49
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:01,620
No, I'm pretty sure

50
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:03,555
Yanks make fun of us
for sayin' "a‐boot."

51
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:04,756
Who says "a‐boot?"

52
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:05,857
Ask a fuckin' Yank.

53
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,626
A boot.

54
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:08,793
Abowt.

55
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:10,795
A‐boot. And now...

56
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:11,863
A‐boat.

57
00:02:11,896 --> 00:02:13,632
Well, what did
the GI have to say?

58
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:14,533
Well...

59
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:17,468
It's about heart,
it's about passion,

60
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:18,436
it's about discipline.

61
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:21,472
It's about not having
Christmas, isn't it?

62
00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:23,708
It's about so much more
than you think it's about.

63
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:24,876
So what did you do?

64
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:26,678
Waste his time
a wee bit,

65
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,880
as you do.

66
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:31,816
Well, then why don't you
tell me what it's about?

67
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,451
It's about Jesus,

68
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:35,219
being God's
only direct creation.

69
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:37,689
It's about
not drinkin', isn't it?

70
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:39,658
It's about not watching
"R" rated movies, as well.

71
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:41,593
Well, it's for sure
about not dancing.

72
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:42,961
Pretty sure someone

73
00:02:42,994 --> 00:02:44,228
told me one time
that's what it's about.

74
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:45,664
For sure. It's about

75
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:47,666
not listening to music
containing immoral lyrics.

76
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:48,800
What's your
fuckin' name?

77
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,401
Bob.
Bob, tell me,

78
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:53,371
what's good about it?

79
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:54,539
Yeah, but what did he
have to say?

80
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,575
You wanna know what? Phone rang
and went inside to get it,

81
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:58,943
kinda forgot he was out there,
so must have skedaddled.

82
00:02:58,977 --> 00:03:00,812
No!

83
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:02,013
And I'd be more
than happy to continue

84
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:04,448
telling you what being a
Jehovah's Witness is all about.

85
00:03:04,482 --> 00:03:06,317
How about I leave you
behind some literature?

86
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,619
What's your
fuckin' name again?

87
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:08,687
Bob.

88
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,988
Get the fuck
outta here, Bob.

89
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:11,222
Okay.

90
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,358
Hey! What'd you get into?

91
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:15,894
He could use
a stick of gum.

92
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:17,929
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

93
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,377
Oh, Mennonites.

94
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:34,579
Menno‐nappers.

95
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:36,715
WAYNE: Fuck, can they run,
those Nappers.

96
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:38,449
That looks like
Noah Dyck.

97
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:40,519
WAYNE: And Anita Dyck.

98
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:44,422
Wayne.
Mr. Dyck.

99
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:46,591
Dyck with a "Y," yes.
Daryl.

100
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,693
Mrs. Dyck.

101
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:50,662
Wayne, feel free
to call me Noah Dyck.

102
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:52,864
And, Daryl, please continue
to call me Mrs. Dyck.

103
00:03:52,897 --> 00:03:54,599
Brings ya up the laneway?

104
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:57,669
Wayne, your family's always been
very good to our community

105
00:03:57,702 --> 00:03:59,738
and we appreciate it, once.

106
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:01,606
You've used us right
and hopefully you feel

107
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,441
as though we've used
you right, too.

108
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:04,576
Without question.

109
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,310
We appreciate it, once.

110
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:09,013
Which is why I know
I can count on your discretion.

111
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:11,950
Especially in a matter
as sensitive as this one.

112
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:13,417
Can confirm.

113
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:14,452
Okay.

114
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:16,955
This is not easy to say,

115
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:18,557
nor is it by any means
an accusation...

116
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,659
Where are our daughters?
Anita Dyck. Now.

117
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:22,326
Please.

118
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:25,864
Our daughter, Charity.
Charity Dyck?

119
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:27,766
And her sister Chastity...

120
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:28,833
Chastity Dyck?

121
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:30,502
Are on their
gap year, once...

122
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:31,636
Isn't that called
Rumspringa?

123
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,704
Men are talking, Daryl.

124
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:33,972
Anita Dyck and I are concerned

125
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:35,807
that our little Dycks
have been bitten,

126
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:38,743
by the good time bug.

127
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:41,613
And while Dycks have been known
to slip out on occasion,

128
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:43,682
our fear

129
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:45,049
is that our Dycks have

130
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,485
been out longer than
we're comfortable with, once.

131
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,053
Have you seen
our Dycks?

132
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:50,622
About yea tall, once.

133
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:52,423
Strong nose,
like their father,

134
00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:54,058
strong‐willed,
like their mother.

135
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:56,795
I did see them
at the bush party, actually.

136
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:59,063
Dycks at a bush party,
you say?

137
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:00,799
I knew it.
Shameful.

138
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:02,967
Haven't seen them
since though, truth be told.

139
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:05,970
Katy, you seen
a Dyck or two?

140
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:08,039
That's a loaded question,
big brother.

141
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:11,643
Hello, Katy.

142
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,412
Noah. Anita.

143
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:15,479
Katherine.

144
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:17,081
Lovely day.

145
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:18,382
What brings
you guys by?

146
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:21,452
We heard out daughters
were here and...

147
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:22,353
Charity and...

148
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:24,022
We'll take all the
Charity Dyck you've got.

149
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:26,591
All the Chastity Dyck,
too.

150
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,759
We want Charity
and Chastity home

151
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:30,795
before they get swayed into
a life of bad decisions, once.

152
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:31,896
They are free to decide whether

153
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,698
the English world is for them.
That is their right.

154
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:34,833
But our Dycks belong
in the hands of

155
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,601
the Mennonite community.

156
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:37,936
And we would like to gently

157
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:39,871
suggest to them that they
return home with us

158
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:42,541
before they've
been too exposed.

159
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:46,711
Well, the last I saw them,
they were with hockey players.

160
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:47,879
(GASPS)

161
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:50,615
I offered to give them
a ride home but,

162
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,884
they said that
they wanted to walk.

163
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:55,153
We Dycks can be hard‐headed.

164
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:57,421
Hockey players have
quite the reputation

165
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:58,389
for sticking their noses,

166
00:05:58,422 --> 00:05:59,824
and other things,
where they don't belong.

167
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:01,526
Can confirm.

168
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,927
Oh, dear.
My goodness.

169
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:04,896
Good heavens.
Heaven only knows.

170
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,164
Well, the good news is,

171
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:08,700
there's only a couple of places
hockey players tend to hang out.

172
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:10,434
Yeah, the gym or the barn.

173
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:12,003
The barn?
Oh, dear.

174
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:13,404
My goodness.
Good heavens.

175
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:15,774
Heaven only knows.
The hayloft.

176
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,943
Intertwined
in breathy clusters.

177
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:20,645
Look, I should clarify.

178
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:22,146
The barn, as in the hockey rink.

179
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:24,148
Yeah, you're looking for two

180
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:25,850
puck heads
drivin' a Tonka truck.

181
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:27,051
That's Reilly and Jonesy.

182
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:28,219
And Noah, please go ahead

183
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:30,421
and let us know if there's
anything else we can do to help.

184
00:06:30,454 --> 00:06:33,491
Wayne, our entire community
thanks you for your kindness

185
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:35,159
as you've shown us here
this day, once.

186
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:37,562
Well,

187
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:39,063
it looks like
a couple of Dycks.

188
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:40,965
Oh, hello there, Daniel.

189
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,768
Haven't seen you
in the age of a dog.

190
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:47,572
Well,

191
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:48,707
until soon.

192
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,915
Goddamn Schmellies.

193
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,487
Whoa.

194
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:03,822
(MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO)

195
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:12,564
And a good day
to ye both.

196
00:07:13,798 --> 00:07:16,234
I'm Noah Dyck,
with a "Y."

197
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:17,902
And this is my wife.
Anita Dyck.

198
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:20,872
Ah, that's Jonesy.

199
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:21,906
That's Reilly.

200
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:23,775
Hello.

201
00:07:23,808 --> 00:07:26,144
Sorry to bother you,
but we were wondering if...

202
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:27,746
Where are our daughters?
Yes.

203
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,480
Dunno.
Ditto.

204
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:33,852
Sorry for the confusion.
It's just that Wayne

205
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:36,721
seemed to think you might
have seen our Dycks.

206
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:40,258
Oh, those Dycks.

207
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,061
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Charity and, um...

208
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:45,029
The other one.
Chastity.

209
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:47,732
Yeah. Yeah, it's all
coming back to me now.

210
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,233
We, we, we met them.

211
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:51,570
But we didn't, like,
meet them.

212
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:53,471
No, definitely
never met them.

213
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:56,240
Well, have you
seen them?

214
00:07:56,274 --> 00:08:00,144
Not, like, seen them,
if that's what you mean.

215
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:02,013
We're definitely
not seeing your Dycks.

216
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:03,548
You know what I mean?
You know what I mean?

217
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:04,583
No.

218
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:08,987
But I do know this. If I find
out you're lying to me,

219
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,790
the wrath of an angry Dyck
will leave a lasting mark. Once.

220
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:15,093
Well, maybe check
the Dollar Store.

221
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:17,028
They may be dancing
with the skids or something.

222
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:19,598
Thank you so much
for your time.

223
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,533
Praise be to God.
Praise be to Him.

224
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:23,802
Praise be to you.
Praise be.

225
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:27,138
Well, blessed is the fruit.

226
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,607
May the Lord open.

227
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:32,977
ANITA: Must be
a new translation.

228
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:35,079
What the fuck was that?

229
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:43,922
You almost blew it!

230
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:46,257
Charity!
(LAUGHING)

231
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,861
You know, you guys
have been around like, a lot.

232
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:51,896
The Dycks love
the English world.

233
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:52,997
Yeah, but I mean,

234
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:55,967
the Mennonite world has
its perks, too, I'm sure.

235
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,569
Just put a little English
on a Dyck.

236
00:08:57,602 --> 00:08:59,771
And we'll put a little
Mennonite on a penis.

237
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:01,573
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

238
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:05,143
Dan, why do you hate
Mennonites so much?

239
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:06,945
They're nice people,
good workers.

240
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:08,012
They're great workers.

241
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:09,614
Good runners, too.
Fuck, can they run.

242
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,583
They drive a hard bargain
on the business side.

243
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:13,151
Yeah, can be
a wee bit sheisty.

244
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:15,253
Oh, they run like the wind.
Every one of them can run.

245
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:17,288
Tight with money.
Great workers.

246
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:19,090
They'll show you a thing
or two about good work.

247
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:21,292
They'll beat you in a race, boy.
Fuck, can they run.

248
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:24,128
Just because I respects them
don't means I can't hates them.

249
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:25,964
I'm gonna need a minute

250
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:28,266
with that. That was like
a quadruple negative.

251
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:30,702
Well, how can you hate 'em?
They're harmless.

252
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:32,136
That's what they
wants you to think.

253
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,638
But deep down they're judgier

254
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:35,106
than Judge Reinhold
and Judge Judy

255
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:36,207
watching Judge Dredds.

256
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,308
Oh, is that
what they are?

257
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:38,743
I was fifteens
at the time.

258
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:39,811
Is that what you were?

259
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:41,646
It was the Letterkenny
Days picnic,

260
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,981
hottest day in July.

261
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:44,382
I believe yous were away
at a balls tournament.

262
00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:46,117
The Jeff Davies Memorial.

263
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,185
Jeff Davies
was fast too.

264
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:49,387
Not as fast as a Napper, though.
Fuck, can they run.

265
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,990
Anyhoo, it was
the tater sack race.

266
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:53,124
I always hated them.

267
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:54,192
Burlap burns.

268
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:57,762
First prize was an ice‐cold
glass of lemonades.

269
00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:59,063
We lined up at the start line
and looked across to

270
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:01,766
the finish line and
there she was.

271
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,803
A little Schmellie, holdin' up
the prize lemonades,

272
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:05,770
almost like a mirage.

273
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:07,405
That's my favorite
all‐time chocolate bar.

274
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:08,640
We locked eyes and smiled.

275
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:11,710
Despite her broad shoulders,
she was cute as a bug's horn.

276
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:12,777
Good runner, too, no doubt.

277
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,714
I was in first place coming down
to the finish line,

278
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:17,248
like the wind.

279
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:18,917
So I guess you
could say you had it

280
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:20,418
in the bag?

281
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:21,653
Hey‐o!
Hey‐o!

282
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:23,087
I did.

283
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:26,224
When out of nowhere, this...

284
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:28,960
Schmellie in a sack...

285
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:30,028
No, I told you
they were fast.

286
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:31,162
I'm the one who's been saying

287
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:33,231
this entire time how fast
they are. Fuck, can they run.

288
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:35,299
He comes tearing up
from behinds me,

289
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,768
knocks me over,

290
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:38,002
ass over teakettles.

291
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:39,137
Wasn't he disqualified?

292
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,238
No.

293
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:42,440
Well, Schmellies are sheisty.

294
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:43,975
Yeah,
he should have been DQ'd

295
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:45,076
like a chocolate‐dipped cone.

296
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:46,210
So who was he?

297
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:47,378
Who's to say?

298
00:10:47,411 --> 00:10:49,080
It all happened so fast.

299
00:10:49,113 --> 00:10:52,150
I've never seens that
Schmellie before or since.

300
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:53,317
Alls I know is I watched him

301
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:55,153
hop across the finish line
upside down

302
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:57,088
and claim my prize.

303
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:58,289
Why was he upside down?

304
00:10:58,322 --> 00:10:59,791
He wasn't.

305
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:00,825
I was.

306
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,360
I ates it.

307
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:05,229
Never got to the lemonade.

308
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:07,098
Never got to chats with her.

309
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:09,400
I never even
seens her again.

310
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:11,235
But I'll never forgets her.

311
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:12,704
And guess who she was?

312
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:13,838
ALL: Who?

313
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:17,141
Lovina Dyck.

314
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:19,043
ALL: Lovina Dyck?

315
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:21,713
That's right,
Lovina Dyck.

316
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:24,816
Younger sister
of one Noah Dyck!

317
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,951
Yeah, I know who that is.
Fuck, she can run, boy.

318
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,120
So you had a crush
on a Schmellie?

319
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:31,089
I did.

320
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:33,291
And I had my hearts
broken that day.

321
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:35,193
And ever since then

322
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:37,461
I have never trusted
a Menno‐napper.

And a Schmellie Dyck even?

327

Let's try and find a way

to never say Schmellie
and Dyck in the same sentence.

gonna be a thing.

472

of getting double‐Dycked?

476

I, Noah Dyck,

477
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:40,825
am looking
for my daughters.

478
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,460
They're on their
gap year, once,

479
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:44,262
and we are fearful

480
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:46,765
that the
hedonistic lifestyle

481
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:48,399
has captured
their imaginations.

482
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:51,135
Ugh, preach.
I know all about it.

483
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:52,771
You do?
Well, of course I do.

484
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:55,439
My parents were both in
missionary positions in Africa.

485
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:57,275
So, on my gap year,

486
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:58,643
I ran away and joined an

487
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,613
all‐male period revue
about dolphin poaching,

488
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:03,414
called Master and Baiter.

489
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:05,617
Yelp reviews included,
"It's fin‐tastic,"

490
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,752
and, "A performance
with porpoise."

491
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,153
Honest to pod?

492
00:18:09,187 --> 00:18:11,489
(LAUGHING)
Noah!

493
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,624
Honest to cod.

494
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:14,893
(ALL LAUGHING)

495
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:17,295
One meanie on Yelp,
however, wrote,

496
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:19,197
"Will this every dol‐finish?"

497
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,900
But I didn't care because
a buddy of mine and I

498
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:25,169
made a blowhole we were
both super proud of.

499
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:29,574
Have you seen
our Dycks or not?

500
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,242
Anita Dyck, full stop.

501
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,645
I have not.

502
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:35,346
However, here's a thought.

503
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,448
Go to the farm
and ask Wayne,

504
00:18:37,481 --> 00:18:39,417
because I know
if I was a teenage girl,

505
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,252
and I'm 80% sure
that I am not,

506
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:44,388
that's exactly where I would go
to get my gap filled.

507
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,759
(CARRIAGE APPROACHING)

508
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:49,260
NOAH: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

509
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,771
Here I stand...

510
00:19:01,706 --> 00:19:02,841
Dyckless.

511
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,776
Is that the Jeep

512
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:06,344
that belongs to those
two sleeveless ne'er do wells?

513
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:08,647
Um...
Noah, Anita.

514
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,782
As you mentioned
previously,

515
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:13,184
we've always been honest
with each other.

516
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:14,786
God rewards honesty, once.

517
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:16,621
God is the way,
the truth and the life.

518
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,322
Those two nut sacs
are in the house.

519
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:19,624
Wayne!
Katy!

520
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,827
If anyone in town
was missing a kid or a cat,

521
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,830
Nappers'd be the first ones
knockin' offering help.

522
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,632
It's only right
we pay that forward.

523
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,401
Do unto others as you would
have them do unto.

524
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:31,636
A golden.

525
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,805
Wayne's right.

526
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:36,541
Might as well come out, boys.
The jig is up.

527
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:40,512
God help you both!
Anita Dyck. Anita Dyck.

528
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:42,581
Dycks, please!

529
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,548
Now we've all done things

530
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,618
in our younger years
that we later regrets.

531
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:48,720
What didn't kill us,
perhaps it made us stronger.

532
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:50,321
If it was a bad time,

533
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:51,756
maybe it led
to a good story.

534
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,592
Sometimes even both.

535
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,494
But these young fellas
was just being young fellas.

536
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,862
You can't faults 'em
for that.

537
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,565
Just like your young gals
was just being young gals.

538
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,466
Curious. Experimentals.

539
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,535
Super bendy.

540
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:04,636
Gumby bendy.

541
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:06,971
That's enough of...
Anita Dyck. Anita.

542
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,773
Tongues are like
Aces, boys,

543
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,509
you gotta know
when to hold 'em.

544
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,010
My point is there's also

545
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:14,245
things we regrets in life
that we didn't do.

546
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:16,480
This is one time in my life
I don't need a sermon, Daniel.

547
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,584
Anita Dyck, let's listen
with our heart on our sleeve.

548
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,921
For examples, I regrets
not telling your sister...

549
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:23,888
She's Lovina Dyck.

550
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,791
Yes, no, I know.
I know who your sister is.

551
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:27,926
And I regrets not telling

552
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:30,529
your sister, Lovinas Dycks,
that I was sweet on her

553
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,796
all them years ago.

554
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,966
I let my foolish pride
gets in my way.

555
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:37,536
Well, Dan, I had no idea.

556
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,970
Although, it makes
perfect sense.

557
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:40,539
She's a wonderful woman.

558
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,341
With a heart as big
as her shoulders are broad.

559
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:45,977
But I'm confused, once.

560
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,479
What does this have to do
with our tiny Dycks?

561
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,350
Well, I'm quite sure that your
daughters are gonna regret

562
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:54,886
exchanging bodily fluids
with these young fellas less

563
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,721
than I regrets not letting

564
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,023
Lovina Dycks knows
I was sweets on her.

565
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,359
Wanna know what, Squirrelly D?
I'm really rooting for you here.

566
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:02,426
But you can go ahead

567
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,963
and summit Mount What's
Your Point any time now.

568
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:07,732
So, you likes to drive
a hard bargain.

569
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,668
Yeah, Nappers are
a wee bit sheisty.

570
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,603
Here's mine.

571
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:13,037
If you lets this go,

572
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,673
I'll bring your gals to ya.

573
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,575
I seen 'em ups town
not too long ago.

574
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:19,811
But once
I bring 'em to ya,

575
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:22,480
you've gots to brings mes
to Lovinas Dycks,

576
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:25,349
so we can have a long
overdues conversation.

577
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,586
And maybe then all of us
can gets some closures.
