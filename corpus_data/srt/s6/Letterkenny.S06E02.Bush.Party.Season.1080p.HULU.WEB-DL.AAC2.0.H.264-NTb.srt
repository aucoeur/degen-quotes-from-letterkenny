1
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:13,592
The dog gave you
a wee bit of a scare
the other day.

2
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:16,361
A stroke?
That's what I said.

3
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:18,664
But he didn't have a stroke.
That's what they said.

4
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:20,231
Why'd you thinks
he was havin' a strokes?

5
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:22,333
Well, he was out layin'
in the sun for a few hours,

6
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:25,036
when he came back up the house,
his back end was all honey dick.

7
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:27,005
How so?

8
00:00:27,038 --> 00:00:30,241
Well, it was like he was trying
to walk and scratch himself
at the same time

9
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:32,343
and his brain couldn't figure
out which one to focus on.

10
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:33,411
So what did you do?

11
00:00:33,444 --> 00:00:34,713
I said, "Oh, fuck, this is it."

12
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:35,714
Is that what you did?

13
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:36,582
I said, "Oh, fuck,
you're getting the needle.

14
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:38,216
"Better get one ready
for me, too."

15
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:39,551
He's okay, good buddy.

16
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:40,652
Oh, fuck,
"If we're diggin' a hole,

17
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:42,087
"better dig a big one,
I'm gettin' in there with him."

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,121
But it's all been sorted?

19
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:45,290
Oh, it's all sorted but I said,
"Oh, fuck," Dary.

20
00:00:45,323 --> 00:00:47,492
Yeah, we oughta leave
this world behind.
That's what I said.

21
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:50,428
You knew that he was
on bladder meds
for the last three weeks.

22
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:51,697
Fuckin' geezer.

23
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,499
And that he'd be passing
the bladder stones
sometime around now

24
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:56,301
and to expect
some odd behavior,

25
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:58,136
you still go
worst case scenario?

26
00:00:58,169 --> 00:00:59,470
I said, "Oh, fuck, this is it."

27
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:00,506
And what was the verdict?

28
00:01:01,507 --> 00:01:02,440
Passin' bladder stones.

29
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:05,276
Exactly. Just passing
some bladder stones.

30
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,377
There a fuckin' echo
in here, Katy?

31
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:07,679
I think he faked it.

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,315
Faked what?

33
00:01:10,348 --> 00:01:11,617
A stroke.

34
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,819
Why would the dog
fakes a strokes?

35
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:18,056
Gus faked a stroke so that
he could go to the vet and get
a thermometer up the bum.

36
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,694
Look, if you're comin'...

37
00:01:24,295 --> 00:01:25,831
you better come correct.

38
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:29,501
Well, look how Stormy responds
to a thermometer up the bum.
Hates her life.

39
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:30,769
No time for a knuckler
there either.

40
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:31,737
No time for a two‐knuckler.

41
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,639
There's no such thing
as a three‐knuckler.

42
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:35,040
Which we've established.

43
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:38,443
Cito, too. Even the sight
of a thermometer,
send him scrambling.

44
00:01:38,476 --> 00:01:40,679
Yeah. God help the vet
tries to throw a knuckler
up Cito's bum.

45
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:42,280
Vet might not get that one back.

46
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:43,348
What are you sayin' here, Katy?

47
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,617
I'm saying that Gus is...

48
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:47,352
Look, if you're comin'...
you better come correct!

49
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:48,386
Gus is gay.

50
00:01:54,726 --> 00:01:55,761
No, he isn't.

51
00:01:55,794 --> 00:01:57,162
Yeah, he is.

52
00:01:57,596 --> 00:01:58,697
No, he isn't.

53
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,598
Yeah, he is.

54
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,432
Have you ever seen him
mount a female?

55
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:05,203
He's a gentleman.

56
00:02:05,236 --> 00:02:07,673
But you've seen him mount
countless males.

57
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:10,576
He'd mount the red‐hot tailpipe
of a high CC quad.
Katy, come off it!

58
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:12,578
What if he is gay?
What's the big deal?

59
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:13,645
I don't give a fuck if he's gay.

60
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:14,846
Maybe you do.

61
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,381
Maybe you think that...

62
00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:17,716
Just gimme a minute.
Gotta let that...

63
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:20,786
Gotta let that marinate.

64
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,354
Hey, Dary,
what if Gus was gay?

65
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:24,489
I don't give a fuck
if he's gay.

66
00:02:24,523 --> 00:02:26,625
Dan, what if Gus is gay?

67
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:29,394
Well, Professor Tricia's...
I withdraw.

68
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:31,797
See, Wayne, Gus is gay.
What's the big deal?

69
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,399
I already said I don't give
a fuck if he's gay.

70
00:02:34,432 --> 00:02:35,801
Well, that makes me very happy.

71
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:37,736
Just don't, uh...

72
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:40,305
Don't go sayin' that
around McMurray.
Why?

73
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:42,373
McMurray gets weird
about that stuff.

74
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:43,308
How so?

75
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:46,277
Like, he's fine with it,
if you're gay...

76
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:48,113
If you're queer.

77
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:52,250
Maybe he'd like to get
honey dickin'.

78
00:02:52,283 --> 00:02:56,187
He just, uh, gets kind of weird
talkin' about it, is all.

79
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:57,723
How does he talk about it?

80
00:02:57,756 --> 00:02:59,257
Well, he'll just get
all uncomfortable, you know.

81
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,459
He'll be like, ahem...

82
00:03:01,492 --> 00:03:05,531
"Uh, you know, if one of them
come up to me and say,
'You're fuckin' cute, bud...'

83
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:07,232
"From what I said
right from the start

84
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:09,635
"at the very beginning,
'I ain't one of ya.'"

85
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:11,670
That is about the best shit
I've heard all day.

86
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:16,441
Ahem, "If they ever come up
to me and say,
'Fuck, are you cute, bud.'"

87
00:03:16,474 --> 00:03:18,777
"You wanna know what I said
right from the start
at the very beginning?"

88
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,913
"Yeah, uh, I... I love my wife.
And you know, uh..."

89
00:03:21,947 --> 00:03:23,181
Keep it away from me?

90

"No... not around me."

91
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:26,417
"Because, I ain't one of ya."

92

What... what's going on there?

313
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:10,128
Take downs,
by the looks of it.

314
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:12,197
No. With the Amish girls.

315
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,365
No, they're not Amish.
They're Mennonite.

316
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,567
What's the difference?

317
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:18,436
Mennonites can use
cars and electricity.
Amish can't.

318
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:19,605
Menno‐nappers.

Shmelly's.

321
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:24,242
They're in this period
of their lives called Rumspringa

322
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:26,612
where they can just carry on
like the rest of us for a while.

323
00:14:26,645 --> 00:14:28,046
Call us the English.

324
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,948
Yeah.
We're in the English world.

325
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:31,583
We've been called worse.

326
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:34,986
They can co to parties and be
shit heads without any
consequence from their parents.

327
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,956
They can still go home
and have a bed to sleep
in no matter what.

328
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:39,758
Why just let them
go be shit heads?

329
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:43,328
Well, it's to help them decide
whether or not they want to stay
in the English world permanently

330
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:46,131
or go back
to the Mennonite world
and be with their families.

331
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:47,298
What's in the Mennonite world?

332
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:48,600
Whole lotta chorin'.

333
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:50,235
Great pride in community.

334
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:53,505
Generations and generations
of inbreedings.

335
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:55,240
How many stay
in the English world?

336
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:56,307
Few.

337
00:14:56,341 --> 00:14:57,342
But some do?

I'm down for trans action.

348

Keep your dealings disclosed,
lest we be made manifest.
