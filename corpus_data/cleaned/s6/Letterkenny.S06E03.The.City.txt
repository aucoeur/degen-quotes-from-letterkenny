Period. <START> I'd have chosen an exclamation point. <START> I think you're right. <START> Past notes haven't quite landed. <START> Do you know what I mean? <START> Yes, sans duress. <START> They don't exactly have the tiger by the tail, do they? <START> Not exactly whipping the excitement up to a real fever pitch. <START> No. <START> They are not. <START> For a plethora of reasons. <START> This death note, presumably the final installment, it requires urgency. <START> Some sort of accent, I would agree. <START> The exclamation point guides the reader to approach it more threateningly. <START> Like, there's stakes there. <START> Like, "It's on!" Right? <START> Exactly. <START> As opposed to a period. <START> Because, if it's me. <START> It's you. <START> I read it like. "It's on." The period leaves the decision up to the reader. <START> It does suggest a more docile read. <START> There's no room for ambiguity in death threats. <START> Exclamation point? <START> Yes. <START> Sexclamation point. <START> Oh. <START> Go stick that on the door! <START> Alleyyoop. <START> Okay. <START> Let's clean this shit up and go back in. <START> I need to find something to wear tonight. <START> Get my hussy on. <START> Give me five calendar minutes to digest, and I'll join ya. <START> Oh, so you're looking to find a nice bench to have a sit down outside a lingerie store, Dary?

<START> Public washrooms is disgusting. <START> Poo particles is literally's airborne's. <START> Oh, ceased mingling with the peasants again now, have we, Dan. <START> Won't find a more violent environments on the planet Earth. <START> Not for my money. <START> Not for my money either. <START> Oh, how's the weather up there in your ivory tower, Wayne? <START> Well, I'll go in, just won't have a sitdown. <START> I'll rock one, like a good old boy. <START> Not a monster. <START> Must be nice to have the option. <START> Well, I just get the giggles is all. <START> Ain't nothin' to giggle about in a cesspool of fecal matters and peepees. <START> Sure there is. <START> What?

<START> Well, you don't know him. <START> He doesn't know you. <START> He ain't never heard one like that before. <START> Yeah, farts will never not be funny. <START> I will never not laugh at a fart. <START> There's even a courtesy aspect of it, too. <START> Ah, this should be interesting. <START> Well, like if you go into a public bathroom, there's a guy in a stall, he'll announce his presence to you. <START> Like how? <START> He's sittin' there and maybe he'll clear his throat. <START> Like. <START> That's exactly how they do it, Dary. <START> They go. <START> Why would he want to announce that he's having a sit down? <START> Well, the first sound you hear is not a fart. <START> He's prepping you for the acoustics. <START> And how is that courteous? <START> Well, let's say you're like me, you get the giggles. <START> From a fart?
