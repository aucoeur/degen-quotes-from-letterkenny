<START> You're discussing critical space stuff with your pals the other day. <STOP> <START> How would you batch in space? <STOP> <START> With immaculate care. <START> Yeah, it'd go airborne if you didn't contain it. <STOP> <START> Depends on the length of the missions, I thinks. <STOP> <START> Like, if it's a pretty short mission, you can probably gets away without mixing a batch up theres. <STOP> <START> Maybe you can get away without mixing a batch. <STOP> <START> I mix one every night or I'm not sleeping. <STOP> <START> Kind of likes how I needs to takes a shower immediately afters I takes a shits? <START> You'd cone it. <STOP> <START> What? <STOP> <START> Each spaceman's given a cone, put over your junk, for when you batch in space. <STOP> <START> They do? <STOP> <START> So let's say you're in your space quarters, you lay on your back in your bunk, put the cone over your junk and fire one up, and since it's zero gravity, your batch'd float up to the top of the cone, and remain there. <STOP> <START> Then what'll you do with it? <STOP> <START> Each cadet's got a space disposal in their quarters, so he'll just throw it in there. <STOP> <START> That what they do? <STOP> <START> Most important thing is to obstruct the space cam in your quarters so that the rest of the space cadets don't see you batching. <STOP> <START> I'd imagine they'd give you a few cones. <STOP> <START> Probably stick one of those cones over the camera. <STOP> <START> Exactly. <STOP> <START> Wayne? <STOP> <START> Dan. <STOP> <START> How did youse acquires this knowledge? <START> You remember when I took Angie down Disney? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Was having drinks in a bar by Cape Canaveral and heard some cadets talking. <STOP> <START> Space cadets? <STOP> <START> Don't fuckin' piss me off, Dary. <STOP> <START> Isn't Cape Canaverals a ways away from Disney? <STOP> <START> It's not that far. <STOP> <START> Okay. <START> You're having a drinks in Capes Canaverals and you overhear some cadets talk something about mixing a batch ups in space? <STOP> <START> Did I stutter? <STOP> <START> Crazier things have happened, I guess. <STOP> <START> Was Bondars there? <STOP> <START> Roberta? <START> Yeah, Robertas Bondars, neuroscientist, Canada's first female astronauts. <STOP> <START> Fucking legend, Robertas Bondars. <START> Yeah, Bondar was there. <STOP> <START> Nice. <STOP> <START> What about the other guy, um, what's his name? <STOP> <START> He just left, apparently. <STOP> <START> Wow, rubbing shoulders with North America's finest space cadets. <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Bondar hammered? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No, I seen her crash a few Old Fashioneds, but she was actually sitting in a quiet corner by herself. <STOP> <START> Wonder why the other guys left. <STOP> <START> I don't have that information, Dan. <STOP> <START> Can you imagine if North America's finest space cadets went ups into outer space togethers? <STOP> <START> Oh, they did. <STOP> <START> They dids? <START> Yup. <STOP> <START> Houston wanted them to go up there together again, too. <STOP> <START> Bondar didn't wanna. <STOP> <START> Why nots? <STOP> <START> I don't think you wanna know. <STOP> <START> Well, sures, we dos. <STOP> <START> Look, youse didn't hear this from me, all right? <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> Dary, all right? <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> Look, a lot of people don't know this, but those two weren't just North America's finest spacemen, they were actually planet Earth's finest space people. <STOP> <START> So, of course, Houston wanted them up there together as much as possible. <STOP> <START> But they only went up theres togethers the one time? <START> Yep. 'Cause Bondars didn't wants to go up theres with him agains. <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> So, like, he was as a bit of a guy's guy around Kennedy Center. <START> You know, he played pranks and stuff, and they'd just say, Well, that's just him. <STOP> <START> Of course, Bondar was the more senior spaceman, had a bit of a reputation for, like, kicking it oldschool. <STOP> <START> Hence, the Old Fashioneds. <STOP> <START> So she didn't have a lot of time for the whole boyswillbeboys mentality. 'Kay. <STOP> <START> So, they finally shoehorned them up there together, knowin' full well it was oil and water. <STOP> <START> And I guess you can say he proved them right. <STOP> <START> Those space cadets really tell tales out of school, eh? <START> Yep. <STOP> <START> What happened next? <STOP> <START> So, each spaceman's got a space cam in their quarters which are connected to the other spacemen's quarters, as well as the main shuttle bay and the saucer section, the two smaller bays and the stardrive section. <STOP> <START> They'd be connected to the main bridge? <STOP> <START> Of course, they are, Dary. <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> So, we're talking about an elite vessel here? <STOP> <START> NASA'd never send a ship up there if it wasn't galaxy class. <START> You bet they wouldn't. <STOP> <START> Same with Elon Musk, but apparently Russia does it all the time. <STOP> <START> Fucking joke star fleet. <STOP> <START> So, what happened next? <STOP> <START> So, Bondar'd be up in Alpha quadrant, keeping the Captain's log, likely, of the events. <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And they'd all just come out of a <START> Yeager loop, so she was a bit worn out. <START> Yeah, she wouldn't be at full bars. <STOP> <START> But, of course, there's Bondar still up there in Alpha, keeping an eye out for wormholes and what not. <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> I guess there he'd be down there in Beta quadrant, floating around in space quarters, which Bondar could see, so could Houston. <STOP> <START> I guess what he'd do is float offcamera, pull his space pants down, grab his junk in a bunch in his hands. <STOP> <START> Like dinkerball? <STOP> <START> Sake, Dary. <STOP> <START> This is hard enough to get through without you stopping all over his story, Dary. <STOP> <START> Sorry, good buddy. <STOP> <START> So, there he'd be floating off camera. <STOP> <START> I guess what he'd do. <STOP> <START> Allegedlys. .according to the cadets, is dip just his junk back into frame. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Apparently did it all the time. <STOP> <START> Where's Houston in all this? <STOP> <START> Houston thought it was hilarious. <STOP> <START> But Bondar didn't? <STOP> <START> Nope. <STOP> <START> Bondar did not. <STOP> <START> Jesus Christ. <STOP> <START> I guess then what he'd do is he'd get on his comms. <STOP> <START> Allegedlys. <STOP> <START> Just telling you what the cadets told me. <STOP> <START> He'd go like, Hey, Bondar, check out space cam six. <STOP> <START> No. <START> Yep. <STOP> <START> She report him? <STOP> <START> Oh, she reported it. <STOP> <START> Did they slap sanctions on him? <START> Yeah. <START> Yeah, he got jacked up. <STOP> <START> Good for Houstons. <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <STOP> <START> Of course, they were still supposed to be up there another two months together, and things only got worse. <STOP> <START> How? <STOP> <START> Remember what I was saying about the cone? <START> Yeah? <STOP> <START> I guess whenever it was Bondar's turn to clean Beta quadrant, he would routinely batch and not cone it. <STOP> <START> Inexcusables! <STOP> <START> I ain't Bondar to tell you that's an understatement. <STOP> <START> I think she would, too. <STOP> <START> No, she never expected to be floating around some spaceman's quarters trying to catch airborne ejaculate in a plastic vacuum bag when she signed up for space camp. <STOP> <START> No, they only tell you about omega particles at space camp. <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <STOP> <START> This went on for two more months? <STOP> <START> Oh, no way, Dan. <STOP> <START> Oh, you better believe Houston aborted the mission. <STOP> <START> Bondar had strict orders to Picard Maneuver and warp 10 home. <STOP> <START> How many light years away were they? <STOP> <START> I was gonna ask, but then the cadets would know I was eavesdropping, so. <STOP> <START> Then what happened? <STOP> <START> They bring Bondar in for topsecret meeting, airtight boardroom, patdown, spawn entry, no cell phones inside and they said, Well, what do you wanna do here, Bondar? <STOP> <START> Lets him have it. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No? <STOP> <START> No. <START> You remember how I said she's oldschool. <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Bondar says to him, she says, I'm gonna be down at the bar drinking Old Fashioneds. <STOP> <START> That guy's gonna get what's coming to him. <STOP> <START> Fucking buzzed herself out of the boardroom. <STOP> <START> Dids he? <STOP> <START> Well, Dan, one of them's up in space doing space activities, the other one's at a bar by Disney drinking Old Fashioneds. <STOP> <START> That woman is the portrait of class. <STOP> <START> She always has been. <STOP> <START> God bless yas, Robertas Bondars. <STOP> <START> Now, you can't be especially sure those were even real space cadets at the bar by Kennedy that day on account of being so close to Disney. <STOP> <START> Could have just been playing pretend or cosplaying, like so many in that area like to do. <STOP> <START> But if there weren't over there spinning the yarn, fucking Bondar for Prime Minister, eh? <STOP> <START> Allo. <STOP> <START> Oui, hello. <STOP> <START> Do it. <STOP> <START> Bae, no. <STOP> <START> Oh, come on, we talked about this. <STOP> <START> I told you MariePierre had to see it, and now, she's here. <STOP> <START> All right. <START> Youse are sure you're laughing with me and not at me, eh? <STOP> <START> Absolutely not. <STOP> <START> Good enough. <STOP> <START> Is Katy there? <STOP> <START> Sup? <STOP> <START> Sup? <STOP> <START> Can you hold the camera for us? <STOP> <START> Sure. <STOP> <START> Oh, 'cause he's gonna do that thing for that second verse, right? <START> Yup, the thing for the second verse is why we're here, lady. <STOP> <START> Gotcha. <STOP> <START> Ah, youse the luckiest. <STOP> <START> Caught me halfcaught here, fuck. <STOP> <START> All right, here goes. <STOP> <START> Oh! <STOP> <START> Bye!. <STOP> <START> Things we do for love, eh, big brother?

<STOP> <START> I'd have a beer. <STOP> <START> Atta boy. <STOP> <START> What's the matter, Dary? <STOP> <START> I just. <STOP> <START> I haven't talked to Anik in a bit. <STOP> <START> I haven't seen Aniks in a fortnight. <STOP> <START> A fortnight?
