Your sister heard an old favorite on the radio the other day. You know what I heard on the radio today who I haven't heard from in a really long time but lowkey love? Radio? Oh, so you were here when I said that then. Which radio? The one in the fuckin' truck. Are you being goofy right now? So, terrestrials radios! All right. Yeah. So you're being goofy right now. No, it's just I don't knows too many peoples who still listens to terrestrials radios. You've ceased mingling with the peasants then, hey, Dan? Internet radios, satellite radios and podcasters is far more populars these days. What do youse listen to? My Favorite Murder podcast. Taggart and Torrens podcast. Stern. Ah, Stern's fuckin' sexy. Most peoples just don't listen to terrestrials radio. Internet radios and satellite radios have become far superior. So, if Howard Stern's type of radio is better than terrestrial radio, would Howard Stern's type be. Extraterrestrial?. Extraterrestrial. Fuck you, Dary. Guess who I heard on terrestrial radio who I haven't heard from in a really long time but lowkey love? Who was it? DMX. Fuckin' A. You like him, too? Sure I do. Why? Well, because he's an animal lover. How do youse knows he's an animal lover? Well, on account of him always barkin' like a dog in his songs. See, that's why I lowkey love him. He just, he sounds so tough when he goes arf, arf at the end of a rap. How's that go, Katy? Arf, arf. I see. So, arf, arf. What the fuck was that? What's the problem? If DMX was here right now, he'd hoof you right in the nuts. I think DMX would assume Dary'd already been hoofed in the nuts. Yeah. I mean, you might as well make a cat sound at the end of a tough guy line. Well, how'd that go, Katy? Meow! No, but put some threatening rap music lyrics in front of it like DMX would. Okay. I'm clickclackin' and rack stackin', bitches know I'm packin', I'm the trillist. Meow! See? I see. It's not the same thing. Nope. No animal sound would have the same effect as a dog barking if you're tryin' to sound tough with rap music lyrics. Not one. Maybe it coulds. Okay, Dan. Dan, okay. Okay, Dan. Let's put it to the test. Ahem. Uh. It's the jumpoff. Rockin' in my Tims. I'm the greatest. Get shook. Baa! Nope. This is America. Put the Benjamin's in the bag, bitch. Hoes in the trap, laid back in the 'Lac, I'm a don.

Just checking. Bye. Don't do that, bud. What? Ask your gal privately, but publicly, Are you okay? Well, I was just making sure. Yeah, you don't wanna get too needy with a gal like that, Dary. A gal like what? A gal who is, respectfully, super, super, super fuckin' hot. She's Victoria Secrets hot, there, good buddys. She's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition hot, Dary. Well, yeah. All the more reason to make sure she's okay. Well, don't say we didn't warn ya. How's the day? Longest day of the year. Summer solsticks. And you know what that means. Century Club! A hundred shots of beer in a hundred minutes will buckle ya if you don't have a strategy. Let me just call the girlfriend and, uh, make sure it's okay with le ol' boule et chaine. Put your phone down, Dary. And fuckin' stomp on it. You try dating a French girl. Yeah, give it a shot, bud. 'Kay. Today on the summer solstice we honor the time good ol' Uncle Eddie got the worst sunburn this side of Sasky, thus having to spend the longest day of the year inside, drinkin' the bar down. Well, I'm not carrying Dan home from the bar this time. That was youse? Well. Who's in? The skids are sober, so they're out. And I don't know, I haven't heard from Reilly and Jonesy. McMurrays? Yeah, they'll be there. Mrs. McMurray tried to arrange some sort of predrink on Facebook. Which is really counterproductive for the Century Club. Also, fuck Facebook. You'll wanna avoid McMurray today. Is that possible? Why? Well, it is the Century Club, so he'll be shitfaced. And when McMurray gets shitfaced, things come out of him that are. Offputting. Like what? No. This one's best left parked. Well, now I'm just super curious. No, just. Just lets sleepin' dogs lies. Yeah, yeah, and don't kick a dead horse. Yeah, stay away from him today. Actually, stay away from him when he's shitfaced any time. You do realize you're driving us straight to him, right? Can confirm. Well, I got the ebrake on so. Better let it out. Can't control a French girl. Or a fuckin' bored one. 'Sup? 'Sup? We'll find out about it anyway. Look, here's the scoop and I'm gonna tell you. When McMurray gets shitfaced, he likes to recount stories from his boys' trips. He still goes on boys' trips and he's married? Grow up. Yeah, he says things that are, mmm. Spit it out. Shoot. Just the worst fuckin' things you've ever heards in your entire lives. This I promise youse. Thank you, Squirrelly Dan. MARIE My brother was a hockey player, all my cousins, too. I grew up with boys. The worst kind. So just try me. Samezies. All right. If we're goin' in, we're goin' in. We ain't stopping till the job's done. I should've packed a lunch for this. And final warning, this one is best left unpacked. Once we start you're gonna want us to stop. But we're not gonna stop. Prove it. You guys should do it in your McMurray's voice. Also keep your jaws clenched like he does when he's all shitfaced. You know, for its effects. Any time now. Buckles up. Wayne, how would youse like to talk about cunt? Hey, Dary, are you an ass man, a tits man, or a cunt man? Hey, you ever fucked a couple of tasties at the same time? Oh. Fucked so many tasties. They used to tell me, Hey, you wanna taste it? They used to say, Come on, big boy, wanna jam a little bit of a taste? I go down to Vegas with about 17 buddies every single year and you never seen so much cunt in your life. Ew! Hard Rock rooftop, poolside villas. I ain't never seen so much cunt in my life. Anybody tell ya they seen more cunt then that's a liar! I used to fuck so many tasties. Where is Mrs. McMurray in all this? We's don't ask those kinds of questions. I'll tell ya, the last time we were down there, we made a little hashtag so the boys could keep track of each other. Why don't you go ahead and search hashtag MashTheGash2018. The year before it was hashtag SlitSlam2017. Oh. They were just the tastiest little slits you've ever seen. You never seen a gash so tasty. You know what, Bobby, Jim Dandy, you're gonna lose a digit in that sort of snapper.

That's a keeper if there ever was one, eh, good buddy?. Katy? But the McMurray's are part of the lifestyle so don't they just do that kind of shit together? I mean, they seem so in love. Different strokes for different folks, Miss Katys. I don't think Mrs. McMurray knows about this. It's none of our beeswax, Miss Katy. And she oughtta. That's none of your beeswax, Miss Katy.
