<START> You were trying to figure out WTF. with your BFFs the other day. <START> You guys ever sexted? <START> No All the times. <START> Do you really? <START> Daily. <START> I'm a bit surprised at you, Squirrely Dan. <START> It's all above water, I assure's you. <START> I'm on a telephone application's called Bumble. <START> It's kind of like Tinder except only the women's can initiate conversations. <START> So, what, they just message you up on your telephone to sex talk? <START> Sex text. <START> Correct. <START> Terrific. <START> I think I've been sexting with a gal, but not too sure. <START> Well, what did she sext ya? <START> LOL. <START> What did you sext her directly before that? <START> Well, I asked her if she wanted to go on a date. <START> That's not sexting. <START> Sure's it is. <START> No, it isn't. <START> Dary asked a gal to go on the date and she texted back LOL's. <START> Yes, so it appears as though that's what went down, Squirrely Dan. <START> Well, that means, "Lots of love". <START> No it doesn't. <START> Sure's it does. <START> No it doesn't. <START> LOL means, "Laughing out loud". <START> So? <START> So one of two things, super chief. <START> Number A, she thinks the very thought of going on a date with you is laughable. <START> Or number B, the fact that you'd think she'd want to go on a date with you is laughable. <START> Either way you're hooped. <START> So? <START> So she's laughing at you, bud. <START> So it's.not sexting? <START> Figure it out. <START> Maybe she meant, "Lots of load". <START> You wanna know what? <START> That's the problem with sexting and texting or technology in general. <START> The world needs less Facebook and more facetoface. <START> More than a bit fuckin' embarrassing, we're all sitting around here trying decipher what three letters might mean. <START> I'm sensing a bit of hostility here, big shoots. <START> Wanna know how my Uncle Ed met my Aunt Mary? <START> Walked right up to her, like a sock hop. <START> Told her he thought she was pretty. <START> Uncle Eddie's was a legend. <START> Aunt Marian, too. <START> Then he asked her if she wanted to dance with him. <START> Like, if she wanted to twist. <START> I bet you he swingdanced her. <START> Before he ballroomed 'er. <START> And she walks over to her gal pals and they're all saying, "How about the balls on this sailor. <START> Walks right up to a pretty girl like you asking for a twist."
