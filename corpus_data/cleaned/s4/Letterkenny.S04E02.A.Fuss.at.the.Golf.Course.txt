<START> One of your dogs was being a degen the other day. <START> What's up, what's up. <START> Don't let the dog lick your boot. <START> Off you go. <START> Way y'go. <START> Way y'go. <START> Way y'go. <START> What's the problem? <START> Your boots are covered in piss. <START> Are you accusing me of washing my boots in the toilet again? <START> All dudes' shoes are covered in piss. <START> From standin' in front of the toilet or a urinal. <START> Your stream hits the water or the porcelain and it goes fuckin' everywhere. <START> Prove it. <START> No, he's right. <START> Have you ever taken a look at the area half a foot in fronts of a urinal? <START> It's like a miniature swamps. <START> Ants could ride seadoos through it. <START> Ants can't ride no seadoos. <START> Of course ants can't ride no seadoos! <START> Just don't let the dog lick your boots. <START> I mean not to be an expert on the subject, 'cause of course, everybody's a fuckin' expert. <START> Everybody's a fuckin' expert. <START> Must be nice. <START> You know, when I was coming up we'd be lucky to even have a dog. <START> Now everyone's a fuckin' expert. <START> Must be nice. <START> You guys notice that whenever there's a problem everybody turns into a dog expert? <START> We oughtta leave this world behind. <START> Maybe they could. <START> Maybe who could? <START> Ants. <START> Could what? <START> Ride seadoos. <START> Good buddy? <START> See, there's a lot of variables at play here, obviously. <START> But if you ask me if I've heard crazier things than ants riding seadoos. <START> I'd say sure. <START> You'd need a scientist. <START> You'd need a team of scientists, I think. <START> Well, ants are smart enough to walk single file and protect their queen. <START> So, you know, they're just a stone's throw away from humans intelligencewise. <START> They're a hop, skip and a jump, if you really think about it. <START> You get a scientist to make a seadoo for an ant? <START> Well, I think a team of scientists, a good one, for sure could. <START> A scientist making seadoos for ants would be a tireless job. <START> Thankless, likely, too. <START> Well, you operates the gas with your thumb on the seadoo so, ants don't got thumbs. <START> That right there is your first obstacles. <START> No, you'd have to get scientists to make the gas a push button so the ant could just put his foot on it. <START> It's like if a team of scientists was building a seadoo for an ant, they could likely just as easily build the ant a bionic thumb to operate the gas with. <START> So, there's options there. <START> Yeah. <START> Ant would need a license to operate a personal watercraft. <START> That's not a big deal. <START> You can get that over the weekend. <START> But the scientists would have to build them a PFD because they wouldn't let them take the course without it. <START> Ants would have no problem stabilizing themselves out on the seadoo on accounts that they got more arms and legs than we do. <START> They've got a leg up on us there, if you wants to be clever about it. <START> If I'm an ant I'm operating the seadoo with my antennas. <START> That way I've got all those arms and legs to stabilize myself on the machine, which you'd need like, if it's a wavy day on the water. <START> It'd still take a lot of concentration from an ant. <START> Like Dan's gonna fall off two or three times when he gets going. <START> So it's just trial and error. <START> I don't know. <START> You don't know what? <START> Well, think about Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. <START> Think about how helpful and resilient the ant was the entire journey. <START> Well, know what, I'm just gonna come right out and say it, the kids might never have got unshrunk if it weren't for the ant. <START> That's all well and good, but I'm actually quite surprised you guys would suggest that the ants would just up and abandon his post protecting the queen to go ride on seadoos. <START> Well, you don't know that ant, Dan. <START> You know nothing about the ant, Dan. <START> That's rather presumptuous of youse. <START> You're an ant comin' up in a tough neighbourhood. <START> Never caught a break in your life. <START> All of a sudden there's a team of scientists outside your door with a seadoo. <START> Dan, look me in the eye right now and tell me you don't ride it. <START> The ant's buddies would be thrilled to help him out. <START> They'd happily cover his shift protecting the queen. <START> An opportunity like that? <START> They'd be linin' up around the anthill. <START> How many more opportunities like that you think the ant's going to get? <START> Not many. <START> That's the first ant in the colony to ride a seadoo. <START> That's his legacy. <START> They'd be talking about that ant intercolonial. <START> Fire ants wouldn't fuck with him. <START> He rides seadoos. <START> What's the alternative? <START> Yeah, what's the alternative? <START> Work on an ant farm? <START> That ant's got a life on the outside, he's got to live it God dammit. <START> His hours might have got cut. <START> He might have mouths to feed. <START> You don't know. <START> His wife's thinking about leaving, taking the kids too. <START> I was out of line. <START> Well, good people make mistakes, Dan. <START> Yeah, it's all right. <START> Just. just like, I don't know, like, down the road, I think, if you hear somebody talkin' about somebody that they don't really know, you'll swiftly correct them. <START> I think it's important that they just learn something here. <START> Not to be an expert, 'cause everybody's a fuckin' expert. <START> Must be nice. <START> Can you get me some sour candies? <START> Sure, KatyKat. <START> You got him well trained, don't ya? <START> Wayne, how'r ya now. <START> Not s'bad. <START> Good 'n you? <START> Now. now hold on, Wayne, Wayne. <START> Wayne, we aint' got time for the pleasantries, all right? <START> Youse guys heard what the hockey coach is up to at the golf course? <START> Fuck golf. <START> Fuckin' ankle sock wearin' sallies, that's all I know. <START> That fuckin' twat says there's too much shits from Canada Gooses on the golf course. <START> There's too much shit from Canada Gooses everywhere. <START> Just keep your dog out of it and keep walkin'. <START> Exactly. <START> But get this. <START> To curb the amount of shits from Canada Gooses, that degenerate sonofabitch has put the wheels in motion to oil and grease up the eggs! <START> Hot Jimmy! <START> What the fuck ya talkin' about oil and grease up the eggs? <START> They track down the Canada Gooses nests, put oil on Canada Gooses eggs so they won't hatch. <START> Oh!  What?! <START> So mother Canada Gooses sit on their eggs and wait diligently for them to Hatch, but they never hatch. <START> Canada Gooseslings die inside the egg. <START> What?! <START> What?! <START> What?! <START> What?! <START> I've never been so irate in my whole fuckin' life! <START> You fuck with mother nature! <START> You don't fuck with it, cocksucker. <START> You don't fuck with motherhood! <START> There's a special place in heaven for animal lovers, that's all I know. <START> Those are fuckin' Canada Gooses. <START> Those are Canada's fuckin' gooses. <START> Canada Gooses are majestics. <START> Barrelchested. <START> The envys of all ornithologys. <START> They are leaders. <START> Born and bred leaders. <START> Canada Gooses are vanfuckin'garde. <START> Avantfuckin'garde. <START> Guardians of the fuckin' galaxy! <START> You wanna know what?

<START> We oughtta leave this world behind. <START> Canada Gooses mate for life. <START> They're just like you and me. <START> Those cocksuckers help each other fly when they're in the air. <START> They look out for each other. <START> Now you wanna kill them for takin' shits. <START> You know, I saw two Canada Gooses mount a swan one time and you gotta think that swan told her friends about it. <START> You're goddamn right she did. <START> I think we all need to take a good look in the mirror and ask ourselves, where we would be without Canada Gooses. <START> We cannot allows this to happen. <START> We will not allow this to happen. <START> I'm about ready to put some anthrax in the fuckin' mail here, that's all I know. ooh! <START> Settle down, baby. <START> Settle down. <START> Hey! <START> Let's hit the golf course! <START> Hey. <START> Hey, buddy. <START> Oh, hey, buddy. <START> You, uh, throwin' some weights around, eh?

And how do you thinks Evil Knievel's made all them dare devil jumps there, shitty John Daleys, Canada Gooses. <START> Letting them into their jet streams, that's how. <START> That. that is not true. <START> The same thing goes for Evil Knievel Junior and Travis Pastrana. <START> They owe everything they have to Canada Gooses. <START> It's not true!  And most people don't know this but Canada Gooses were the deciding factor in the 1995 Quebec referendum. <START> They kept this country together.
