<START> One of your dogs was being a degen the other day. <STOP> <START> What's up, what's up. <STOP> <START> Don't let the dog lick your boot. <START> Off you go. <STOP> <START> Way y'go. <STOP> <START> Way y'go. <STOP> <START> Way y'go. <STOP> <START> What's the problem? <STOP> <START> Your boots are covered in piss. <STOP> <START> Are you accusing me of washing my boots in the toilet again? <STOP> <START> All dudes' shoes are covered in piss. <STOP> <START> From standin' in front of the toilet or a urinal. <STOP> <START> Your stream hits the water or the porcelain and it goes fuckin' everywhere. <STOP> <START> Prove it. <STOP> <START> No, he's right. <STOP> <START> Have you ever taken a look at the area half a foot in fronts of a urinal? <STOP> <START> It's like a miniature swamps. <STOP> <START> Ants could ride seadoos through it. <STOP> <START> Ants can't ride no seadoos. <START> Of course ants can't ride no seadoos! <STOP> <START> Just don't let the dog lick your boots. <STOP> <START> I mean not to be an expert on the subject, 'cause of course, everybody's a fuckin' expert. <STOP> <START> Everybody's a fuckin' expert. <STOP> <START> Must be nice. <STOP> <START> You know, when I was coming up we'd be lucky to even have a dog. <STOP> <START> Now everyone's a fuckin' expert. <STOP> <START> Must be nice. <STOP> <START> You guys notice that whenever there's a problem everybody turns into a dog expert? <STOP> <START> We oughtta leave this world behind. <STOP> <START> Maybe they could. <STOP> <START> Maybe who could? <STOP> <START> Ants. <STOP> <START> Could what? <STOP> <START> Ride seadoos. <STOP> <START> Good buddy? <STOP> <START> See, there's a lot of variables at play here, obviously. <STOP> <START> But if you ask me if I've heard crazier things than ants riding seadoos. <STOP> <START> I'd say sure. <STOP> <START> You'd need a scientist. <STOP> <START> You'd need a team of scientists, I think. <STOP> <START> Well, ants are smart enough to walk single file and protect their queen. <STOP> <START> So, you know, they're just a stone's throw away from humans intelligencewise. <STOP> <START> They're a hop, skip and a jump, if you really think about it. <STOP> <START> You get a scientist to make a seadoo for an ant? <STOP> <START> Well, I think a team of scientists, a good one, for sure could. <STOP> <START> A scientist making seadoos for ants would be a tireless job. <STOP> <START> Thankless, likely, too. <STOP> <START> Well, you operates the gas with your thumb on the seadoo so, ants don't got thumbs. <STOP> <START> That right there is your first obstacles. <STOP> <START> No, you'd have to get scientists to make the gas a push button so the ant could just put his foot on it. <STOP> <START> It's like if a team of scientists was building a seadoo for an ant, they could likely just as easily build the ant a bionic thumb to operate the gas with. <STOP> <START> So, there's options there. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Ant would need a license to operate a personal watercraft. <STOP> <START> That's not a big deal. <STOP> <START> You can get that over the weekend. <STOP> <START> But the scientists would have to build them a PFD because they wouldn't let them take the course without it. <STOP> <START> Ants would have no problem stabilizing themselves out on the seadoo on accounts that they got more arms and legs than we do. <STOP> <START> They've got a leg up on us there, if you wants to be clever about it. <STOP> <START> If I'm an ant I'm operating the seadoo with my antennas. <STOP> <START> That way I've got all those arms and legs to stabilize myself on the machine, which you'd need like, if it's a wavy day on the water. <STOP> <START> It'd still take a lot of concentration from an ant. <STOP> <START> Like Dan's gonna fall off two or three times when he gets going. <STOP> <START> So it's just trial and error. <STOP> <START> I don't know. <STOP> <START> You don't know what? <STOP> <START> Well, think about Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. <STOP> <START> Think about how helpful and resilient the ant was the entire journey. <STOP> <START> Well, know what, I'm just gonna come right out and say it, the kids might never have got unshrunk if it weren't for the ant. <STOP> <START> That's all well and good, but I'm actually quite surprised you guys would suggest that the ants would just up and abandon his post protecting the queen to go ride on seadoos. <STOP> <START> Well, you don't know that ant, Dan. <STOP> <START> You know nothing about the ant, Dan. <STOP> <START> That's rather presumptuous of youse. <STOP> <START> You're an ant comin' up in a tough neighbourhood. <STOP> <START> Never caught a break in your life. <STOP> <START> All of a sudden there's a team of scientists outside your door with a seadoo. <STOP> <START> Dan, look me in the eye right now and tell me you don't ride it. <STOP> <START> The ant's buddies would be thrilled to help him out. <STOP> <START> They'd happily cover his shift protecting the queen. <STOP> <START> An opportunity like that? <STOP> <START> They'd be linin' up around the anthill. <STOP> <START> How many more opportunities like that you think the ant's going to get? <STOP> <START> Not many. <STOP> <START> That's the first ant in the colony to ride a seadoo. <STOP> <START> That's his legacy. <STOP> <START> They'd be talking about that ant intercolonial. <STOP> <START> Fire ants wouldn't fuck with him. <STOP> <START> He rides seadoos. <STOP> <START> What's the alternative? <STOP> <START> Yeah, what's the alternative? <STOP> <START> Work on an ant farm? <STOP> <START> That ant's got a life on the outside, he's got to live it God dammit. <STOP> <START> His hours might have got cut. <STOP> <START> He might have mouths to feed. <STOP> <START> You don't know. <STOP> <START> His wife's thinking about leaving, taking the kids too. <STOP> <START> I was out of line. <STOP> <START> Well, good people make mistakes, Dan. <STOP> <START> Yeah, it's all right. <STOP> <START> Just. just like, I don't know, like, down the road, I think, if you hear somebody talkin' about somebody that they don't really know, you'll swiftly correct them. <STOP> <START> I think it's important that they just learn something here. <STOP> <START> Not to be an expert, 'cause everybody's a fuckin' expert. <STOP> <START> Must be nice. <STOP> <START> Can you get me some sour candies?
