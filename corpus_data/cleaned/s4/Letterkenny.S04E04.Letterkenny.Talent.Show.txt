<START> Or something similar. <START> Well, to be fair. <START> To be fair. <START> To be fair. <START> To be fair, it's likely pretty tough sledding up there, for a standup comedian. <START> That comedian was a joke. <START> Well that's a good one, big hos. <START> Thank yous. <START> Let me put it this way, okay, I was this close to making that standup comic a liedown comic. <START> I don't get it. <START> Well, I'm just saying that I was thinking about whoopin' his ass and so I imagined he would have been lying down had I done that. <START> Well, see there you go, point and proof you're up there trying to be funny like a nut sack, if nobody gets your shit, you're hooped like him. <START> So. <START> So can confirm it's pretty tough sleddin' up there for a standup comedian. <START> Ah, okay. <START> I get it. <START> Could use a little work. <START> Point for testdriving it though. <START> In any event. <START> In any event. <START> In any event, we should host our own talent show. <START> That's not a bad idea. <START> How're we gonna get the word out? <START> Ah, you can put it on your fuckin' Facebooks, likely. <START> And whos will be preforming at this events? <START> Who wouldn't, that's the question. <START> The fuck else is there to do around here. <START> Jimmy Dickens should host. <START> So we just need judges and a few more acts. <START> Well, I'll judge and so will he. <START> Why?. <START> Born to judge, bud. <START> All right. <START> There's our judges. <START> Now we just need a few more acts. <START> Would you be needing a joke smith for this esteems affair? 'Cause I've always wanted to try my hand at stands ups comedy. <START> And I've often wondered how those courageous souls makes it work. <START> Salt of the earth people, stand up comedians. <START> For the most part. <START> You're in. <START> That leaves you, Daryl. <START> Got any special talent you'd like to share with the class? <START> Oh, I don't know. <START> I'd be half scared to get up there. <START> That means you'd be half excited too. <START> Well, we could make first prize $100 bar tab at MoDean's if that colors the water any different for you. <START> He's in. <START> Good 'nuff. <START> Good 'nuff. <START> Good 'nuff. <START> Good 'nuff. <START> Good 'nuff. <START> Good 'nuff. <START> Good stuff. <START> Wayne? <START> Dary? <START> What'd you get me into? <START> It's time to get back on the horse, bud. <START> Oh, no. <START> No, I took that horse out the back side of the barn. <START> Put her down for good. <START> And for good reason. <START> Are you forgettin' where you come from? 'Cause it sounds to me like you're forgettin' where you come from. <START> Are you forgettin' your roots? <START> Your linedancing lineage is legendary. <START> You will find no finer liners, Dary. <START> Aunt Doreen made it to sectionals. <START> I was not given that gift. <START> Aunt Doreen could have gone to provincials. <START> Some say she could have gone to regionals. <START> If she had lived in the States, she would have gone to state. <START> Oh, how she'd have won state. <START> She'd a took state. <START> If it hadn't have been for. <START> She didn't have the. <START> If it weren't for the. .bum leg. <START> Buerger's disease. <START> Was it Buerger's? <START> Yes. <START> Buergers. <START> Didn't she get treated at the Mayo Clinic? <START> Yes. <START> She got her Buerger's treated with mayo. <START> Did she do that to ketchup to the competition? <START> Did she ketchup? <START> Yes. <START> And despite her Buerger's, she never beefed with anyone. <START> She relished a challenge. <START> That was a challenge that she relished. <START> Mustard up the courage. <START> She worked her buns off. <START> She worked the buns off her Buergers. <START> No cheesy moves. <START> Lettuce all be inspired by her. <START> She lettuce. <START> No hotdogging. <START> Just Beurgers. <START> The point is, if Aunt Doreen can do all that with a gouty gam, you sure as shit can line dance in Letterkenny. <START> I guess you're right. <START> If Aunt Doreen can do it with a shitty stick, then I can probably get up on stage at the talent show for Aunt Doreen. <START> The thing is, I just wished I had your guyses confidence. <START> Or Fred Astaire's. es. <START> Hey, guys, I was over at Gailers. <START> How's Gailer?
