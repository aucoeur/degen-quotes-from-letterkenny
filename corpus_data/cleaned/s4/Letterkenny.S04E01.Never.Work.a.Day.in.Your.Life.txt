Your gal has a cousin who's spun and she is no longer your hun. 'Cause you had to pop'em and boy did you drop 'em. Yeah, you did what had to be done. Came to you after having a bar fight. Felt like you got hit by a car, right? But your pal had your back, went on the attack, but it turned off his gal like a night light. That Godfearing sackofshit, Bradley, came in and he fucked up so badly, that your brother stepped in, which his gal calls a sin, but, I'd do the same fucking gladly. Well, you're not really sure as what went down. But you hears you look like a real clown. Your pal had a scrap like a real proper snap. And since he's been wearing a frown. Katie chose me over Jonesy, I don't like that he's all alonesy. But I'm getting laid, I don't hate that trade, I just wish that she had a clonesy. Katy cat dumped me for Reilly. It sucks, may put it dryly. He's getting laid, and I can live with that trade. It's just kinda tough to be smiley. Been hoovering bombers and rips, eating zoomers and taking mad dips. There's no end in sight, but I am on an apt flight, so fuck off with all your guilttrips! The Church said, "No more" to my teachings. Been filling the void with street preachings. I'm out in the rain, and I haven't seen Wayne. Us together is not too farreaching. Wayne knocked out Bradley, and I'll say, through that bullshit, Rosie won't stay. It sucks for me cause there's no guarantee I'll see either of them on my birthday. It's been two months since Rosie went packing. And sure, your love life has been lacking. But a friend backs a friend, and on that, you don't bend. She's onwards and upwards. Get cracking. Gail's birthday party tonight at MoDeans two. MoDeans two. MoDeans two. You want MoDeans two around over there, Wayne? MoDeans two must choring to do. How about a little bit of MoDeans togetherness? Now no needs to fight MoDeans tooth and nails over. Good thing I'm getting good at MoDeans tootin' out the negativity. Oh, quit MoDeans tooting your own horn there, Wayne. Why don't you quit being such a MoDeans tool over there, Daryl? All right, let's put this fight to the MoDeans tomb. Good. There's always MoDeans tomorrow. Well, MoDeans to be fair.  To be fairs, now it seems like you're doing all this work to distract yourself from feelings you don't wants to be dealing with. Get real. It's a lot of work, Wayne. Well, do what you love, and you'll never work a day in your life. Stormy comes out of the barns yet? Hey, boys. Did you miss me? Anyone ever tell you what an asshole you look like? You're a complete fucking flop, bud. Pull your finger out of your ass, you fucking pipe fitter. I'd rather be watching a hobo jerk off. I think we'd be lucky a hobo jerk off right now. I'd rather watch a paper cut in slowmo. I'd rather be watching a tenman lemon party on an IMAX movie screen. Don't let grammy google that one. You know what, you'd be my grammy's soulmate, cupcake. You're bumfluff, buds. Sing a song or something. Do a trick. You're useless. What's your laundryfolding channel, hun? I bet you know exactly how many days it is until Christmas, don't you, bud? Wait! What? Go fuck yourself, you silly fucking buttcrusty. You're a Danish in a donut shop. You're a cup of baby carrots, you fucking asshole. Where's your kittypetting partner there, pussy? I don't even know what your name is, bud. My friend's name is Jonesy and my... Reilly, get in the house. Well... back to choring. Yeah, I do kind of wonder what that other nutsack's been up to. Who brought the rocket, boys? Those billet brother's a fucking rocket boys. Wanna watch me shoot for my point, bud? I got a stick he can handle. No penalty for hair pulling in this game. I'd check you from behind. Let's play dirty snipe. Let's muck it up. Different kind of headshots over here, bud. Don't need a Conky to enter my dark room, rocket. We love stick swinging, boys. How about a quick poke check? I love a good spear in the slot room. You like a long twig or a short twig? I'll show you an illegal curve. Lay some skin, Mark. Coming right up, Dax. I miss my buddy. I'll be your buddy. I'll be your buddy. What are we even doing here? How are you now?  Good. And you? Then tell it to your face. Okay. Sure is nice to have a break from choring. Thanks for the help. If it's good for the goose, it's good for the gander. Well, more hands make less work. Yeah, but, it's a lot of work, Wayne. Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life. So, Stormy wouldn't come out of the barn this morning to eat her breakfast. Wouldn't even touch it till I moved inside. You should try to mix some Vitamin D in there too, because likely she hasn't been getting enough from the sunlight. Naturally, and what not. Well, like that's what I think a vet would say. Yeah, I really do feel like the vet might say that. You know the only other dog Stormy's ever taken to is Rosie's stud Seado. Now, he is such a good boy. Oh, he's a good boy. Who's a good boy? Yes, he is such a boy. Well, then do it for Stormy. She's such a good girl. Oh, what a good girl. Who's a good girl? Yeah, she is such a little girlie. Plus, Stormy and Seado did have the most beautiful litter we've ever had. Who's a good little puppy? Who's a little puppy? So little. Where's her belly? That little puppy. Now who wants a little itchings and a scratchings? You're just a little puppy with your little belly. I see you, little puppy. Who wants the scratches on their bellies? You wants the scratches on their bellies.. Who likes a little itchings and scratchings behind their ears? So, it's settled. I'll give Rosie a call, tell her to bring over Seado. Hard no. Too busy.. Back to choring. No! Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy. How're you doing, buddy? I'm good. Good. You look kind of bummed, buddy. Yeah. Kind of bummed, buddy? No, I'm just a bit lonely. But, I'm good, bro. You know, I'm so good, it's good. Yeah, totally. Yeah, good, dude. You know, I'm... I'm kinda bummed too. Yeah? It's just... Katy's always making me do stuff for her, and she's never hanging out with me. She's really busy, helping Wayne doing his stuff, and it's like... I'm good though. Dude, I'm also so good, bro. I'm so good. I'm so sick, bro! Bro! I'm super good! Good, bro! I'm so good. I am, dude. I'm having the best time. Having the best time. Ever. Nothing's wrong in my life. Best times. You good? Hey, Adam and Steve.  Stewart! I always support you. This is our place to dance. To disco. To get dirty. I'm not here to dance, heathen. Unless, well... Unless you ask me to, Roald. I'm here to street preach. After the church of spiritual humanism... Isn't it church of human spiritualism? No, isn't it the church of humanly spiritualists? The church of spiritual humanism formerly the church of spiritual humanism's science. Totally. Totally. After the church of spiritual humanism no longer required me to serve him under their roof, budget cuts, you know how that goes, I asked him to guide me to where I was needed. Him guided me to here. Rips. Rips? Ripsy do! Rips around a religious person? It's weird. Glen, this is where we do rips. Stewart, this is where I do revelations. What are you guys doing? Like we go to the gym and do reps? This is the area for rips. We just want to do reps. But we could all do revelations. We don't want to do revelations. Just reps. Want rips? No rips. Just reps. What about reps and revelations? Just reps! We cannot do rips and revelations. There will be no rips done in his presence! However, I can envision the scenario in which I'm doing revelations and you two are doing reps, and I'm watching, and I like it. Just reps! Just reps! Rips. Reps! Revelations! Rips! Reps! Revelations! Rips! Reps! Revelation! Hey!. Bonnie McMurray! I called the cops. Rips! Reps? Reps? Revelations. How are you now? Good, and you? Then, tell that to your face. You know, he's a shorthaired dog. You don't need to brush him twice a day. You know, you don't need to watch me brush him twice a day. Get a hobby. Get a kite. You know what? Take a fucking break from choring.. It's a lot of work, Wayne. Well, do what you love, and you'll never work another day in your life. Come on, Gus. He is such a good boy. That's just what he is.. If you never had to work another day in your life, what do you think you'd be doing?. That's a very good question, Derry. What would you do if you never had to work another day in your life? Well, pull on it, likely.. I was just thinking, I'd have plenty of times for batching.. We'd have so much time for mixing a batch.. I'd mix a hardy batch.. If I never had to work another day in my life, I'd be wailing on it.. Or just hammering on it.. It'd be like I was back in high school. beat my bread like it owes me money.. I'd mix more bats than Betty Crockers.. Play more horn than a trombone player.. You know, I used to have pole position in many a fivefinger race.. I've handled some shower stinkys.. Beats sitting around scratching crotch all day.. Or bust like Humpty Dumpty.. I'd carry bigger wads than Tony Soprano.. You know, we've been out weighing chores so much, I can't remember the last time I leaned into one.. Yeah.. Say, is there matinee game on, no?. What sport?. I don't know. Ball.. Yes. Yes, I do believe there's a game this afternoon. You see that movie Get Out yet? Twice. Good fucking movie. Did you hear they're making a Canadian version? No. Called Get out. Happy birthday, Gail. Thanks, Katy cat. Rosie, how are you now? Good, and you? Tell that to your face. Okay. What's cooking, goodlookin'? Stormy. She won't leave the barn. I heard. Seado hasn't been himself either. Dogs, am I right? It's a lot of work. Do what you love, and you'll never work a day in your life. Say, what would you do if you never had to work a day in your life? Read. I think I'll go do that now. Happy birthday, cousin. Bye, Katy. I'll tell you what I'd do. Shauna Gastonbrew? That, and... No, I meant for me. I'd diddle my skittle Oh? Till she spittles. For fuck's sakes. I'd flick my bean like a rousing game of ... for sexy results. I don't doubt it. I mean it. You haven't seen a climax like this since Karate Kid crane kick. Bye, Gail. I've wet more skin than a public pool. I've reached more peak than a sherpa. So you sure you don't wanna come with us to Gail's birthday party there, big sugar? Too much choring to do. See the wet wheel out of here. What's the frequency there, Kenneth? Stormy got a finger in the bum. Was it a... Twoknuckler. Like a horizontal knuckler? Hard no. That means that a twoknuckler... Can confirm. A person has two knuckles, okay? One, two. It's not knuckle. I asked. I asked the vet if that sort of person has two knuckles per finger. One, two. Okay? It's clinical. So, I don't wanna hear another word about it. Fuck.. Fair enough, good buddy. That might be something. What? Firing knuckles up animals bums all day. What do you mean? Well... that could be a lot of work. Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life. Wayne, how are you now? Good, and you? Then, tell... Tell that to your face. Yes, Katy, it's really funny how you keep saying that. What's the deal with Stormy? Physically, she's in ship shape. She's chiseled out of stone. The vet says that she's the healthiest German Shepherd she's ever seen. Vet like Shepherds. Oh, the vet love Shepherds. Shepherds are fucking lovable. So then, what's the problem? Vet said she might be depressed. Dogs get depressed? Get real! Well, then, you and Stormy make a fine pair of poopy pants then. Fly a kite, Katy. The only difference is that Stormy can't talk. I bet if she could talk, then she would tell us what's wrong so we could do something to fix it. You can talk. And it would be wise for you to use that luxury to tell the appropriate parties what's wrong so we can do something to fix it. Just some food for thought there, poopy pants. Hey, Seth. Hey, Seth! Fuck a duck. Super. You brought the fucking rocket, boys? Those Billet brothers are fucking rocket, boys? Let's play a little twoonone scheme. I'll play left, he'll play right, you fit in the middle. Ride the pine, we'll change onthefly. Let's find your neutral zones. I'd love to backcheck you, bud. It's a buttending clinic over here, boys. You make my stick hot. Get it? Come penetrate the slot, mister. You a good Dman? Sure, you're a good D. Man. Why don't you go up and lay me some of that skin, honey? Coming right up, Daxie. I miss my buddy. I'll be your buddy. I'll be your buddy. What're we even doing here? How are you now? Hail the Lord casteth Satan from the dollar storeth parking lot! And the Lord showedeth Satan no mercy. And the Lord casteth Satan into the deaths of the bowels of the pits of hell. Gentlemen. How goeth your revelations, Glen? Divine, Stewart. How goeth your rips? Celestial. There's no place for rips among revelations! Revelations haveth no place among rips! Then I believe we haveth our conclusion. That we doeth. Battle blitzkrieg. Conflict. Crash! Havoc! Hostility! War! War! How are you now? How are you now? Well, good, and you? Well, good, and you? Then tell that to your face. Then tell that to your face. What about Stormy? Not so good. Seado's been a pile, too. He's such a good boy. Yes, he is such a boy. You knocked out my cousin. My loyalty to my family will not be compromised. Your cousin knocked out my friends. My loyalty to them will not be compromised. Good enough. We're here for the dogs. Okay. Pitter patter. Bless her. Bradley? I'm at my second favorite cousin's birthday party and I don't see my favorite cousin or her dude, Wayne. Where you at? We're at Wayne's. Put me on speaker phone.. Yo, Wayne. Bradley. This ain't Biggie and Pac. Nobody dead, nobody dying. I knocked out Wayne's friends, you knocked me out. We squared off and did it the right way. There's got to be a winner, there's got to be a loser. Yo, Wayne, I couldn't do it the night up on account of being unconscious and shit. Good, scrap, my dude. Yeah, that was a pretty good scrap. Last time I checked, that's how shit gets done. You got a problem you can't solve with words, you throw hands. After that, it's finished. I got no problems with you, Wayne. I got no problem with you, Bradley. Actually, I got a lot of time for dudes like you. Good ol' boys are a dying breed. Good ol' boys gotta keep the good ol' boys that are alive. I agree. Good ol' boys are a dying breed. And you're funniest fucking guy I know, Bradley. I mean, seriously. What say, you two quit being fools this damn minute? Ain't got no time to waste on this planet. That's what's up. You know, the Little Bones game is tied over there right now. That's what's up. That's what's up. That's what's up. You're damn right, that's what's up. Now, get your asses down to my second favorite cousin's birthday party. Okay, everybody, and who wants a big happy birthday together!. Happy birthday to Gail! Whoo! Yeah. Relationships, it's a lot of work. Do what you love... And you'll never work a day in your life.
