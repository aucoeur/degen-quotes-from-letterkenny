'Cause that's a fight on sight for you and her new guy, buddy. <START> Fourth line for life, bro. <START> Maybe, if you'd ever been in a real fight, you might not be so keen for another. <START> What did you say? <START> You heard me. <START> Hold my spitter. <START> Darts off, boys. <START> You looking for a tilly, buddy? <START> Let's have a donnybrook. <START> Pump the brakes. <START> You take your shirt off, but leave your sunglasses on? <START> What sort of backwards fuckin' pageantry is that? <START> Do you want to fight with those shades or play pokerstars.com? <START> Hold my spitter. <START> Dude, I can't hold your spitter. <START> You're holding my spitter. <START> Just put the spitters down. <START> Ticktock. <START> Go time! <START> Go time! <START> Look at that fuckin' treasure trail. <START> What's up with your fuckin' body hair, big shoots. <START> You look like a 12yearold Dutch girl. <START> Your aesthetician quaff that for you?. <START> You can kiss my assthetician. <START> You guys do cross fit? <START> You can crossfuckoff. <START> Cross fart. <START> How many times you pulled your horn today, bud? <START> What? <START> Oh, she's bashful. <START> Oh, come on, kitten. <START> I won't tell anyone. <START> Ball park six to eight? <START> You're a fucking animal. <START> Play a little five on one. <START> Hit the kitchen, mix a batch. <START> Feed the ducks. <START> Distribute some free literature. <START> Go time! <START> Fuckin'. <START> Shed 'em! <START> Riley! <START> Jonesy! <START> Put your fuckin' shirts on! <START> Get outta here!. <START> This isn't over! <START> Jinx. <START> You owe me a Coke. <START> Never buy you a Coke. <START> It's a hard life pickin' stones and pullin' teats but sure as God's got sandals it beats fightin' dudes with treasure trails. <START> Hi, Katy. <START> We're out of yogurt. <START> I brought some from home. <START> So why didn't you stay there and eat it. <START> Mornin' Dary. <START> Mornin'. <START> Thank you. <START> Welcome. <START> So, you talked to <START> Angie yet? <START> It's been almost a month now. <START> Think you need to get back on the horse. <START> She stepped out on you. <START> Can't go back to that and get any respect. <START> Not in Letterkenny. <START> Wayne, <START> Angie did you a lot of good. <START> Somewhere along the way you kinda got soft. <START> You're not even fighting anymore. <START> You know what you need? <START> Sex. <START> With a girl. <START> Not just any girl. <START> A good Christian girl. <START> I think I can help you. <START> I've been going to the Burning Bush Youth Group every Sunday. <START> I think you should come with me. <START> I think you should just eat your yogurt. <START> There's millions of starving kids in the world. <START> Yeah? <START> Name ten. <START> You need a distraction. <START> Something fun. <START> Look at this. <START> It's called Tinder. <START> Look, see there's all these girls and if you don't like one, you just say nope and move onto the next. <START> But if you do like one, then you can see how close they are and I don't know, maybe meet up or whatever. <START> So if you like 'em you just type 'em out a message or what's the scoop? <START> Yeah. <START> You just, you know, say something like. <START> Like, "On a scale of one to <START> America, how free are you right now?" Oh, Jesus! <START> Look at these nut sacks. <START> Why do you hate them so much? 'Cause hockey players would grab a monkey by the tit if they could. <START> Smokes are for jokes, bud! <START> Put it out before it puts you out, bud! <START> Trash the ash, pal! <START> Ouch! <START> Put it out! <START> Put it out! <START> Put it out! <START> Put it out! <START> Tell the fish hook story, Dan. <START> It's really more of a Wayne story. <START> Yeah, but he won't tell it. <START> Oh, you've heard it a baker's dozen times. <START> Tell the story or he won't shut up. <START> Is there anymore trail mix? <START> It's in the house. <START> Yous makes the most delicious trail mix, Katy, and I got to say that's what I appreciates about you. <START> Is that what you appreciate about me? <START> Pitterpatter, squirrely Dan. <START> So, as the story goes, Wayne hucks an egg at a truck with a Confederate flag in the back windshield and the driver's fumin' pissed. <START> So, we flee the scene goin' full tilt like a Peterbilt, right? <START> Now, The Federales catch up to us and chase us through a few backyards before we scamper up into some trees and all Wayne's got on is a pair of cutoff jean shorts so he ain't exactly super jazzed about the situation, was you Wayne? <START> Oh, I'm no DJ Jazzy Jeff. <START> The Federale pulls out his Taser, and he points it up at Wayne and says some real Clint Eastwoodsounding shit. <START> He says to Wayne, he says, "If I'd known I was going to run into some uptown street toughs today, "I'd have done up my top button.". <START> That's from a John Wayne motion picture. <START> No, Cool Hand Luke. <START> Pert near anything Kevin Costner, really. <START> Either way, I's impressed and I'd let out an audible gasp so he hears me, spins around, aims the Taser up at me and lets fire, and if that thing doesn't latch onto my nipple ring, which I'm pretty sure amplified the electric current, he sent coursing through my entire body. <START> And they just walked over and yanked that thing out of my nipple like it was a goddamn fish hook. <START> At least that's according to my cousin. <START> Well, you know, my second cousin. <START> Who, Garrett? <START> No, Jarrett. <START> Huh. <START> I cried. <START> I'm not even ashamed to admit that. <START> That was well brought up. <START> Too bad you weren't. <START> I should say. <START> Thirsty Thursdays, boys. <START> Might as well get balls deep in a bottle of Gus'n Bru tonight. <START> It's a four leaf clover. <START> Make a wish. <START> Wish you weren't so fucking awkward, bud. <START> Is <START> Angie working?. <START> Better have a peeksee, Wayne. <START> How are yous?. <START> Not too bad. <START> Good. <START> And you? <START> Not too bad. <START> Smells like someone's in their barn clothes. <START> It's Dary. <START> Four shots of Gus'n Bru, please and thank you, One for you, too, Gailor. <START> Thank you, Wayne, but I'm off the sauce. <START> Taking eight vitamins a day now. <START> What are you taking? <START> I'm taking multivitamin, fish oil, vitamin C, vitamin D, two vitamin B complexes and two ColdFX's. <START> Yeah, but 'cept how many darts though? <START> Twenty, 25 darts. <START> Oh, you got 'er down then? <START> Last I seen ya, you were on a pack and a half of smokes. <START> Well, sometimes, I'll have a pack and a half of smokes, but never more than two packs of smokes. <START> Good enough. <START> All right. <START> Won't be rude. <START> I'd hang a piss. <START> Oh, fuck. <START> I'm about to give birth to a pound of fudge. <START> Wayne. <START> McMurray. <START> How're ya now? <START> Good 'n you? <START> Not so bad. <START> Seen <START> Angie, with her new dude? <START> What a fuckin' dandy. <START> Yeah. <START> He's got fugazidiamonds in both ears and leprechaun buckles on his shoes. <START> Running a fuckin' DippityDoo convention upstairs for a salad. <START> Driving a '94 Jeep YJ with a wave decal on the side. <START> Enough cologne to offend a Bangkok lady boy. <START> Good enough. <START> Do you want to hear the best part? <START> You really wanna hear the best part. <START> Okay. <START> He went full Bieber eyes. <START> What? <START> Bieber eyes. <START> Wayne. <START> Wayne. <START> Wayne, look. <START> It's inappropriate, McMurray. <START> Wayne, just look for fuck's sake. <START> Just fuckin' look, Wayne. <START> Full Bieber eyes. <START> What's that? <START> Bieber. <START> The pop star. <START> I'm not familiar with his work. <START> This must be where the dicks hang out, eh? <START> Our dicks hang out. <START> Yours is like a mushroom in a corn field. <START> Mind your fuckin' business, <START> Alexander. <START> Seen <START> Angie with her new dude? <START> What a fuckin' dandy. <START> Eyes on your own work there, super chief. <START> Thank Christ, Wayne, I'm pushing clobs here. <START> Get outta the way, I'm growing a tail. <START> Wayne, I would like to cordially invite you to the Burning Bush Youth Group this Sunday, for an evening of song and praise. <START> Hard no. <START> My sweetie, Margaret, is a first class gal. <START> She's got some friends she can introduce you to. <START> Margaret? <START> Sounds like a biddy old bluehair'd. <START> She's not. <START> She's a very focused young woman on the path to eternity with Christ. <START> And which part of that appeals to you? <START> I like singing the songs. <START> Sort yourself out. <START> You're a pervert, Daryl. <START> Jesus, your breath could stop a Mack truck right now. <START> All right, cool it. <START> What say, we go for a quick ice run, Wayne? <START> I'm pushing up on you for years now. <START> What's say you give old Gailor one for the scrapbook? <START> Huh? <START> I'll do the Youth Group. <START> All right. <START> Gail, looks like the John's allergic to fudge. <START> Bring the plunger, we may have to break this one up. <START> Told you to flush as you go. <START> Fuck. <START> Hi, Daryl. <START> Christ be with you. <START> Margaret. <START> And you must be Wayne. <START> Mmmhmm. <START> Christ be with you, Wayne. <START> Hello. <START> How are yous? <START> Oh, not s'bad. <START> Good 'n you? <START> Perfect. <START> You made a good choice coming here, tonight. <START> Yeah? <START> Why is that? <START> Hold your finger here for as long as you can. <START> What for. <START> All right. <START> Now imagine, your soul engulfed in that for all of eternity. <START> Okay. <START> God is good. <START> That's how they get you. <START> Wayne's been going through a bit of a rough break up, and I thought a night at the Burning Bush might help him out. <START> Plus, it's better than spending all his time on Tinder. <START> Tinder? <START> Did you know that it was originally called Grindr and that it was made for gay men to sodomize each other? <START> No. <START> Yeah. <START> Good way to get a finger in your bum. <START> Or a tongue in your bum. <START> Do you know what Dick Dingers are? <START> No. <START> It's when they snort drugs off of each other's erect penises. <START> That have just been in bums. <START> Oh, my gourd! <START> Look at this turnout. <START> Hi, everybody. <START> Quick question for all y'all. <START> How good is God? <START> I know, I know, I love him. <START> He's the best. <START> There's almost no one I like more. <START> Second question, has anyone seen. <START> Where is my beautiful girlfriend, Virginia? <START> Ginny, where are you?. <START> There she is, Ginny, come on up here. <START> Come up, Ginny. <START> Oh, ugh, Ginny. <START> Ginny, Ginny, Ginny. <START> Hmm. <START> I still remember, like it was yesterday, the day that the Lord gave you to me. <START> And he said, "Glen, "this is your blank canvas, it is pale. "It is colorless, it is almost cardboardlike. "I want you "to give it life, to give it color." <START> And so I said to the Lord, "I will give it everything, everything. "Except for one thing." What was that question? <START> Uh, hmm? <START> Vaginal intercourse! <START> Guess what, boys and girls? <START> You're in for somethin' special, 'cause we got The Salty Treats. <START> What the actual fuck is this place? <START> Why can't you just enjoy yourself? <START> It's 'cause I get onto this Tinder thing, and now they tell me it's for finding dudes. <START> But that's some bullshit, right? <START> I don't know. <START> You want some strawberry lemonade? <START> I haven't seen this sort of fuckin' bedlam since we fired Roman Candles at coyotes that night and caught one right in the butt hole, fuck. <START> Ran up the back porch, dropped seven shades of shit in Dad's work boots. <START> Could have been a wolf. <START> There's wolf's in the back bush. <START> There's for sure mooses. <START> Have a dart. <START> Yeah, I'd have a dart. <START> Oh, fuckin' Grindr. <START> Grindr?. <START> Grindr. <START> What? <START> Pray tell, what are you doing on Grindr, Wayne? <START> What are you skids doing out of your parents' basement, Stewart? <START> The gang and I have been doing hiphop karaoke for the better part of 48 hours. <START> Out on the decks. <START> Ones and twos. <START> The entire 48. <START> Subsequently spittin' hot fire. <START> Playing MegaMan and Final Fantasy on original NES. <START> Pokémon Gold, on GameBoy Color. <START> Gotta catch 'em all. <START> Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Charmeleon, Charizard, fuckin' Charmander. <START> Fuckin' Charmander. <START> Time to take about 20% off on the meth intake, boys. <START> Ever played Dr. <START> Mario on Super NES?. <START> Game is full of subliminal messages. <START> Hunter S. <START> Thompson would have had a field day. <START> Hunter S.? <START> Charles Bukowski. <START> Oh, yes, Chuck Bukowski. <START> That's a better one, Stewart. <START> Ever played <START> Aladdin on original Sega G? <START> Coffee? <START> Tea? <START> Sega? <START> Lion King was far ahead of its time. <START> Makes you think far beyond your years. <START> Disney games prevail! <START> You got any weed? <START> I always regret coming to the surface with you, daywalking hicks. <START> The minutiae of your world. <START> My basement resembles an island Xanadu, in comparison. <START> Okay. <START> Ah, but some quick math tells me this time, however, you've been so agonized by a woman you're now seeking the company of men. <START> Oh, okay. <START> We've all thought about it. <START> Well, good on you for doubling down. <START> Although, I didn't peg you for a pipe fitter, Wayne. <START> Pegged! <START> Five years with <START> Angie, we figured you were a concrete clam slammer. <START> Why drink from the furry cup when the garden hose is right there?

<START> I think Modeans is open. <START> Boy, howdy. <START> Well, well, well. <START> Daryl, girl, Wayne. <START> Bit surprised to see you here, I'm being honest. <START> Didn't realize you were big fan of the didge. <START> Aw. <START> More of a didgeredon't?
