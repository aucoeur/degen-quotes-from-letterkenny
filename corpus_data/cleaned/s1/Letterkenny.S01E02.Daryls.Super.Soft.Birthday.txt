'Cause he's a fuckin' basic. <START> And now he thinks he's the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <START> After that, we got Rat Ass. <START> Why's he called Rat Ass? 'Cause he's got a hairy ass like a rat. <START> Can confirm. <START> He beat up a guy named Brains. <START> See, his name's Brian but he spelt it Brain in the computer at bowling one time. <START> It just kinda stuck. <START> Now he thinks he's the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <START> And after that, we got Joint Boy. <START> Because he smokes lots of joints, Dairy. <START> Well, just plucking the low hanging fruit is what that is. <START> I've seen that guy take on four bouncers at the rippers one time. <START> He is otherworldly. <START> Got a dome on him like an Easter Island statue. <START> Is he single? <START> Not that it matters, I guess. <START> Look, keep it at the end of the lane way. <START> No degens on the property. <START> That's a Texas size 104. <START> Over and out. <START> Well, this is annoying. <START> The fuck are they doin' out there? <START> They're scared of you. <START> This snipe is a fuckin' sniper. <START> Snipe's a fuckin' beauty. <START> Fuckin' look at this snipe. <START> Fuckin' love this snipe. <START> We're snipe selling, boys. <START> Dirty fucking dangles, boys. <START> You're a sniper. <START> You're a snipe. <START> You're a skirt, you pansy. <START> If you make me walk up the lane way again, we're having babies. <START> Put it out! <START> Put it out! <START> Put it out! <START> Fuck! <START> Fuck! <START> Those boys need to give their balls a tug. <START> Maybe, check, make sure they're still attached right quick. <START> I'd rather put a mirror down there and see what's what. <START> One time, my cousin. <START> He tore open his ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick and he had to show it to his mum. <START> Was it his scrotal sack? <START> Well, you know. <START> That dangly piece of flesh, what hangs down behind the penis. <START> Scrotal sack. <START> The nut sack. <START> So, he tore his ball sack open trying to do a skateboard trick and he's gots to show it to his mum because apparently one of his testicles was showing. <START> Was it the right one or the left one? <START> Why is that of importance? <START> Well, because the left one has more sperm in it. <START> Spermatozoa is what it's called. <START> Tell you what, if I ripped open my ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick, I'd be more worried about seeing my vas deferens. <START> Well, you'd have to tear your ball sack pretty near wide open doing a skateboard trick if you wanted to see your own vas deferens. <START> I'm not sure I wanna see my own vas deferens I think if I saw my own vas deferens, I'd be quite worried. <START> I'd be most worried if I tore my ball sack open trying to do a skateboard trick if I could see my accessory glands. <START> Well, you don't want to go too kooky with accessories on your truck. <START> Or your jeep. <START> It's okay with like, a quad, though, like my buddy Big T's got a snorkel kit on his and that's pretty punk rock. <START> What's an accessory gland? <START> Well, if your vas deferens is your sperm ducts, the accessory glands is what supplies lubricant to the sperm duct. <START> I think if I ripped open my ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick, I'd be most worried about seeing my seminal vesicles. <START> Oh, like the Florida State seminal vesicles? <START> Like the sack that hangs behind your vas deferens and contains fructose which is energy for the sperm. <START> Yeah, it's like when you go in the city there and they got them charge stations for the people that drive the electric cars. <START> That's pretty much your seminal vesticles. <START> I thought it was pretty funny when I said Florida State seminal vesicles and nobody laughed. <START> Hello. <START> Okay. <START> End of the lane way. <START> Don't come up the property. <START> Good. <START> Sled Ted's here. <START> Geez, Basic Jay must have been a shit fighter to lose to that asshat. <START> I've known Basic Jay to be a pretty tough dude. <START> He's not really a fuckin' basic. <START> Guess he could have had a cold. <START> Or the flu. <START> Sled Ted had Bigfoot hands. <START> Yeah, he's a big grimy brute. <START> Shit fighter, though. <START> Do you guys remember the fragrance Brut? <START> Or Actif Brut? <START> Yeah. <START> Yeah, they still make that. <START> I always enjoyed that fragrance. <START> You can use it to dry up zits too. <START> Did you know you can use shaving cream to get permanent marker off your hands? <START> Why wouldn't you just dip your hands in the parts cleaner? <START> Well, most people don't have a parts cleaner. <START> Well, most likely Rat Ass will be your next dude. <START> I hear that he is a greaser. <START> Can confirm. <START> So fuckin' greasy I almost don't want to. <START> I saw him with his shirt off, swimming at the gravel pit not that long ago. <START> His back acne was extraordinary. <START> Well, like, extraordinary how? <START> Well, like, I thought about it for a while after is all. <START> Well, elaborate, 'cause I'm likely gonna have to touch it. <START> Well, like how it was cultivated. <START> Well, by not showering likely. <START> Likely. <START> Did you know that men can wear the fragrance CK ONE as well as women? <START> Yeah. <START> Yeah. <START> That's 'cause it's an unisex fragrance. <START> It says that right on the bottle. <START> But would ya? <START> Oh, negative. <START> Me neither. <START> Would you wear Gap Dream?. <START> No! <START> No, no, Dairy, that's for girls. <START> Dairy, that's for girls. <START> You can't walk around smelling like pretty girls. <START> You're not wearing it right now, are you? <START> Cologne is too expensive. <START> I just use sunscreen. <START> Banana Boat. <START> Let's get into some of those fuckin' all dressed chips. <START> Jesus, Katy, put some fuckin' clothes on. <START> Not my forte. <START> Unfortunate. <START> Hey, neighbor said he's not gonna give us a horse this year. <START> What? <START> Well, he said that last year we returned him and his breath smelled like alcohol. <START> Well, it was probably mine. <START> You could have lit my breath on fire the next day. <START> Horse was half cut though. <START> He said that he's gonna give us a donkey. <START> Nope. <START> Might be funny. <START> Gotta be a horse. <START> You don't fuck with tradition. <START> You're really gonna pump the brakes on a donkey dressed up like a unicorn? <START> Oh, I'm stompin' the brakes. <START> You put that idea right through the fuckin' windshield. <START> But it's a donkey dressed up like a unicorn. <START> Katy! <START> Well, it's better than a kick in the pants. <START> Do you want this to be the softest birthday party ever or not? <START> I want this just as much as you do. <START> Well, then find us a horse. <START> Please and thank you. <START> And don't stay out in the sun too long. <START> Your skin will look like an old saddle bag. <START> Yeah. <START> Hello. <START> Okay. <START> End of the lane way. <START> Don't come up the property. <START> Good. <START> Rat Ass is here. <START> Keep it standing. <START> This goes to the ground, we stand up. <START> Okay. <START> This goes to a clinch, we separate. <START> Great. <START> Let's go! <START> All right. <START> So, hit me. <START> Fight him or shut the fuck up. <START> I'll give you a free one. <START> What the fuck is this? <START> Let's fuckin' do this. <START> Just fuckin' square off. <START> Hey! <START> He's pulling hair, he's pulling hair. <START> Break 'em up, break 'em up. <START> Come on, come on!. <START> I'm gonna clock this shitty wolverine. <START> Hit me. <START> Come on. <START> I love pain. <START> Look at the execution, boys. <START> Look at the hustle, boys. <START> Ding. <START> You guys made the liquor run, right? <START> I was Donny Drives the car. <START> I was Nicki Navigates. <START> But, uh. <START> We couldn't find a lot of the stuff on the list. <START> Yeah. <START> Like what? <START> Uh, well. <START> Uh, there's ingredients that I don't think you can get in Letterkenny. <START> Yeah. <START> So, go to the city. <START> Yeah, but we got practice in a couple of hours. <START> We're gonna crush a couple sandos before, too. <START> Grab some nappies, maybe? <START> We haven't had our pregame naps either. <START> Nappies are nappies. <START> Ferda. <START> Ferda. <START> Well, we need everything on the list. <START> So, what drinks do you need ingredients for? <START> Uh, Corebelo Love Potion. <START> Uh, Purple Passion Punch. <START> Lemon Gingerini. <START> Apricot Toblerone Cocktail. <START> Couldn't find a Flirtini. <START> Couldn't find Sparkling Mango Sorbet Float. <START> Don't. <START> Don't know really what that is. <START> Well, that's all of them. <START> Ye. <START> Yeah. <START> Yeah. <START> Yeah. <START> Look, I have about a million things to do if this is gonna be the softest birthday party ever. <START> If you guys don't get me everything on the list, you'll be pulling each other's horns from now on. <START> Pitter patter! <START> So far! <START> Fuck, was he a beaker. <START> Like, he would not stop beaking. <START> That shit is the worst. <START> That was right to stick to the task at hand, pal. <START> Keep your trap shut. <START> Throw bombs. <START> I wouldn't say shit if my mouth was full of it. <START> I haven't seen that many hits since Good Charlotte played Warped Tour. <START> Yeah, more like. <START> Not very Good Charlotte. <START> I always liked NOFX. <START> YESFX. <START> Big fuckin' day, Dairy. <START> Big fuckin' day! <START> Big fuckin' day! <START> Ow. <START> Happy birthday, it's your special day Dairy. <START> Birthday beats! <START> Birthday beats! <START> Ow. <START> Oh, that's not polite, Katy. <START> You really are a Sally. <START> That's the most action I've seen since I gave the dairy cows' teats a good scrubbin'. <START> I don't need to know that. <START> You're pretty good at wrestling there, Katy, and that's what I appreciates about you. <START> Is that what you appreciate about me? <START> Let's go easy over there, squirrelly Dan. <START> Yeah. <START> Oh, hey, look at you, ground. <START> So, tell me about this guy, Joint Boy. <START> Well, I'm not gonna sugar coats it for you, Wayne. <START> This guy looks like an Australian rugbies player, chiseled out of stones. <START> Uhoh. <START> Got legs on him like tree trunks. <START> Is that a deciduous tree or a coniferous tree? <START> What? <START> Well, there's a difference. <START> If we're talking about, like, a maple tree, which is thick and deciduous or a Christmas tree, which is thin and coniferous. <START> Yeah, but both is hards and mades of woods, right? <START> There's a difference is all I'm saying. <START> What type of tree is a coconut tree? <START> It's a palm tree. <START> How do you know? <START> Well, like the Internet. <START> Oh. <START> Anyways, backs to Joint Boy. <START> How come I've never heard of him before? <START> Oh, he just gots out of jail. <START> He was arrested for assaults after he beats the shits out of a guy for pushin' up on his sister. <START> Got this big entourage of guys, baldheaded, bearded dudes what looks like a whole bunch of surly uncles. <START> You think we should call The Ginger? <START> Mmm. <START> No. <START> Why not? <START> He's tougher than hell. <START> Yeah, but. <START> Well, like you heard he fucked an ostrich, right? <START> He what? <START> He fucked an ostrich. <START> Allegedly. <START> How does a fella get caught up in that sort of business? <START> Well, I guess his cousin had an ostrich farm when he thought it might be fun to fuck one. <START> Allegedly. <START> So, he got hard somehow and he fucked an ostrich. <START> That's fucked. <START> That's a felony. <START> So, we use him in emergencies only, then. <START> I should say. <START> Dairy. <START> Hey, Dairy. <START> This one's for you. <START> Oh. <START> Hey, Joint Boy's here. <START> Which one of youse is Wayne?

<START> You left the dude pretty banged up. <START> I heard he kicked a slow learning fella in the bum while he was havin' a piss. <START> Now, that slow learning fella is my second cousin. <START> Okay. <START> Being the toughest guy in Letterkenny is important to me. <START> I'm sure it is to you too but we're all hicks here. <START> And you've done me a favor, so I'd be willing to shake your hand and call it a day. <START> I didn't do you no favors. 'Cause I don't know who the fuck you are. <START> We done talking? <START> You wanna come to a super soft birthday party? <START> Happy birthday, Dairy. <START> It's really more for them, ain't it? <START> What is?. <START> All this. <START> No, it's not. <START> It's cream cheese. <START> No. <START> That's cream cheese. <START> No. <START> Yeah, that's cream cheese. <START> Just go. <START> Jesus! <START> You remember they weren't allowed to have birthday parties growing up. <START> They had to go bucky at mine. <START> All they do is go alls out, don'ts they?. <START> That's a Texas size 104. <START> You know, if Joint Boy and his pals hadn't showed up, I figure this would have been the softest birthday ever. <START> That's a small victory for you, I suppose. <START> I was worried. <START> Thought I might have to get Stewart and the Skids to come over here and start hoovering up that white powder of theirs. <START> Anything for a little bit of an edge, am I right?. <START> The white stuff. <START> The snooter. <START> The devil's dandruff. <START> The dander. <START> I. <START> I hoovered up a bit of the schneef in my day. <START> You ever hoovered barnyard schneef? <START> I've hoovered behind the manure pile schneef. <START> You ever hoovered schneef off a sleeping cow's spine? <START> I've hoovered schneef off of an awake cow's teat. <START> What are the odds that I ride him home bareback? <START> Gonna hurt your balls, bro. <START> Good going. <START> Oh, yeah. <START> You ever hoovered library schneef? <START> I've hoovered schneef off of the cover of Gordon Korman's This Can't Be Happening at Macdonald Hall. <START> You wanna come home with me? <START> You can sleep in my bed. <START> He'd break it. <START> He'd break your bed. <START> His dick alone would break your bed. <START> I saw that too. <START> I. <START> Yeah. <START> It was really big. <START> You ever hoovered Sunday school schneef? <START> I've hoovered schneef off the collection plate in the rectory. <START> Do you know what dick dingers are? <START> Yep. <START> You know that movie with the guy who whispers to horses. <START> Brokeback Mountain? <START> No. <START> No. <START> That's the toughest guy in Letterkenny.
