'Cause he's a fuckin' basic. <STOP> <START> And now he thinks he's the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> After that, we got Rat Ass. <STOP> <START> Why's he called Rat Ass? 'Cause he's got a hairy ass like a rat. <STOP> <START> Can confirm. <STOP> <START> He beat up a guy named Brains. <STOP> <START> See, his name's Brian but he spelt it Brain in the computer at bowling one time. <STOP> <START> It just kinda stuck. <STOP> <START> Now he thinks he's the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> And after that, we got Joint Boy. <STOP> <START> Because he smokes lots of joints, Dairy. <STOP> <START> Well, just plucking the low hanging fruit is what that is. <STOP> <START> I've seen that guy take on four bouncers at the rippers one time. <STOP> <START> He is otherworldly. <STOP> <START> Got a dome on him like an Easter Island statue. <STOP> <START> Is he single? <STOP> <START> Not that it matters, I guess. <STOP> <START> Look, keep it at the end of the lane way. <STOP> <START> No degens on the property. <STOP> <START> That's a Texas size 104. <STOP> <START> Over and out. <STOP> <START> Well, this is annoying. <STOP> <START> The fuck are they doin' out there?

<STOP> <START> Well, you know. <STOP> <START> That dangly piece of flesh, what hangs down behind the penis. <STOP> <START> Scrotal sack. <STOP> <START> The nut sack. <STOP> <START> So, he tore his ball sack open trying to do a skateboard trick and he's gots to show it to his mum because apparently one of his testicles was showing. <STOP> <START> Was it the right one or the left one? <STOP> <START> Why is that of importance? <STOP> <START> Well, because the left one has more sperm in it. <STOP> <START> Spermatozoa is what it's called. <STOP> <START> Tell you what, if I ripped open my ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick, I'd be more worried about seeing my vas deferens. <STOP> <START> Well, you'd have to tear your ball sack pretty near wide open doing a skateboard trick if you wanted to see your own vas deferens. <STOP> <START> I'm not sure I wanna see my own vas deferens I think if I saw my own vas deferens, I'd be quite worried. <STOP> <START> I'd be most worried if I tore my ball sack open trying to do a skateboard trick if I could see my accessory glands. <STOP> <START> Well, you don't want to go too kooky with accessories on your truck. <STOP> <START> Or your jeep. <STOP> <START> It's okay with like, a quad, though, like my buddy Big T's got a snorkel kit on his and that's pretty punk rock. <STOP> <START> What's an accessory gland? <STOP> <START> Well, if your vas deferens is your sperm ducts, the accessory glands is what supplies lubricant to the sperm duct. <STOP> <START> I think if I ripped open my ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick, I'd be most worried about seeing my seminal vesicles. <STOP> <START> Oh, like the Florida State seminal vesicles? <STOP> <START> Like the sack that hangs behind your vas deferens and contains fructose which is energy for the sperm. <START> Yeah, it's like when you go in the city there and they got them charge stations for the people that drive the electric cars. <STOP> <START> That's pretty much your seminal vesticles. <STOP> <START> I thought it was pretty funny when I said Florida State seminal vesicles and nobody laughed. <STOP> <START> Hello. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> End of the lane way. <STOP> <START> Don't come up the property. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> Sled Ted's here. <STOP> <START> Geez, Basic Jay must have been a shit fighter to lose to that asshat. <STOP> <START> I've known Basic Jay to be a pretty tough dude. <STOP> <START> He's not really a fuckin' basic. <STOP> <START> Guess he could have had a cold. <STOP> <START> Or the flu. <STOP> <START> Sled Ted had Bigfoot hands. <START> Yeah, he's a big grimy brute. <STOP> <START> Shit fighter, though. <STOP> <START> Do you guys remember the fragrance Brut? <STOP> <START> Or Actif Brut? <START> Yeah. <START> Yeah, they still make that. <STOP> <START> I always enjoyed that fragrance. <START> You can use it to dry up zits too. <STOP> <START> Did you know you can use shaving cream to get permanent marker off your hands? <STOP> <START> Why wouldn't you just dip your hands in the parts cleaner? <STOP> <START> Well, most people don't have a parts cleaner. <STOP> <START> Well, most likely Rat Ass will be your next dude. <STOP> <START> I hear that he is a greaser. <STOP> <START> Can confirm. <STOP> <START> So fuckin' greasy I almost don't want to. <STOP> <START> I saw him with his shirt off, swimming at the gravel pit not that long ago. <STOP> <START> His back acne was extraordinary. <STOP> <START> Well, like, extraordinary how? <STOP> <START> Well, like, I thought about it for a while after is all. <STOP> <START> Well, elaborate, 'cause I'm likely gonna have to touch it. <STOP> <START> Well, like how it was cultivated. <STOP> <START> Well, by not showering likely. <STOP> <START> Likely. <STOP> <START> Did you know that men can wear the fragrance CK ONE as well as women? <START> Yeah. <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> That's 'cause it's an unisex fragrance. <STOP> <START> It says that right on the bottle. <STOP> <START> But would ya? <STOP> <START> Oh, negative. <STOP> <START> Me neither. <STOP> <START> Would you wear Gap Dream?. <STOP> <START> No! <STOP> <START> No, no, Dairy, that's for girls. <STOP> <START> Dairy, that's for girls. <START> You can't walk around smelling like pretty girls. <START> You're not wearing it right now, are you? <STOP> <START> Cologne is too expensive. <STOP> <START> I just use sunscreen. <STOP> <START> Banana Boat. <STOP> <START> Let's get into some of those fuckin' all dressed chips. <STOP> <START> Jesus, Katy, put some fuckin' clothes on. <STOP> <START> Not my forte. <STOP> <START> Unfortunate. <STOP> <START> Hey, neighbor said he's not gonna give us a horse this year. <STOP> <START> What? <STOP> <START> Well, he said that last year we returned him and his breath smelled like alcohol. <STOP> <START> Well, it was probably mine. <START> You could have lit my breath on fire the next day. <STOP> <START> Horse was half cut though. <STOP> <START> He said that he's gonna give us a donkey. <STOP> <START> Nope. <STOP> <START> Might be funny. <STOP> <START> Gotta be a horse. <START> You don't fuck with tradition. <START> You're really gonna pump the brakes on a donkey dressed up like a unicorn? <STOP> <START> Oh, I'm stompin' the brakes. <START> You put that idea right through the fuckin' windshield. <STOP> <START> But it's a donkey dressed up like a unicorn. <STOP> <START> Katy! <STOP> <START> Well, it's better than a kick in the pants. <STOP> <START> Do you want this to be the softest birthday party ever or not? <STOP> <START> I want this just as much as you do. <STOP> <START> Well, then find us a horse. <STOP> <START> Please and thank you. <STOP> <START> And don't stay out in the sun too long. <START> Your skin will look like an old saddle bag. <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Hello. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> End of the lane way. <STOP> <START> Don't come up the property. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> Rat Ass is here. <STOP> <START> Keep it standing. <STOP> <START> This goes to the ground, we stand up. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> This goes to a clinch, we separate. <STOP> <START> Great. <STOP> <START> Let's go! <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> So, hit me. <STOP> <START> Fight him or shut the fuck up. <STOP> <START> I'll give you a free one. <STOP> <START> What the fuck is this?
