(HIPHOP MUSIC PLAYIN<START> G). <START> Katy! <START> What is this fucking gong show? <START> We're supposed to be napping right now, boys. <START> What? <START> We are at home. <START> In the middle of a 'Chel tournament with big dingers in. <START> When we see you've been liking all this duster's farts on Fartbook. <START> And none of this beauty's farts. <START> And not one of this grain fed, USDA certified, 100% nonanimal tested, organic beauty. <START> Not one. <START> You're welcome. <START> Thanks, buddy. <START> So? <START> So he's gonna think you wanna fucking wheel him. <START> He's gonna think that you wanna turn on the jets. <START> Because I like his farts? <START> Yes. <START> I'm just pushing a button. <START> It doesn't mean anything. <START> What the fuck are you looking at, you fuckin' pilon? <START> Fucking vampire. <START> Pipe down, idiots. <START> Get in the house. <START> Now. <START> I'm gonna get you, you fuckin' pheasant! <START> We're comin' phezzy! <START> Guys. <START> Boy, you're havin' quite a day, Superchief. <START> We've got another problem. <START> Where's <START> Glen? <START> Daryl, Rage Monkeys. <START> Daniel. <START> Wayne. <START> We've summoned you here today to talk to you about your Fartbook profile. <START> Allonsy. <START> You have no photos and no farts but are friends with everyone along for the test drive. <START> Hmm. <START> I'm not friends with everyone. <START> I'm not friends with Wayne yet. <START> But I wanna be. <START> It seems as though you were just cruising through Fartbook liking and commenting on everyone's farts but contributing nothing yourself. <START> Nothing. <START> I am as <START> God made me. <START> Blessed with a very healthy gastrointestinal system. <START> Not super farty. <START> What you're doing is called creeping. <START> Not what Fartbook is all about. <START> I genuinely enjoy farts. <START> You can't just go around creeping other people's farts. <START> What the truck is wrong with that? <START> If you continue to misuse Fartbook, we'll have to suspend your membership. <START> Fine. <START> Fine. <START> Fluff you then. <START> I have millions. <START> And I mean, millions of ways of hearing unlimited farts. <START> We're done here, <START> Glen. <START> Are we though? <START> Are we? <START> I think we should pump the brakes on Fartbook. <START> That's a Texassize 104. <START> Why? <START> It's kicking up too much dust. <START> We haven't even gotten into it and already folks are gettin' chapped asses. <START> Well, that's their problem. <START> Not ours. <START> This is our problem. <START> We started Fartbook so that good folks could share farts with other good folks. <START> That's it. <START> Not to creepin' farts, or spam farts. <START> Although, if you eat spam, you'll get good farts. <START> Farts should never come between the love of a man and a woman. <START> It's not right. <START> You don't get to 500 million farts without making a few sharts. <START> Exactly. <START> So, what are you saying? <START> Fartbook dies today. <START> Today, Fartbook is dead. <START> Oh. <START> You think so? <START> I'm with the fellas on this one. <START> It's not why we invented it. <START> You invented it? <START> Our idea. <START> We built the site. <START> You know, you really don't need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this. <START> If you were the inventors of Fartbook, you'd have invented Fartbook. <START> Hold your horses there. <START> Let's put this to a vote. <START> Those for closing down Fartbook, raise your hands. <START> Those against? <START> But we own 30 percent. <START> This isn't fair! <START> If you want to sit on our backs and call yourselves tall, you have every right to do so. <START> But don't think that we're gonna sit here and enjoy listening to you lie. <START> You have a bit of our attention, you have the smallest bit of our attention. <START> When did we ask for your attention? <START> The rest of our attention is back at the offices of Fartbook, where my friends and I are doing things that no one on this farm, especially and including you idiots, are intellectually, creatively, artistically, emotionally, or spiritually capable of doing. <START> Have I adequately answered your condescending question? <START> What question?. <START> Farts! <START> You better lawyer up, asshole, because I'm not coming back for 30 percent, I'm coming back for everything. <START> I. <START> I don't know what happened just now. <START> No. <START> No. <START> You know, I've been thinking about Fartbook. <START> What about it, bigshits?. <START> I think maybe we pulled the cord too quick on that, you parachute. <START> I miss it too, threepoint shoes. <START> I was on there a lot. <START> Too much, likely. <START> I was always checking it. <START> It was very addicting. <START> Except, did you ever really stop to think about one thing, did you? <START> Rippin' farts into your computer doesn't exactly spike the likelihood of having sex with girls. <START> Hey! <START> Hey! <START> Hey! <START> Not now. <START> Need 20 minutes. <START> Okay. <START> Just wanted to let you know that <START> Glen stole our website. <START> It's been live for more than 36 hours. <START> Hey! <START> Hey! <START> Fuck it!.  Oh! <START> Fuck's sake. <START> Jesus! <START> Fucking sort yourselves out. <START> Cheese and rice. <START> I can't remember the last time five men came in this church so aggressively. <START> Or can I? <START> You stole our idea. <START> Hmm. <START> Are you referring to Christian Fart Mingle? <START> What's that? <START> It's like Christian Mingle, but for farts. <START> We asked your help with our idea and you went behind our backs and stole'd it. <START> I didn't. <START> Excuse. <START> Oh, my <START> God. <START> Those are some hairy allegations you are firing, at my face. <START> All your allegations. <START> All of them, completely fricken' false. <START> Baseless. <START> How? <START> Stewart, I did not steal anything. <START> Because the last time I checked, taking advantage of a growing trend was not stealing. <START> What trend? <START> I'll tell you. <START> But first, let's sing a hymn. <START> No. <START> No. <START> Fine. <START> Look, y'all had a good idea, all right? <START> You had a terrific idea. <START> Congratulations. <START> But did you actually think you were the only ones in the world to have it? <START> What are you talking about? <START> I'm talking about Fart culture, Stewart. <START> It's all the rage. <START> It's everywhere. <START> You know. <START> Nothing. <START> Glen will show you. <START> Ever heard of Plenty of Farts? <START> I've heard of Plenty of Fish. <START> It's very much like that, except for farts. <START> Here. <START> Here's the one I like the best. <START> It's called Fart Filter. <START> And I like it because you can put different filters on all of your farts and it's fun. <START> So, yeah, I'll just show you how it works. <START> This one, no filter. <START> Nothing. <START> Who cares? <START> Not <START> Glen, right? <START> Vanilla. <START> Pedestrian. <START> I'm not interested. <START> However, shove that baby through the Hudson filter. <START> What's she gonna sound like? <START> Now there's a renovation. <START> Now suck on your Sutro filter. <START> Now boys, because I'm feeling generous, and we're in the Lord's house, I'm gonna play you the filter that I invented myself. <START> I call it. <START> Valencia. <START> Wow. <START> There is a whole site devoted to glutenfree farts. <START> The point is, it's out there, boys. <START> It's happened. <START> The idea lives in the world. <START> Y'all are too slow. <START> Slow on the uptake. <START> Sad story. <START> Boohoo. <START> Toottoot! <START> Go away. <START> Let's go. <START> Sad face, sad face, angry face. <START> Better slow down there, Bigshoots. <START> Tomorrow's gonna be a great day for hay. <START> If you can be a man at night, you can be a man in the morning. <START> Wayne, how come you didn't join Fartbook? 'Cause you're not supposed to fart in front of girls. <START> What? <START> There's certain things that should stay sacred between a man and a woman. <START> So, all things considered, this whole thing's pretty fucking juvenile, if I do say so myself. <START> If she's always listening to your ass acoustics, or even worse, smellin' 'em, I guarantee she'll be slower and slower to crawl into bed with you at night. <START> What you just said is outrageous. <START> No it isn't. <START> It's true. <START> I don't wanna be smelling a dude's ass all the time. <START> Get real. <START> What are you? <START> Some kind of fart purist? <START> So what are you supposed to do? <START> Just hold it in? <START> Or take a shit, you fuckin' degenerate. <START> Speaking of shit, my second cousin's got IBS. <START> Who, <START> Garrett? <START> No, Jarett. <START> No. <START> IBS, the International Business Solution? <START> IBS stands for Irritable Bowel Syndromes. <START> Anyhoo, when he was a kid, Jackass comes out on the air, so it becomes real popular in his high school, for kids to start taking shits in places what weren't meant for taking shits in. <START> They calls that guerrilla shittin'. <START> Is this a true story? <START> So, he became real popular with his friends, with his ability to take a shits any time he needed to. <START> They'd call him up when they get an idea of a place that needed a shits taken in, and be like, "Hey, why don't you comes over here and takes a shits?" Anyhow, this one time his pal texts him up, and he says, "Hey, why don't you come take a shits in the girls' bathroom?" So, he drinks a coffee, eats a bran muffin, heads on down to the washroom there, but when he opens the bathroom door, what does he find? <START> But this pretty young girl just dropping a shits, right there in the middle of the bathroom floor. <START> And that's how he met his lovely Eunice. <START> And they fells in love, and they've been together ever since. <START> They raised three little shits. <START> So. <START> With all due respect, Miss Katy, there is a market for gentlemens what can find ladies who like, uh, farts, or shits, or even guerrilla shittin's. <START> That is not a true story. <START> That is a true story. <START> God help us all. <START> You know what, I don't know why you guys need everybody knowing your business anyway. <START> Like why you gotta put everything on the internet, while you're doing it, or after you're done doing it? <START> Well, if you don't puts it on the internet, how's gonna people know what you did? <START> Do you wanna know what? <START> That's your problem right there. <START> Should be playing your cards close to your chest. <START> Keep the ladies guessin' a little bit. <START> Be the mystery man. <START> Right again. <START> Oh, if a woman's not gonna love me for my farts or for me posting my bowling scores on the internet. <START> Not really sure I want one. <START> Well, then it's a good thing you's two have each other.
