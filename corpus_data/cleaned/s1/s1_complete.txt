<STOP> <START> Are we? <STOP> <START> I think we should pump the brakes on Fartbook. <STOP> <START> That's a Texassize 104. <STOP> <START> Why? <STOP> <START> It's kicking up too much dust. <STOP> <START> We haven't even gotten into it and already folks are gettin' chapped asses. <STOP> <START> Well, that's their problem. <STOP> <START> Not ours. <STOP> <START> This is our problem. <STOP> <START> We started Fartbook so that good folks could share farts with other good folks. <STOP> <START> That's it. <STOP> <START> Not to creepin' farts, or spam farts. <STOP> <START> Although, if you eat spam, you'll get good farts. <STOP> <START> Farts should never come between the love of a man and a woman. <STOP> <START> It's not right. <STOP> <START> You don't get to 500 million farts without making a few sharts. <STOP> <START> Exactly. <STOP> <START> So, what are you saying? <STOP> <START> Fartbook dies today. <STOP> <START> Today, Fartbook is dead. <STOP> <START> Oh. <STOP> <START> You think so? <STOP> <START> I'm with the fellas on this one. <STOP> <START> It's not why we invented it. <STOP> <START> You invented it? <STOP> <START> Our idea. <STOP> <START> We built the site. <STOP> <START> You know, you really don't need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this. <STOP> <START> If you were the inventors of Fartbook, you'd have invented Fartbook. <STOP> <START> Hold your horses there. <STOP> <START> Let's put this to a vote. <STOP> <START> Those for closing down Fartbook, raise your hands. <STOP> <START> Those against? <STOP> <START> But we own 30 percent. <STOP> <START> This isn't fair! <STOP> <START> If you want to sit on our backs and call yourselves tall, you have every right to do so. <STOP> <START> But don't think that we're gonna sit here and enjoy listening to you lie. <STOP> <START> You have a bit of our attention, you have the smallest bit of our attention. <STOP> <START> When did we ask for your attention? <STOP> <START> The rest of our attention is back at the offices of Fartbook, where my friends and I are doing things that no one on this farm, especially and including you idiots, are intellectually, creatively, artistically, emotionally, or spiritually capable of doing. <STOP> <START> Have I adequately answered your condescending question? <STOP> <START> What question?. <STOP> <START> Farts! <STOP> <START> You better lawyer up, asshole, because I'm not coming back for 30 percent, I'm coming back for everything. <STOP> <START> I. <STOP> <START> I don't know what happened just now. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> You know, I've been thinking about Fartbook. <STOP> <START> What about it, bigshits?. <STOP> <START> I think maybe we pulled the cord too quick on that, you parachute. <STOP> <START> I miss it too, threepoint shoes. <STOP> <START> I was on there a lot. <STOP> <START> Too much, likely. <STOP> <START> I was always checking it. <STOP> <START> It was very addicting. <STOP> <START> Except, did you ever really stop to think about one thing, did you? <STOP> <START> Rippin' farts into your computer doesn't exactly spike the likelihood of having sex with girls. <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Not now. <STOP> <START> Need 20 minutes. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Just wanted to let you know that <START> Glen stole our website. <STOP> <START> It's been live for more than 36 hours. <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Hey! <STOP> <START> Fuck it!.

<STOP> <START> No, he'll have one in his purse. <STOP> <START> Or maybe his clutch. <STOP> <START> Party's happening, Daryl. <START> You don't fuck with tradition. <STOP> <START> So. <STOP> <START> The agenda. <STOP> <START> After your dust up over the weekend, safe to assume you're fighting again? <STOP> <START> Corect. <STOP> <START> Tenfour, good buddy. <STOP> <START> Well, it's gonna be a busy week 'cause there's a few guys walking around town claiming to be the toughest guys in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> I'm the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <START> You were the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> It's been some time. <STOP> <START> Now, it's safe to assume that that title is as important to you now as it was then? <STOP> <START> Does a duck with a boner drag weeds? <STOP> <START> Tenfour, good buddy! <STOP> <START> Then it's safe to assume that the challengers will be coming up around the farm, as that is how you've conducted business in the past. <STOP> <START> Well, I was never one for an audience. <STOP> <START> All right, let's talk about the challengers. <STOP> <START> First up, we've got Sled Ted. <STOP> <START> Why's he called Sled Ted? <STOP> <START> Well, he likes fixin' sleds, and ridin' sleds, and talkin' about sleds. <STOP> <START> He just really likes sleddin', boys. <STOP> <START> Uh, he beat up a guy named Basic Jay. <STOP> <START> Why's he called Basic Jay? 'Cause he's a fuckin' basic. <STOP> <START> And now he thinks he's the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> After that, we got Rat Ass. <STOP> <START> Why's he called Rat Ass? 'Cause he's got a hairy ass like a rat. <STOP> <START> Can confirm. <STOP> <START> He beat up a guy named Brains. <STOP> <START> See, his name's Brian but he spelt it Brain in the computer at bowling one time. <STOP> <START> It just kinda stuck. <STOP> <START> Now he thinks he's the toughest guy in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> And after that, we got Joint Boy. <STOP> <START> Because he smokes lots of joints, Dairy. <STOP> <START> Well, just plucking the low hanging fruit is what that is. <STOP> <START> I've seen that guy take on four bouncers at the rippers one time. <STOP> <START> He is otherworldly. <STOP> <START> Got a dome on him like an Easter Island statue. <STOP> <START> Is he single? <STOP> <START> Not that it matters, I guess. <STOP> <START> Look, keep it at the end of the lane way. <STOP> <START> No degens on the property. <STOP> <START> That's a Texas size 104. <STOP> <START> Over and out. <STOP> <START> Well, this is annoying. <STOP> <START> The fuck are they doin' out there? <STOP> <START> They're scared of you. <STOP> <START> This snipe is a fuckin' sniper. <STOP> <START> Snipe's a fuckin' beauty. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' look at this snipe. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' love this snipe. <STOP> <START> We're snipe selling, boys. <STOP> <START> Dirty fucking dangles, boys. <START> You're a sniper. <START> You're a snipe. <START> You're a skirt, you pansy. <STOP> <START> If you make me walk up the lane way again, we're having babies. <STOP> <START> Put it out! <STOP> <START> Put it out! <STOP> <START> Put it out! <STOP> <START> Fuck! <STOP> <START> Fuck! <STOP> <START> Those boys need to give their balls a tug. <STOP> <START> Maybe, check, make sure they're still attached right quick. <STOP> <START> I'd rather put a mirror down there and see what's what. <STOP> <START> One time, my cousin. <STOP> <START> He tore open his ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick and he had to show it to his mum. <STOP> <START> Was it his scrotal sack? <STOP> <START> Well, you know. <STOP> <START> That dangly piece of flesh, what hangs down behind the penis. <STOP> <START> Scrotal sack. <STOP> <START> The nut sack. <STOP> <START> So, he tore his ball sack open trying to do a skateboard trick and he's gots to show it to his mum because apparently one of his testicles was showing. <STOP> <START> Was it the right one or the left one? <STOP> <START> Why is that of importance? <STOP> <START> Well, because the left one has more sperm in it. <STOP> <START> Spermatozoa is what it's called. <STOP> <START> Tell you what, if I ripped open my ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick, I'd be more worried about seeing my vas deferens. <STOP> <START> Well, you'd have to tear your ball sack pretty near wide open doing a skateboard trick if you wanted to see your own vas deferens. <STOP> <START> I'm not sure I wanna see my own vas deferens I think if I saw my own vas deferens, I'd be quite worried. <STOP> <START> I'd be most worried if I tore my ball sack open trying to do a skateboard trick if I could see my accessory glands. <STOP> <START> Well, you don't want to go too kooky with accessories on your truck. <STOP> <START> Or your jeep. <STOP> <START> It's okay with like, a quad, though, like my buddy Big T's got a snorkel kit on his and that's pretty punk rock. <STOP> <START> What's an accessory gland? <STOP> <START> Well, if your vas deferens is your sperm ducts, the accessory glands is what supplies lubricant to the sperm duct. <STOP> <START> I think if I ripped open my ball sack trying to do a skateboard trick, I'd be most worried about seeing my seminal vesicles. <STOP> <START> Oh, like the Florida State seminal vesicles? <STOP> <START> Like the sack that hangs behind your vas deferens and contains fructose which is energy for the sperm. <START> Yeah, it's like when you go in the city there and they got them charge stations for the people that drive the electric cars. <STOP> <START> That's pretty much your seminal vesticles. <STOP> <START> I thought it was pretty funny when I said Florida State seminal vesicles and nobody laughed. <STOP> <START> Hello. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> End of the lane way. <STOP> <START> Don't come up the property. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> Sled Ted's here. <STOP> <START> Geez, Basic Jay must have been a shit fighter to lose to that asshat. <STOP> <START> I've known Basic Jay to be a pretty tough dude. <STOP> <START> He's not really a fuckin' basic. <STOP> <START> Guess he could have had a cold. <STOP> <START> Or the flu. <STOP> <START> Sled Ted had Bigfoot hands. <START> Yeah, he's a big grimy brute. <STOP> <START> Shit fighter, though. <STOP> <START> Do you guys remember the fragrance Brut? <STOP> <START> Or Actif Brut? <START> Yeah. <START> Yeah, they still make that. <STOP> <START> I always enjoyed that fragrance. <START> You can use it to dry up zits too. <STOP> <START> Did you know you can use shaving cream to get permanent marker off your hands? <STOP> <START> Why wouldn't you just dip your hands in the parts cleaner? <STOP> <START> Well, most people don't have a parts cleaner. <STOP> <START> Well, most likely Rat Ass will be your next dude. <STOP> <START> I hear that he is a greaser. <STOP> <START> Can confirm. <STOP> <START> So fuckin' greasy I almost don't want to. <STOP> <START> I saw him with his shirt off, swimming at the gravel pit not that long ago. <STOP> <START> His back acne was extraordinary. <STOP> <START> Well, like, extraordinary how? <STOP> <START> Well, like, I thought about it for a while after is all. <STOP> <START> Well, elaborate, 'cause I'm likely gonna have to touch it. <STOP> <START> Well, like how it was cultivated. <STOP> <START> Well, by not showering likely. <STOP> <START> Likely. <STOP> <START> Did you know that men can wear the fragrance CK ONE as well as women? <START> Yeah. <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> That's 'cause it's an unisex fragrance. <STOP> <START> It says that right on the bottle. <STOP> <START> But would ya? <STOP> <START> Oh, negative. <STOP> <START> Me neither. <STOP> <START> Would you wear Gap Dream?. <STOP> <START> No! <STOP> <START> No, no, Dairy, that's for girls. <STOP> <START> Dairy, that's for girls. <START> You can't walk around smelling like pretty girls. <START> You're not wearing it right now, are you? <STOP> <START> Cologne is too expensive. <STOP> <START> I just use sunscreen. <STOP> <START> Banana Boat. <STOP> <START> Let's get into some of those fuckin' all dressed chips. <STOP> <START> Jesus, Katy, put some fuckin' clothes on. <STOP> <START> Not my forte. <STOP> <START> Unfortunate. <STOP> <START> Hey, neighbor said he's not gonna give us a horse this year. <STOP> <START> What? <STOP> <START> Well, he said that last year we returned him and his breath smelled like alcohol. <STOP> <START> Well, it was probably mine. <START> You could have lit my breath on fire the next day. <STOP> <START> Horse was half cut though. <STOP> <START> He said that he's gonna give us a donkey. <STOP> <START> Nope. <STOP> <START> Might be funny. <STOP> <START> Gotta be a horse. <START> You don't fuck with tradition. <START> You're really gonna pump the brakes on a donkey dressed up like a unicorn? <STOP> <START> Oh, I'm stompin' the brakes. <START> You put that idea right through the fuckin' windshield. <STOP> <START> But it's a donkey dressed up like a unicorn. <STOP> <START> Katy! <STOP> <START> Well, it's better than a kick in the pants. <STOP> <START> Do you want this to be the softest birthday party ever or not? <STOP> <START> I want this just as much as you do. <STOP> <START> Well, then find us a horse. <STOP> <START> Please and thank you. <STOP> <START> And don't stay out in the sun too long. <START> Your skin will look like an old saddle bag. <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Hello. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> End of the lane way. <STOP> <START> Don't come up the property. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> Rat Ass is here. <STOP> <START> Keep it standing. <STOP> <START> This goes to the ground, we stand up. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> This goes to a clinch, we separate. <STOP> <START> Great. <STOP> <START> Let's go! <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> So, hit me. <STOP> <START> Fight him or shut the fuck up. <STOP> <START> I'll give you a free one. <STOP> <START> What the fuck is this?

<STOP> <START> Oh, not so bad. <STOP> <START> Ooh, look what you brought with you. <STOP> <START> Hello, Daryl. <STOP> <START> Oh, fuck. <STOP> <START> Fuck, you're naked as a jay bird. <STOP> <START> Wayne, it's humid. <STOP> <START> It's the humidity. <STOP> <START> Y'all might want to think about doing the same thing, just pop your pants right off, that way no one gets sticky. <STOP> <START> Nope. <STOP> <START> It's not so bad. <STOP> <START> What's the fuss? <STOP> <START> Ma O'Dell mentioned something about you helping her get a squirrel out of her attic. <STOP> <START> I'm faced with a similar conundrum. <STOP> <START> Right over there. <STOP> <START> It seems some kinda rodent's made his home over there. <STOP> <START> I have not seen him, but I sure can smell him. <STOP> <START> Hum. <STOP> <START> It's a possum. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> Possum. <STOP> <START> That's right. <STOP> <START> Oh, pitter patter, let's get at 'er. <STOP> <START> Do you wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I'd reach into a pirate hooker's chamber pot before I'd reach in there. <START> And I'm going to tell ya. <STOP> <START> Possums are immune to snake venom. <STOP> <START> They could probably survive a nuclear blast. <STOP> <START> I think it's pronounced newcuelar. <STOP> <START> Mmm, but it isn't. <STOP> <START> They're mutants. <STOP> <START> They have forked fuckin' penises. <STOP> <START> We should all be so lucky. <STOP> <START> They do this thing called 'Playing Possum' where they appear dead and emit a death stink from their butt holes, fuck. <STOP> <START> I found one playing possum one time, thought it was dead and buried it. <STOP> <START> It dug itself out a few hours later and fucked a hen right in front of her chicks. <STOP> <START> Wayne, think about the swear jar. <STOP> <START> You're putting so much money in. <START> All right, let me take peek see? <STOP> <START> Pitterpatter. <START> Always had a skilled hand in wrangling vermin. <STOP> <START> Thank you, Daryl. <START> And that doesn't surprise me. <STOP> <START> No sweat. <STOP> <START> No sweat?

<STOP> <START> Glen? <STOP> <START> Yes. <STOP> <START> Let's take about 20% off 'er up there, all right? <STOP> <START> Now, you wanna have an eye because he'll come out meaner and spit and go like a hot damn. <STOP> <START> Is he likely to bite? <STOP> <START> Is a duck's ass watertight? <STOP> <START> Get ready to give him the size nine's if he jukes by me. <STOP> <START> How be I give him the size twelve and a halfs instead? <STOP> <START> Oh, I see him. <STOP> <START> That's some drunk evolution right there, bud. <STOP> <START> You gotta wonder what two Christmade miscreants mated to make that. <STOP> <START> It's almost not worth thinkin' about. <STOP> <START> Do I just reach for him? <STOP> <START> That's a better idea than going in head first. <STOP> <START> Put him where? <STOP> <START> Under my boot. <STOP> <START> Boys, just do your best not to make too big a mess, all right? <START> And I'm sorry again about all this heat. <STOP> <START> Whoohoo! <STOP> <START> Oh, for fucksakes. <STOP> <START> Ow. <STOP> <START> You wish there was a Pied Piper for possums, but there isn't, so you're gonna have to just keep pickin' 'em off with the .22. <STOP> <START> Buckle up 'cause they're fuckin' ugly. <STOP> <START> Of course, that's not to say I have it all my damn self. <STOP> <START> Is that a herpe on your hand, Daryl? <STOP> <START> Did you pay a little extra to go all the way with a ripper in the back room again?. <STOP> <START> No, I don't think he'd make that mistake twice. <STOP> <START> Got a little trouser trauma? <STOP> <START> Was she fun or was she fungal? <STOP> <START> Hey, guess what? <START> A guy's girlfriend is having a hard time parking the car, right? <STOP> <START> He says, You should get tested. <STOP> <START> She says, Well no, I'm not so bad at driving. <STOP> <START> He says, No, I have chlamydia. <STOP> <START> Is that a bite? <STOP> <START> The guy takes a hooker out for supper. <STOP> <START> He gave her his peas, she gave him herpes. <STOP> <START> Daryl, what happened? <STOP> <START> Did something bite you?. <START> A possum. <START> A possum?. <STOP> <START> That's right. <STOP> <START> Well, he could have rabies. <STOP> <START> Boo fuckin' hoo. <STOP> <START> No, rabies is serious. <STOP> <START> It attacks the central nervous system. <STOP> <START> If he gets puke between the floor boards it ain't coming out. <STOP> <START> Well, I can't take him to the clinic. <STOP> <START> I gotta do an ice run for the jamboree this week. <STOP> <START> Oh, Christ. <STOP> <START> Well, Daryl, we're gonna have to take your van. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah? <STOP> <START> Where's your nut sack boyfriend's today, Katy? <STOP> <START> They're at an away game against the Natives. <STOP> <START> Oh, I bet they're looking forward to playing those tough pricks. <STOP> <START> Christ. <STOP> <START> You sure you're ready to saddle up to the jamboree again? <STOP> <START> It was kind of you and <START> Angie's thing. <STOP> <START> No sense sittin' on my hands. <STOP> <START> Time to find a new dance partner. <START> All right, Daryl. <STOP> <START> Pitterpatter. <STOP> <START> Hey, why are crabs always so tired? <STOP> <START> It's 'cause they only sleep in snatches. <STOP> <START> Hey, wait a minute. <STOP> <START> We're. <STOP> <START> We're missing two schmelts. <STOP> <START> Where are Deetzy and Burnsy? <STOP> <START> Oh, looks like a bad case of the Native flu, bro. <STOP> <START> What's the Native flu? <STOP> <START> You're an idiot. <STOP> <START> The Natives are tough as hell. <STOP> <START> So another way to say someone is chickenshit to play them is to say they have the Native flu. <STOP> <START> Mix in a fuckin' clue, brotato chip. <STOP> <START> Keep those fucking bags up, schmelt. <STOP> <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Bonnie, how are you now? <STOP> <START> Good and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> This isn't all for you, is it? <STOP> <START> It sure is. <STOP> <START> Is it for the jamboree? <STOP> <START> If we ever get it there. <STOP> <START> Save me a dance? <STOP> <START> Yup, sure. <STOP> <START> Thank you. <STOP> <START> I've always wanted to dance with you, Wayne. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah? <STOP> <START> We've all been watching you and <START> Angie dance for so long thinking when's it gonna be our turns? <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah? <STOP> <START> But trust me, watching was enough. <STOP> <START> You used to move her body around like it didn't weigh a feather. <STOP> <START> Well, you know, I think I got about a dozen baker's dozen here I guess we could just scan them and then I'll get out of your hair. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah, I'll scan them. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> It's broken. <STOP> <START> It'll be our little secret. <STOP> <START> Okay, sit down. <STOP> <START> Oh. <STOP> <START> Stewart?

<STOP> <START> Wrong takeaway. <STOP> <START> You know, you're not a fuckin' idiot. <STOP> <START> You could turn it around if you wanted to. <STOP> <START> You know, I remember sneaking into your parties when I was 15, stealing your mixtapes. <START> All your own music. <STOP> <START> I was really impressed. <STOP> <START> Guess those days are over, though. <START> All right, Dairy, let's go. <STOP> <START> Dairy, come on. <START> And yeah. <STOP> <START> You did use to charm me. <STOP> <START> McMurray, how're ya now? <STOP> <START> Not so bad, and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> I see you back to the jamboree, now. <START> A few weeks off there. <STOP> <START> Oh, you noticed. <STOP> <START> Well, it's hard not to notice all that Scottish tartan plaid you seem to enjoy so much. <STOP> <START> I wanted to talk about something important. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> My sister Bonnie is back from college, and she's a damn fine woman. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah. <STOP> <START> I just seen her down at the dollar store, there. <STOP> <START> You sure it was her? <STOP> <START> I mean, last time I seen her last she was in a kind of a DIY maxi dress, but she may have added a crochet pattern sweater on account of the breeze. <STOP> <START> Maybe autumn foliage or an <START> Algonquin green? <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> I think she'd be a damn fine match for you, Wayne. <STOP> <START> That's if you're ready. <STOP> <START> You know, 'cause of <START> Angie and all. <STOP> <START> She's a lovely girl. <STOP> <START> No, you go ahead. <STOP> <START> That is if you. <STOP> <START> But you started, you mind finishing?

<STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Never again. <STOP> <START> Okay, okay, okay, then, can you snort it? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> I've given up on the meth business. <STOP> <START> I'm going back to the turntables. <STOP> <START> Hmm?

<STOP> <START> I don't know, what the fuck. <START> And you greenlit that tomfuckery? <STOP> <START> Had to. <START> Agricultural Hall is low on funds. <START> Allday bookings is a big boost for us. <STOP> <START> So, I couldn't say no. <START> Agricultural Halls are for <START> Agricultural music. <STOP> <START> Not for fuckin' raves. <STOP> <START> Well, that's no way to get your communication badge, boy scout. <STOP> <START> Dairy. <STOP> <START> D<START> ARYL ON. <STOP> <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Clinic. <STOP> <START> Pick up. <STOP> <START> Not feel good. <STOP> <START> Well, he's not gonna get his communication badge, either. <STOP> <START> Dairy. <STOP> <START> What's the fuss?

<STOP> <START> I'm gonna help you. <STOP> <START> You know Stewart's having a rave at the <START> Ag Hall? <START> Agricultural Halls are for agricultural music. <STOP> <START> Not for fuckin' raves. <STOP> <START> That's what I said. <STOP> <START> So here's what we're gonna do and I'm gonna tell ya. <STOP> <START> We're gonna wrangle as many of those critters as possible, and let 'em loose at Stewart's rave. <STOP> <START> How do we get the word out about the business? <STOP> <START> Oh, you'd have to put it on your fuckin' Facebook, likely. <STOP> <START> Over and out. <STOP> <START> Look at this bowl of fruit salad. <STOP> <START> You want a taste, Tanis? <STOP> <START> Ooh, better watch that bark there. <STOP> <START> Boy might get bit. <STOP> <START> What's going on here?

<STOP> <START> Everyone knows Letterkenny has gone to meth. <STOP> <START> You guys a bunch of fuckin' basics. <START> At least we keep it clean. <STOP> <START> We just sell cigarettes. <STOP> <START> Your town ain't nothing but a bunch of jackedup scab pickers. <STOP> <START> Yeah, we'll see what you're calling us after I bury a couple of bar down wristers. <STOP> <START> Halfclapper, top cheddar. <STOP> <START> Biscuits top titties, bar downskies. <START> Always bar downskie. <STOP> <START> Pull out the guns. <STOP> <START> Safetys off. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' safety off, boys. <START> A little threeononeskie? <START> A little threeontwoskie? <STOP> <START> Hum a high hard one. <STOP> <START> Hit the red light district. <STOP> <START> You won't make it that far, slugger. <STOP> <START> You either, champ. <STOP> <START> Buckets off. <STOP> <START> Center ice. <STOP> <START> Puck drop. <STOP> <START> Shed 'em. <STOP> <START> Go me. <START> A little fuck me, fuck you. <STOP> <START> Free nose jobs. <STOP> <START> Let's dance. <STOP> <START> Let's hit the dfloor. <STOP> <START> My balls dangle harder than you, boy. <STOP> <START> Like I thought, bad case of the Native flu. <STOP> <START> Devon, we're missing $2000. <STOP> <START> Really? <STOP> <START> It's a devastating blow to Menergy Spa, I know. <STOP> <START> Hey, I'll call Stewart. <STOP> <START> He'll fix everything. <STOP> <START> Hello? <STOP> <START> Stewart? <STOP> <START> Hey, Devon. <STOP> <START> Hey, we're missing 2k. <STOP> <START> Yeah, I took it for the rave. 2k? <STOP> <START> I don't think you understand. <STOP> <START> It's going to be a massive production. <STOP> <START> It's gonna be like an. <START> Aurora Borealisthemed Salvador Dali drug orgy with shamans. <STOP> <START> But that's a lot of money. <STOP> <START> No time, I gotta go. <STOP> <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Daryl. <STOP> <START> Gailor, how are ya now? <STOP> <START> I'm on a juice cleanse. <STOP> <START> Haven't had a drink in three days. <STOP> <START> Had close to 30 shits, though. <STOP> <START> So what's the fuss? <STOP> <START> Well, timing's right for your new business. <STOP> <START> Saw it up on your fuckin' Facebook, there. <STOP> <START> Got a skunk sleeping underneath us, right now. <STOP> <START> Did you not know skunks are immune to bee stings? <STOP> <START> They even teach their babies how to raid beehives. <START> And? <STOP> <START> Well, they burrow up for the winter, and rip farts on each other to keep warm. <STOP> <START> No way. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah. <STOP> <START> They go to mate as soon as they leave their mom, so you know they're probably thinking about her during sex. <STOP> <START> That or their brothers and sisters which is even more inappropriate. <STOP> <START> Oh. <STOP> <START> There's one knocking. <STOP> <START> Make way. <STOP> <START> Well, pitterpatter. <STOP> <START> Can you take this one, please? <STOP> <START> Here's the deal. <STOP> <START> Stewart's rave is eating up all our money, and the business is failing without his expertise. <STOP> <START> We simply aren't making enough coin selling the Native's cigarettes. <STOP> <START> We need the meth. <STOP> <START> Menergy Spa is never going to happen at this rate. <STOP> <START> I officially move to boycott Stewart's rave, take it off our fuckin' Facebooks and sabotage it. <START> All in favor say, <START> Aye!. <START> Aye! <STOP> <START> It's unanimous. <STOP> <START> How are we going to do this? <STOP> <START> We could put something on our Facebooks. <STOP> <START> We could say the <START> Ag Hall has asbestos. <STOP> <START> Yes, asbestos. <STOP> <START> Everyone hates asbestos. <START> Asbestos is the answer. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Let's do that. <STOP> <START> Maybe you don't say asbestos anymore, though. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Hey, Katy, you look beautiful. <STOP> <START> You look better. <STOP> <START> Um. <STOP> <START> I've come to cordially invite you to my rave tonight. <STOP> <START> Stewart. <STOP> <START> Fuck, greasiest skid I ever seen. <STOP> <START> Criss <START> Angel mindfreak lookingmotherfucker. <STOP> <START> What are you thinking holding a rave at the <START> Ag Hall? <STOP> <START> I'm thinking I'm doing the <START> Agricultural Society a huge favor. <STOP> <START> You guys are going broke. <STOP> <START> Tits up or not, it's inappropriate. <STOP> <START> Why not the Legion? <STOP> <START> Or even upstairs at the arena? <STOP> <START> Or the fuckin' youth center. <STOP> <START> Because they're too small, shirttucker. <STOP> <START> Be prepared, because once this blows up they'll probably ask me to do it quarterly. <STOP> <START> Biweekly! <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <STOP> <START> We'll see if it blows up then. <STOP> <START> It'll probably be pretty tough to find me through the crowd. <STOP> <START> Stage security will be pretty tight but your name's on the guest list, and there's a backstage pass with your name on it. <STOP> <START> I'll do my best to make it down, Stewart. <STOP> <START> My ass. <START> And just as a heads up, it is a rave, so there will probably be people on drugs. <STOP> <START> You know, MDM<START> A. <STOP> <START> What? <STOP> <START> There's gonna be MDM<START> A at the <START> Ag Hall? <STOP> <START> Yes, there will be MDM<START> A at my rave at the <START> Ag Hall. <STOP> <START> There will be MDM<START> A, DMT, PCP, LSD, LED and probably UFC. <STOP> <START> But I am clean and sober. <STOP> <START> You are spare parts, aren't you, bud? <STOP> <START> I truly hope to see you there. <STOP> <START> Watch your fuckin' hands, skid. <STOP> <START> Three, two. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' skids are turning Letterkenny into a gong show, buddy. <STOP> <START> Fucking gonger, buddy. <STOP> <START> I'm rattled about that meth chirp, brotein. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' Stewart, bro. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' Stewart, bro. <STOP> <START> There's fuckin' two in that pud, hey, boys?
