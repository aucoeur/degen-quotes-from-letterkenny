<START> A bit of fuss down at the church the other day. <START> Glen. <START> Wayne. <START> How are you now?. <START> Good, and you? <START> Oh, not so bad. <START> Ooh, look what you brought with you. <START> Hello, Daryl. <START> Oh, fuck. <START> Fuck, you're naked as a jay bird. <START> Wayne, it's humid. <START> It's the humidity. <START> Y'all might want to think about doing the same thing, just pop your pants right off, that way no one gets sticky. <START> Nope. <START> It's not so bad. <START> What's the fuss? <START> Ma O'Dell mentioned something about you helping her get a squirrel out of her attic. <START> I'm faced with a similar conundrum. <START> Right over there. <START> It seems some kinda rodent's made his home over there. <START> I have not seen him, but I sure can smell him. <START> Hum. <START> It's a possum. <START> Hmm. <START> Possum. <START> That's right. <START> Oh, pitter patter, let's get at 'er. <START> Do you wanna know what? <START> I'd reach into a pirate hooker's chamber pot before I'd reach in there. <START> And I'm going to tell ya. <START> Possums are immune to snake venom. <START> They could probably survive a nuclear blast. <START> I think it's pronounced newcuelar. <START> Mmm, but it isn't. <START> They're mutants. <START> They have forked fuckin' penises. <START> We should all be so lucky. <START> They do this thing called 'Playing Possum' where they appear dead and emit a death stink from their butt holes, fuck. <START> I found one playing possum one time, thought it was dead and buried it. <START> It dug itself out a few hours later and fucked a hen right in front of her chicks. <START> Wayne, think about the swear jar. <START> You're putting so much money in. <START> All right, let me take peek see? <START> Pitterpatter. <START> Always had a skilled hand in wrangling vermin. <START> Thank you, Daryl. <START> And that doesn't surprise me. <START> No sweat. <START> No sweat? <START> In this heat? <START> That is rich and it's funny. <START> Honestly though, just take off your jumper. <START> I'll hold it for you. <START> You crawl up in there, no one gets dirty. <START> Glen? <START> Glen? <START> Yes. <START> Let's take about 20% off 'er up there, all right? <START> Now, you wanna have an eye because he'll come out meaner and spit and go like a hot damn. <START> Is he likely to bite? <START> Is a duck's ass watertight? <START> Get ready to give him the size nine's if he jukes by me. <START> How be I give him the size twelve and a halfs instead? <START> Oh, I see him. <START> That's some drunk evolution right there, bud. <START> You gotta wonder what two Christmade miscreants mated to make that. <START> It's almost not worth thinkin' about. <START> Do I just reach for him? <START> That's a better idea than going in head first. <START> Put him where? <START> Under my boot. <START> Boys, just do your best not to make too big a mess, all right? <START> And I'm sorry again about all this heat. <START> Whoohoo! <START> Oh, for fucksakes. <START> Ow. <START> You wish there was a Pied Piper for possums, but there isn't, so you're gonna have to just keep pickin' 'em off with the .22. <START> Buckle up 'cause they're fuckin' ugly. <START> Of course, that's not to say I have it all my damn self. <START> Is that a herpe on your hand, Daryl? <START> Did you pay a little extra to go all the way with a ripper in the back room again?. <START> No, I don't think he'd make that mistake twice. <START> Got a little trouser trauma? <START> Was she fun or was she fungal? <START> Hey, guess what? <START> A guy's girlfriend is having a hard time parking the car, right? <START> He says, "You should get tested." She says, "Well no, I'm not so bad at driving." He says, "No, I have chlamydia." Is that a bite? <START> The guy takes a hooker out for supper. <START> He gave her his peas, she gave him herpes. <START> Daryl, what happened? <START> Did something bite you?. <START> A possum. <START> A possum?. <START> That's right. <START> Well, he could have rabies. <START> Boo fuckin' hoo. <START> No, rabies is serious. <START> It attacks the central nervous system. <START> If he gets puke between the floor boards it ain't coming out. <START> Well, I can't take him to the clinic. <START> I gotta do an ice run for the jamboree this week. <START> Oh, Christ. <START> Well, Daryl, we're gonna have to take your van. <START> Oh, yeah? <START> Where's your nut sack boyfriend's today, Katy? <START> They're at an away game against the Natives. <START> Oh, I bet they're looking forward to playing those tough pricks. <START> Christ. <START> You sure you're ready to saddle up to the jamboree again? <START> It was kind of you and <START> Angie's thing. <START> No sense sittin' on my hands. <START> Time to find a new dance partner. <START> All right, Daryl. <START> Pitterpatter. <START> Hey, why are crabs always so tired? <START> It's 'cause they only sleep in snatches. <START> Hey, wait a minute. <START> We're. <START> We're missing two schmelts. <START> Where are Deetzy and Burnsy? <START> Oh, looks like a bad case of the Native flu, bro. <START> What's the Native flu? <START> You're an idiot. <START> The Natives are tough as hell. <START> So another way to say someone is chickenshit to play them is to say they have the Native flu. <START> Mix in a fuckin' clue, brotato chip. <START> Keep those fucking bags up, schmelt. <START> Wayne. <START> Bonnie, how are you now? <START> Good and you? <START> Not so bad. <START> This isn't all for you, is it? <START> It sure is. <START> Is it for the jamboree? <START> If we ever get it there. <START> Save me a dance? <START> Yup, sure. <START> Thank you. <START> I've always wanted to dance with you, Wayne. <START> Oh, yeah? <START> We've all been watching you and <START> Angie dance for so long thinking when's it gonna be our turns? <START> Oh, yeah? <START> But trust me, watching was enough. <START> You used to move her body around like it didn't weigh a feather. <START> Well, you know, I think I got about a dozen baker's dozen here I guess we could just scan them and then I'll get out of your hair. <START> Oh, yeah, I'll scan them. <START> Okay. <START> It's broken. <START> It'll be our little secret. <START> Okay, sit down. <START> Oh. <START> Stewart? <START> Katy? <START> You look grisly. <START> You look beautiful. <START> But I can't quite see you right now. <START> What's wrong with you? <START> Meth?. <START> I don't know what you're talking about. <START> You're not a teenager anymore. <START> It's not charming. <START> I use to charm you? <START> Wrong takeaway. <START> You know, you're not a fuckin' idiot. <START> You could turn it around if you wanted to. <START> You know, I remember sneaking into your parties when I was 15, stealing your mixtapes. <START> All your own music. <START> I was really impressed. <START> Guess those days are over, though. <START> All right, Dairy, let's go. <START> Dairy, come on. <START> And yeah. <START> You did use to charm me. <START> McMurray, how're ya now? <START> Not so bad, and you? <START> Not so bad. <START> I see you back to the jamboree, now. <START> A few weeks off there. <START> Oh, you noticed. <START> Well, it's hard not to notice all that Scottish tartan plaid you seem to enjoy so much. <START> I wanted to talk about something important. <START> Okay. <START> My sister Bonnie is back from college, and she's a damn fine woman. <START> Oh, yeah. <START> I just seen her down at the dollar store, there. <START> You sure it was her? <START> I mean, last time I seen her last she was in a kind of a DIY maxi dress, but she may have added a crochet pattern sweater on account of the breeze. <START> Maybe autumn foliage or an <START> Algonquin green? <START> Okay. <START> I think she'd be a damn fine match for you, Wayne. <START> That's if you're ready. <START> You know, 'cause of <START> Angie and all. <START> She's a lovely girl. <START> No, you go ahead. <START> That is if you. <START> But you started, you mind finishing? <START> Oh, it's just, was gonna say the space, looks, looks nice and clean without the. <START> Yup. <START> Run pretty good. <START> Well, all right. <START> All right. <START> Yeah. <START> Hey, uh, I'll let you carry on. <START> It's a good box of ice. <START> Yeah. <START> Yeah, good to see you. <START> Have a good one. <START> Hey, wait. <START> You save her dance now, eh, big boy? <START> Good enough, McMurray. <START> Atta boy. <START> Does that taste right? <START> Ya, okay. <START> Mmm. <START> I think so, I don't know, I don't know. <START> I've had an epiphany! <START> Uh, can you taste this? <START> No. <START> Never again. <START> Okay, okay, okay, then, can you snort it? <START> No. <START> I've given up on the meth business. <START> I'm going back to the turntables. <START> Hmm? <START> Back to the ones and twos. <START> For what? <START> To become a superstar DJ. <START> Oh, okay, okay, uh. <START> But first, can you. <START> Let's just try. <START> No. <START> I need you guys to tell everyone you know that I am hosting a rave in Letterkenny, and I will be spinning under all of my aliases. <START> How many aliases have you had? <START> DJ Pimpy Longstockings, DJ Peter Blumpkin, DJ White Power Nap, DJ White Power Bottom. <START> They'll all be there!. <START> All of them. <START> Mmmmmm, so you're quitting the meth business? <START> I've quit the meth business. <START> But Menergy Spa is still like, a thing though, right? <START> Well, how are you going to get people to come? <START> I'll post it on my fuckin' Facebook. <START> And you guys will post it on your fuckin' Facebooks. <START> Wayne. <START> Christ, Katy, put some fuckin' clothes on. <START> Not my forte. <START> Unfortunate. <START> What are you doing? <START> Well, I think it's pretty obvious that I'm moving hay bales from here over to here. <START> Although, that one's a straw bale. <START> Why? <START> Well, pick up your fuckin' phone. <START> McMurray's been trying to reach you all day. <START> McMurray. <START> At least I was yesterday! <START> How're ya now? <START> Not so bad and you? <START> Not so bad. <START> Listen, Wayne. <START> I've gotta cancel the Jamboree here. <START> The <START> Ag Hall's been booked up. <START> For the whole week? <START> Yes, sir. <START> That's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and guess what else? <START> Sunday. <START> What for? <START> Uh, Stewart. <START> He's throwing a rave. <START> I don't know, he says he needs time to set up or something like that. <START> Said something about a glow stick Segway saunter across the rainbow road level of Mario Kart for Nintendo 64? <START> I don't know, what the fuck. <START> And you greenlit that tomfuckery? <START> Had to. <START> Agricultural Hall is low on funds. <START> Allday bookings is a big boost for us. <START> So, I couldn't say no. <START> Agricultural Halls are for <START> Agricultural music. <START> Not for fuckin' raves. <START> Well, that's no way to get your communication badge, boy scout. <START> Dairy. <START> D<START> ARYL ON. <START> Wayne. <START> Clinic. <START> Pick up. <START> Not feel good. <START> Well, he's not gonna get his communication badge, either. <START> Dairy. <START> What's the fuss? <START> Good 'n you? <START> Where you goin'? <START> I don't know where I am. <START> Don't look at your hand. <START> What's the fuss? <START> Think I have rabies. <START> Oh, boo fuckin' hoo, big shootsywootsy. <START> But 'cept do you wanna know what? <START> What's that? <START> Nabbing that possum was kind of a thrill. <START> I think I could start a pest removal business. <START> Oh, Daryl, that's just silly. <START> But 'cept do you wanna know what? <START> I'm gonna help you. <START> You know Stewart's having a rave at the <START> Ag Hall? <START> Agricultural Halls are for agricultural music. "Not for fuckin' raves." That's what I said. <START> So here's what we're gonna do and I'm gonna tell ya. <START> We're gonna wrangle as many of those critters as possible, and let 'em loose at Stewart's rave. <START> How do we get the word out about the business? <START> Oh, you'd have to put it on your fuckin' Facebook, likely. <START> Over and out. <START> Look at this bowl of fruit salad. <START> You want a taste, Tanis? <START> Ooh, better watch that bark there. <START> Boy might get bit. <START> What's going on here? <START> You're looking a handful short. <START> Caught a bad case of the Native flu, or what? <START> You're drunk. <START> Mix in a water. <START> Well, it's either that or you're all tweaking down that meth town you come from. <START> What did you say? <START> Everyone knows Letterkenny has gone to meth. <START> You guys a bunch of fuckin' basics. <START> At least we keep it clean. <START> We just sell cigarettes. <START> Your town ain't nothing but a bunch of jackedup scab pickers. <START> Yeah, we'll see what you're calling us after I bury a couple of bar down wristers. <START> Halfclapper, top cheddar. <START> Biscuits top titties, bar downskies. <START> Always bar downskie. <START> Pull out the guns. <START> Safetys off. <START> Fuckin' safety off, boys. <START> A little threeononeskie? <START> A little threeontwoskie? <START> Hum a high hard one. <START> Hit the red light district. <START> You won't make it that far, slugger. <START> You either, champ. <START> Buckets off. <START> Center ice. <START> Puck drop. <START> Shed 'em. <START> Go me. <START> A little fuck me, fuck you. <START> Free nose jobs. <START> Let's dance. <START> Let's hit the dfloor. <START> My balls dangle harder than you, boy. <START> Like I thought, bad case of the Native flu. <START> Devon, we're missing $2000. <START> Really? <START> It's a devastating blow to Menergy Spa, I know. <START> Hey, I'll call Stewart. <START> He'll fix everything. <START> Hello? <START> Stewart? <START> Hey, Devon. <START> Hey, we're missing 2k. <START> Yeah, I took it for the rave. 2k? <START> I don't think you understand. <START> It's going to be a massive production. <START> It's gonna be like an. <START> Aurora Borealisthemed Salvador Dali drug orgy with shamans. <START> But that's a lot of money. <START> No time, I gotta go. <START> Wayne. <START> Daryl. <START> Gailor, how are ya now? <START> I'm on a juice cleanse. <START> Haven't had a drink in three days. <START> Had close to 30 shits, though. <START> So what's the fuss? <START> Well, timing's right for your new business. <START> Saw it up on your fuckin' Facebook, there. <START> Got a skunk sleeping underneath us, right now. <START> Did you not know skunks are immune to bee stings? <START> They even teach their babies how to raid beehives. <START> And? <START> Well, they burrow up for the winter, and rip farts on each other to keep warm. <START> No way. <START> Oh, yeah. <START> They go to mate as soon as they leave their mom, so you know they're probably thinking about her during sex. <START> That or their brothers and sisters which is even more inappropriate. <START> Oh. <START> There's one knocking. <START> Make way. <START> Well, pitterpatter. <START> Can you take this one, please? <START> Here's the deal. <START> Stewart's rave is eating up all our money, and the business is failing without his expertise. <START> We simply aren't making enough coin selling the Native's cigarettes. <START> We need the meth. <START> Menergy Spa is never going to happen at this rate. <START> I officially move to boycott Stewart's rave, take it off our fuckin' Facebooks and sabotage it. <START> All in favor say, "<START> Aye!". <START> Aye! <START> It's unanimous. <START> How are we going to do this? <START> We could put something on our Facebooks. <START> We could say the <START> Ag Hall has asbestos. <START> Yes, asbestos. <START> Everyone hates asbestos. <START> Asbestos is the answer. <START> Okay. <START> Let's do that. <START> Maybe you don't say asbestos anymore, though. <START> Okay. <START> Hey, Katy, you look beautiful. <START> You look better. <START> Um. <START> I've come to cordially invite you to my rave tonight. <START> Stewart. <START> Fuck, greasiest skid I ever seen. <START> Criss <START> Angel mindfreak lookingmotherfucker. <START> What are you thinking holding a rave at the <START> Ag Hall? <START> I'm thinking I'm doing the <START> Agricultural Society a huge favor. <START> You guys are going broke. <START> Tits up or not, it's inappropriate. <START> Why not the Legion? <START> Or even upstairs at the arena? <START> Or the fuckin' youth center. <START> Because they're too small, shirttucker. <START> Be prepared, because once this blows up they'll probably ask me to do it quarterly. <START> Biweekly! <START> Mmmhmm. <START> Mmmhmm. <START> We'll see if it blows up then. <START> It'll probably be pretty tough to find me through the crowd. <START> Stage security will be pretty tight but your name's on the guest list, and there's a backstage pass with your name on it. <START> I'll do my best to make it down, Stewart. <START> My ass. <START> And just as a heads up, it is a rave, so there will probably be people on drugs. <START> You know, MDM<START> A. <START> What? <START> There's gonna be MDM<START> A at the <START> Ag Hall? <START> Yes, there will be MDM<START> A at my rave at the <START> Ag Hall. <START> There will be MDM<START> A, DMT, PCP, LSD, LED and probably UFC. <START> But I am clean and sober. <START> You are spare parts, aren't you, bud? <START> I truly hope to see you there. <START> Watch your fuckin' hands, skid. <START> Three, two. <START> Fuckin' skids are turning Letterkenny into a gong show, buddy. <START> Fucking gonger, buddy. <START> I'm rattled about that meth chirp, brotein. <START> Fuckin' Stewart, bro. <START> Fuckin' Stewart, bro. <START> There's fuckin' two in that pud, hey, boys? <START> Put 'em away like a winter coat, boys. <START> What the fuck was that? <START> That was garbage. <START> That was fuckin' pedestrian. <START> All this beaking is kiddie pool shit. <START> Is that what you want? <START> Riley, Jonesy? <START> Huh? <START> You want to get dropped off at the splash pad on the way home, eh? <START> Get mom and dad to pick you up after you all swim? <START> No running on the deck, ya fuckin' pheasants. <START> Fuck! <START> Bag skate. <START> Tomorrow, 00 a. m. <START> Fuckin' embarrassing!. <START> Hey, give your balls a tug, you titfucker! <START> Fuck! <START> You never looked so good. <START> You never felt so good. <START> I'm so proud of you, man. <START> Save me a dance, Wayne. <START> You look better. <START> Where's Stewart, buddy? <START> Where is he, bro? <START> Rave's canceled. <START> Go home. <START> Bullshit, buddy. <START> That's not what the poster says, buddy. <START> I said, it's fuckin' canceled. <START> Now quit your hollering before I get cross. <START> Hey. <START> When he give a warning, he don't repeat it. <START> Yeah. <START> Seven of us and two of you. <START> It's a good time for a donnybrook, boys. <START> Tilly time, boys. <START> What the fuck are you pheasants doing out here? <START> It's 10 minutes to curfew. <START> You think you can dog fuck all night and then dance? <START> Dog fuckin' means no dancin'. <START> Get home! <START> It's fuckin' embarrassing. <START> Well, pitterpatter. <START> This isn't over. <START> Jinx, you owe me a Coke. <START> Christ. <START> McMurray. <START> MCMURR<START> AY : Wayne, I've been told the rave was a bust. <START> Something about an asbestos scare or something. <START> No one showed up. <START> Sister Bonnie, though, she's still in there. <START> About that dance you were going to save her. <START> She'll be in a sort of golden poppy progressive onesie. <START> Either way, you know, get in there, pal. <START> Give 'er the guts. <START> Okay. <START> Bang the very guts right out of her. <START> Okay. <START> Just have at her, bud, like. <START> The nutsack. <START> Alley oop. <START> This is a grotesquerie. <START> It's off. <START> We are going to make Letterkenny the biggest meth town in the whole country. <START> I love Stewart!
