<START> A bit of fuss down at the church the other day. <STOP> <START> Glen. <STOP> <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> How are you now?. <STOP> <START> Good, and you? <STOP> <START> Oh, not so bad. <STOP> <START> Ooh, look what you brought with you. <STOP> <START> Hello, Daryl. <STOP> <START> Oh, fuck. <STOP> <START> Fuck, you're naked as a jay bird. <STOP> <START> Wayne, it's humid. <STOP> <START> It's the humidity. <STOP> <START> Y'all might want to think about doing the same thing, just pop your pants right off, that way no one gets sticky. <STOP> <START> Nope. <STOP> <START> It's not so bad. <STOP> <START> What's the fuss? <STOP> <START> Ma O'Dell mentioned something about you helping her get a squirrel out of her attic. <STOP> <START> I'm faced with a similar conundrum. <STOP> <START> Right over there. <STOP> <START> It seems some kinda rodent's made his home over there. <STOP> <START> I have not seen him, but I sure can smell him. <STOP> <START> Hum. <STOP> <START> It's a possum. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> Possum. <STOP> <START> That's right. <STOP> <START> Oh, pitter patter, let's get at 'er. <STOP> <START> Do you wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I'd reach into a pirate hooker's chamber pot before I'd reach in there. <START> And I'm going to tell ya. <STOP> <START> Possums are immune to snake venom. <STOP> <START> They could probably survive a nuclear blast. <STOP> <START> I think it's pronounced newcuelar. <STOP> <START> Mmm, but it isn't. <STOP> <START> They're mutants. <STOP> <START> They have forked fuckin' penises. <STOP> <START> We should all be so lucky. <STOP> <START> They do this thing called 'Playing Possum' where they appear dead and emit a death stink from their butt holes, fuck. <STOP> <START> I found one playing possum one time, thought it was dead and buried it. <STOP> <START> It dug itself out a few hours later and fucked a hen right in front of her chicks. <STOP> <START> Wayne, think about the swear jar. <STOP> <START> You're putting so much money in. <START> All right, let me take peek see? <STOP> <START> Pitterpatter. <START> Always had a skilled hand in wrangling vermin. <STOP> <START> Thank you, Daryl. <START> And that doesn't surprise me. <STOP> <START> No sweat. <STOP> <START> No sweat? <STOP> <START> In this heat? <STOP> <START> That is rich and it's funny. <STOP> <START> Honestly though, just take off your jumper. <STOP> <START> I'll hold it for you. <STOP> <START> You crawl up in there, no one gets dirty. <STOP> <START> Glen? <STOP> <START> Glen? <STOP> <START> Yes. <STOP> <START> Let's take about 20% off 'er up there, all right? <STOP> <START> Now, you wanna have an eye because he'll come out meaner and spit and go like a hot damn. <STOP> <START> Is he likely to bite? <STOP> <START> Is a duck's ass watertight? <STOP> <START> Get ready to give him the size nine's if he jukes by me. <STOP> <START> How be I give him the size twelve and a halfs instead? <STOP> <START> Oh, I see him. <STOP> <START> That's some drunk evolution right there, bud. <STOP> <START> You gotta wonder what two Christmade miscreants mated to make that. <STOP> <START> It's almost not worth thinkin' about. <STOP> <START> Do I just reach for him? <STOP> <START> That's a better idea than going in head first. <STOP> <START> Put him where? <STOP> <START> Under my boot. <STOP> <START> Boys, just do your best not to make too big a mess, all right? <START> And I'm sorry again about all this heat. <STOP> <START> Whoohoo! <STOP> <START> Oh, for fucksakes. <STOP> <START> Ow. <STOP> <START> You wish there was a Pied Piper for possums, but there isn't, so you're gonna have to just keep pickin' 'em off with the .22. <STOP> <START> Buckle up 'cause they're fuckin' ugly. <STOP> <START> Of course, that's not to say I have it all my damn self. <STOP> <START> Is that a herpe on your hand, Daryl? <STOP> <START> Did you pay a little extra to go all the way with a ripper in the back room again?. <STOP> <START> No, I don't think he'd make that mistake twice. <STOP> <START> Got a little trouser trauma? <STOP> <START> Was she fun or was she fungal? <STOP> <START> Hey, guess what? <START> A guy's girlfriend is having a hard time parking the car, right? <STOP> <START> He says, You should get tested. <STOP> <START> She says, Well no, I'm not so bad at driving. <STOP> <START> He says, No, I have chlamydia. <STOP> <START> Is that a bite? <STOP> <START> The guy takes a hooker out for supper. <STOP> <START> He gave her his peas, she gave him herpes. <STOP> <START> Daryl, what happened? <STOP> <START> Did something bite you?. <START> A possum. <START> A possum?. <STOP> <START> That's right. <STOP> <START> Well, he could have rabies. <STOP> <START> Boo fuckin' hoo. <STOP> <START> No, rabies is serious. <STOP> <START> It attacks the central nervous system. <STOP> <START> If he gets puke between the floor boards it ain't coming out. <STOP> <START> Well, I can't take him to the clinic. <STOP> <START> I gotta do an ice run for the jamboree this week. <STOP> <START> Oh, Christ. <STOP> <START> Well, Daryl, we're gonna have to take your van. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah? <STOP> <START> Where's your nut sack boyfriend's today, Katy? <STOP> <START> They're at an away game against the Natives. <STOP> <START> Oh, I bet they're looking forward to playing those tough pricks. <STOP> <START> Christ. <STOP> <START> You sure you're ready to saddle up to the jamboree again? <STOP> <START> It was kind of you and <START> Angie's thing. <STOP> <START> No sense sittin' on my hands. <STOP> <START> Time to find a new dance partner. <START> All right, Daryl. <STOP> <START> Pitterpatter. <STOP> <START> Hey, why are crabs always so tired? <STOP> <START> It's 'cause they only sleep in snatches. <STOP> <START> Hey, wait a minute. <STOP> <START> We're. <STOP> <START> We're missing two schmelts. <STOP> <START> Where are Deetzy and Burnsy? <STOP> <START> Oh, looks like a bad case of the Native flu, bro. <STOP> <START> What's the Native flu? <STOP> <START> You're an idiot. <STOP> <START> The Natives are tough as hell. <STOP> <START> So another way to say someone is chickenshit to play them is to say they have the Native flu. <STOP> <START> Mix in a fuckin' clue, brotato chip. <STOP> <START> Keep those fucking bags up, schmelt. <STOP> <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Bonnie, how are you now? <STOP> <START> Good and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> This isn't all for you, is it? <STOP> <START> It sure is. <STOP> <START> Is it for the jamboree? <STOP> <START> If we ever get it there. <STOP> <START> Save me a dance? <STOP> <START> Yup, sure. <STOP> <START> Thank you. <STOP> <START> I've always wanted to dance with you, Wayne. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah? <STOP> <START> We've all been watching you and <START> Angie dance for so long thinking when's it gonna be our turns? <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah? <STOP> <START> But trust me, watching was enough. <STOP> <START> You used to move her body around like it didn't weigh a feather. <STOP> <START> Well, you know, I think I got about a dozen baker's dozen here I guess we could just scan them and then I'll get out of your hair. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah, I'll scan them. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> It's broken. <STOP> <START> It'll be our little secret. <STOP> <START> Okay, sit down. <STOP> <START> Oh. <STOP> <START> Stewart? <STOP> <START> Katy? <STOP> <START> You look grisly. <STOP> <START> You look beautiful. <STOP> <START> But I can't quite see you right now. <STOP> <START> What's wrong with you? <STOP> <START> Meth?. <STOP> <START> I don't know what you're talking about. <STOP> <START> You're not a teenager anymore. <STOP> <START> It's not charming. <STOP> <START> I use to charm you? <STOP> <START> Wrong takeaway. <STOP> <START> You know, you're not a fuckin' idiot. <STOP> <START> You could turn it around if you wanted to. <STOP> <START> You know, I remember sneaking into your parties when I was 15, stealing your mixtapes. <START> All your own music. <STOP> <START> I was really impressed. <STOP> <START> Guess those days are over, though. <START> All right, Dairy, let's go. <STOP> <START> Dairy, come on. <START> And yeah. <STOP> <START> You did use to charm me. <STOP> <START> McMurray, how're ya now? <STOP> <START> Not so bad, and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> I see you back to the jamboree, now. <START> A few weeks off there. <STOP> <START> Oh, you noticed. <STOP> <START> Well, it's hard not to notice all that Scottish tartan plaid you seem to enjoy so much. <STOP> <START> I wanted to talk about something important. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> My sister Bonnie is back from college, and she's a damn fine woman. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah. <STOP> <START> I just seen her down at the dollar store, there. <STOP> <START> You sure it was her? <STOP> <START> I mean, last time I seen her last she was in a kind of a DIY maxi dress, but she may have added a crochet pattern sweater on account of the breeze. <STOP> <START> Maybe autumn foliage or an <START> Algonquin green? <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> I think she'd be a damn fine match for you, Wayne. <STOP> <START> That's if you're ready. <STOP> <START> You know, 'cause of <START> Angie and all. <STOP> <START> She's a lovely girl. <STOP> <START> No, you go ahead. <STOP> <START> That is if you. <STOP> <START> But you started, you mind finishing? <STOP> <START> Oh, it's just, was gonna say the space, looks, looks nice and clean without the. <STOP> <START> Yup. <STOP> <START> Run pretty good. <STOP> <START> Well, all right. <START> All right. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Hey, uh, I'll let you carry on. <STOP> <START> It's a good box of ice. <STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Yeah, good to see you. <STOP> <START> Have a good one. <STOP> <START> Hey, wait. <STOP> <START> You save her dance now, eh, big boy? <STOP> <START> Good enough, McMurray. <START> Atta boy. <STOP> <START> Does that taste right? <STOP> <START> Ya, okay. <STOP> <START> Mmm. <STOP> <START> I think so, I don't know, I don't know. <STOP> <START> I've had an epiphany! <STOP> <START> Uh, can you taste this? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Never again. <STOP> <START> Okay, okay, okay, then, can you snort it? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> I've given up on the meth business. <STOP> <START> I'm going back to the turntables. <STOP> <START> Hmm? <STOP> <START> Back to the ones and twos. <STOP> <START> For what? <STOP> <START> To become a superstar DJ. <STOP> <START> Oh, okay, okay, uh. <STOP> <START> But first, can you. <STOP> <START> Let's just try. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> I need you guys to tell everyone you know that I am hosting a rave in Letterkenny, and I will be spinning under all of my aliases. <STOP> <START> How many aliases have you had? <STOP> <START> DJ Pimpy Longstockings, DJ Peter Blumpkin, DJ White Power Nap, DJ White Power Bottom. <STOP> <START> They'll all be there!. <START> All of them. <STOP> <START> Mmmmmm, so you're quitting the meth business?

<STOP> <START> Well, I think it's pretty obvious that I'm moving hay bales from here over to here. <START> Although, that one's a straw bale. <STOP> <START> Why? <STOP> <START> Well, pick up your fuckin' phone. <STOP> <START> McMurray's been trying to reach you all day. <STOP> <START> McMurray. <START> At least I was yesterday! <STOP> <START> How're ya now? <STOP> <START> Not so bad and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> Listen, Wayne. <STOP> <START> I've gotta cancel the Jamboree here. <STOP> <START> The <START> Ag Hall's been booked up. <STOP> <START> For the whole week? <STOP> <START> Yes, sir. <STOP> <START> That's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and guess what else? <STOP> <START> Sunday. <STOP> <START> What for? <STOP> <START> Uh, Stewart. <STOP> <START> He's throwing a rave. <STOP> <START> I don't know, he says he needs time to set up or something like that. <STOP> <START> Said something about a glow stick Segway saunter across the rainbow road level of Mario Kart for Nintendo 64? <STOP> <START> I don't know, what the fuck. <START> And you greenlit that tomfuckery? <STOP> <START> Had to. <START> Agricultural Hall is low on funds. <START> Allday bookings is a big boost for us. <STOP> <START> So, I couldn't say no. <START> Agricultural Halls are for <START> Agricultural music. <STOP> <START> Not for fuckin' raves. <STOP> <START> Well, that's no way to get your communication badge, boy scout. <STOP> <START> Dairy. <STOP> <START> D<START> ARYL ON. <STOP> <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Clinic. <STOP> <START> Pick up. <STOP> <START> Not feel good. <STOP> <START> Well, he's not gonna get his communication badge, either. <STOP> <START> Dairy. <STOP> <START> What's the fuss?

<STOP> <START> What's that? <STOP> <START> Nabbing that possum was kind of a thrill. <STOP> <START> I think I could start a pest removal business. <STOP> <START> Oh, Daryl, that's just silly. <STOP> <START> But 'cept do you wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I'm gonna help you. <STOP> <START> You know Stewart's having a rave at the <START> Ag Hall? <START> Agricultural Halls are for agricultural music. <STOP> <START> Not for fuckin' raves. <STOP> <START> That's what I said. <STOP> <START> So here's what we're gonna do and I'm gonna tell ya. <STOP> <START> We're gonna wrangle as many of those critters as possible, and let 'em loose at Stewart's rave. <STOP> <START> How do we get the word out about the business? <STOP> <START> Oh, you'd have to put it on your fuckin' Facebook, likely. <STOP> <START> Over and out. <STOP> <START> Look at this bowl of fruit salad. <STOP> <START> You want a taste, Tanis? <STOP> <START> Ooh, better watch that bark there. <STOP> <START> Boy might get bit. <STOP> <START> What's going on here? <STOP> <START> You're looking a handful short. <STOP> <START> Caught a bad case of the Native flu, or what? <STOP> <START> You're drunk. <STOP> <START> Mix in a water. <STOP> <START> Well, it's either that or you're all tweaking down that meth town you come from. <STOP> <START> What did you say? <STOP> <START> Everyone knows Letterkenny has gone to meth. <STOP> <START> You guys a bunch of fuckin' basics. <START> At least we keep it clean. <STOP> <START> We just sell cigarettes. <STOP> <START> Your town ain't nothing but a bunch of jackedup scab pickers. <STOP> <START> Yeah, we'll see what you're calling us after I bury a couple of bar down wristers. <STOP> <START> Halfclapper, top cheddar. <STOP> <START> Biscuits top titties, bar downskies. <START> Always bar downskie. <STOP> <START> Pull out the guns. <STOP> <START> Safetys off. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' safety off, boys. <START> A little threeononeskie? <START> A little threeontwoskie? <STOP> <START> Hum a high hard one. <STOP> <START> Hit the red light district. <STOP> <START> You won't make it that far, slugger. <STOP> <START> You either, champ. <STOP> <START> Buckets off. <STOP> <START> Center ice. <STOP> <START> Puck drop. <STOP> <START> Shed 'em. <STOP> <START> Go me. <START> A little fuck me, fuck you. <STOP> <START> Free nose jobs. <STOP> <START> Let's dance. <STOP> <START> Let's hit the dfloor. <STOP> <START> My balls dangle harder than you, boy. <STOP> <START> Like I thought, bad case of the Native flu. <STOP> <START> Devon, we're missing $2000. <STOP> <START> Really? <STOP> <START> It's a devastating blow to Menergy Spa, I know. <STOP> <START> Hey, I'll call Stewart. <STOP> <START> He'll fix everything. <STOP> <START> Hello? <STOP> <START> Stewart? <STOP> <START> Hey, Devon. <STOP> <START> Hey, we're missing 2k. <STOP> <START> Yeah, I took it for the rave. 2k? <STOP> <START> I don't think you understand. <STOP> <START> It's going to be a massive production. <STOP> <START> It's gonna be like an. <START> Aurora Borealisthemed Salvador Dali drug orgy with shamans. <STOP> <START> But that's a lot of money. <STOP> <START> No time, I gotta go. <STOP> <START> Wayne. <STOP> <START> Daryl. <STOP> <START> Gailor, how are ya now? <STOP> <START> I'm on a juice cleanse. <STOP> <START> Haven't had a drink in three days. <STOP> <START> Had close to 30 shits, though. <STOP> <START> So what's the fuss? <STOP> <START> Well, timing's right for your new business. <STOP> <START> Saw it up on your fuckin' Facebook, there. <STOP> <START> Got a skunk sleeping underneath us, right now. <STOP> <START> Did you not know skunks are immune to bee stings? <STOP> <START> They even teach their babies how to raid beehives. <START> And? <STOP> <START> Well, they burrow up for the winter, and rip farts on each other to keep warm. <STOP> <START> No way. <STOP> <START> Oh, yeah. <STOP> <START> They go to mate as soon as they leave their mom, so you know they're probably thinking about her during sex. <STOP> <START> That or their brothers and sisters which is even more inappropriate. <STOP> <START> Oh. <STOP> <START> There's one knocking. <STOP> <START> Make way. <STOP> <START> Well, pitterpatter. <STOP> <START> Can you take this one, please? <STOP> <START> Here's the deal. <STOP> <START> Stewart's rave is eating up all our money, and the business is failing without his expertise. <STOP> <START> We simply aren't making enough coin selling the Native's cigarettes. <STOP> <START> We need the meth. <STOP> <START> Menergy Spa is never going to happen at this rate. <STOP> <START> I officially move to boycott Stewart's rave, take it off our fuckin' Facebooks and sabotage it. <START> All in favor say, <START> Aye!. <START> Aye! <STOP> <START> It's unanimous. <STOP> <START> How are we going to do this? <STOP> <START> We could put something on our Facebooks. <STOP> <START> We could say the <START> Ag Hall has asbestos. <STOP> <START> Yes, asbestos. <STOP> <START> Everyone hates asbestos. <START> Asbestos is the answer. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Let's do that. <STOP> <START> Maybe you don't say asbestos anymore, though. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Hey, Katy, you look beautiful. <STOP> <START> You look better. <STOP> <START> Um. <STOP> <START> I've come to cordially invite you to my rave tonight. <STOP> <START> Stewart. <STOP> <START> Fuck, greasiest skid I ever seen. <STOP> <START> Criss <START> Angel mindfreak lookingmotherfucker. <STOP> <START> What are you thinking holding a rave at the <START> Ag Hall? <STOP> <START> I'm thinking I'm doing the <START> Agricultural Society a huge favor. <STOP> <START> You guys are going broke. <STOP> <START> Tits up or not, it's inappropriate. <STOP> <START> Why not the Legion? <STOP> <START> Or even upstairs at the arena? <STOP> <START> Or the fuckin' youth center. <STOP> <START> Because they're too small, shirttucker. <STOP> <START> Be prepared, because once this blows up they'll probably ask me to do it quarterly. <STOP> <START> Biweekly! <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <STOP> <START> Mmmhmm. <STOP> <START> We'll see if it blows up then. <STOP> <START> It'll probably be pretty tough to find me through the crowd. <STOP> <START> Stage security will be pretty tight but your name's on the guest list, and there's a backstage pass with your name on it. <STOP> <START> I'll do my best to make it down, Stewart. <STOP> <START> My ass. <START> And just as a heads up, it is a rave, so there will probably be people on drugs. <STOP> <START> You know, MDM<START> A. <STOP> <START> What? <STOP> <START> There's gonna be MDM<START> A at the <START> Ag Hall? <STOP> <START> Yes, there will be MDM<START> A at my rave at the <START> Ag Hall. <STOP> <START> There will be MDM<START> A, DMT, PCP, LSD, LED and probably UFC. <STOP> <START> But I am clean and sober. <STOP> <START> You are spare parts, aren't you, bud? <STOP> <START> I truly hope to see you there. <STOP> <START> Watch your fuckin' hands, skid. <STOP> <START> Three, two. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' skids are turning Letterkenny into a gong show, buddy. <STOP> <START> Fucking gonger, buddy. <STOP> <START> I'm rattled about that meth chirp, brotein. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' Stewart, bro. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' Stewart, bro. <STOP> <START> There's fuckin' two in that pud, hey, boys?
