<STOP> <START> Yes? <STOP> <START> I didn't know it was necessary, much less important. <STOP> <START> The point is the government is trying to keep you and your humble agricultural livelihoods thoroughly cucked. <STOP> <START> It's time to wake up and smell the chem trails. <STOP> <START> It's time to stand up for your God given right to have kickass names for all your favorite teams, and fuck anybody whose feelings get hurt along the way. <STOP> <START> Oh, is that what time it is? <STOP> <START> Oh, you think I don't have feelings? <STOP> <START> You think my feelings don't get hurt? <STOP> <START> My grandfather has a pacemaker, right? <STOP> <START> Every time I watch the Indiana Pacers play basketball, it makes me think of Papi. <STOP> <START> And his irregular heartbeat. <STOP> <START> And it fucks me up, big time. <STOP> <START> You see me complaining to the Indiana Pacers or anyone in the NBA?

<STOP> <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Me too, buddy. <STOP> <START> I mean, if we're talking about some kind of negative stereotype attached to that name, you know? <STOP> <START> Right? <STOP> <START> It's like, just because my name is Reilly, that doesn't necessarily mean that I'm a drunken leprechaun. <STOP> <START> Maybe we should change the name, buddy. <START> What's this about a name change? <STOP> <START> If anybody should change their names, it should be us. <START> What the hell's a Shamrockette anyway? <STOP> <START> A leaf with tits? <STOP> <START> Oh, this isn't your matriarch, is it? <STOP> <START> You can't just add ette to the end of the men's team and expect women to like it. <START> We should change our names to something fierce and feminine and powerful. <STOP> <START> Like the Screaming Banshees. <STOP> <START> That's good, MaryAnne. <STOP> <START> Impressive creativity. <STOP> <START> Couple of hens clucking away. <STOP> <START> Especially for a girl who had to start kindergarten two years late because she couldn't grasp coloring. <STOP> <START> I've plenty of good ideas, BettyAnne. <STOP> <START> Like convincing your dad to get a vasectomy so I wouldn't have to worry about another you coming into the world while I fucked him. <START> We were just starting to get them under control. <STOP> <START> You're screwing it up, bro. <STOP> <START> You're getting them all fired up again. <STOP> <START> Bringing family into it now, MaryAnne? <STOP> <START> I would never stoop so low, especially with the recent passing of your mother, who told me before she died that my dad is your dad too. <STOP> <START> You're fucking up our progress, man. <STOP> <START> Just get out of here. <STOP> <START> It's only gonna get worse too. <STOP> <START> Thanks a lot. <STOP> <START> Ah, these Tumblrinas have lost the plot anyway. <STOP> <START> Letterkenny Chiefs! <STOP> <START> Letterkenny Chiefs! <START> Where the fuck is everybody?

traditional values, traditional morals. <START> We share a very antiimmigration stance. <STOP> <START> You know, if you think about it, we actually share a lot of common ground. <STOP> <START> Historically, sharing ground hasn't been your strong suit. <STOP> <START> If you guys are here, then who's jerking off in your mom's basement? <STOP> <START> Somewhere there's a men's rights meeting missing their door greeters. <STOP> <START> Yeah, look. <STOP> <START> I get it. <STOP> <START> You're frustrated. <STOP> <START> It must be really exhausting never paying taxes your whole lives.

<STOP> <START> If anybody should change their names, it should be us. <START> What the hell's a Shamrockette anyway? <STOP> <START> A leaf with tits? <STOP> <START> Oh, this isn't your matriarch, is it? <STOP> <START> You can't just add ette to the end of the men's team and expect women to like it. <START> We should change our names to something fierce and feminine and powerful. <STOP> <START> Like the Screaming Banshees. <STOP> <START> That's good, MaryAnne. <STOP> <START> Impressive creativity. <STOP> <START> Couple of hens clucking away. <STOP> <START> Especially for a girl who had to start kindergarten two years late because she couldn't grasp coloring. <STOP> <START> I've plenty of good ideas, BettyAnne. <STOP> <START> Like convincing your dad to get a vasectomy so I wouldn't have to worry about another you coming into the world while I fucked him. <START> We were just starting to get them under control. <STOP> <START> You're screwing it up, bro. <STOP> <START> You're getting them all fired up again. <STOP> <START> Bringing family into it now, MaryAnne?

traditional values, traditional morals. <START> We share a very antiimmigration stance. <STOP> <START> You know, if you think about it, we actually share a lot of common ground. <STOP> <START> Historically, sharing ground hasn't been your strong suit. <STOP> <START> If you guys are here, then who's jerking off in your mom's basement? <STOP> <START> Somewhere there's a men's rights meeting

<STOP> <START> Like toque or mittens. <STOP> <START> And then, if you really wanna double down on it, you put something outdoorsy in the name because people love being outdoors. <STOP> <START> Like, lake, or mountains. <STOP> <START> So what it's really gonna boil down to is Toque Lake Brew co, or Mountain Mittens Alpine Ale. <STOP> <START> Blanket Fire Light. <STOP> <START> There you go, Dary. <STOP> <START> The other ways to go is to use a clever, but ironical statement. <STOP> <START> Like, I'm bitters. <STOP> <START> See, I'd go suggestive. <STOP> <START> Like, Slipitin cider. <STOP> <START> Katy. <STOP> <START> What?
