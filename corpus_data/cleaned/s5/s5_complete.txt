We went shopping for a whiskey night the other day. That's a big fuckoff bottle of Gus N' Bru. It's better to be looking at it then looking for it. You boys getting into it tonight? Yeah, it's a Texassized tenfour. That's a Texassized twosix. That's a Texas Micky, super shooters, let's get cracking. Wayne. What's the problem, Katy? It happened again. What did? Gus left a Mr. Big on the floor this morning. No, he never. He dropped a Hershey bar in the living room just last Tuesday, although upon closer inspection, it did look more like a Hershey's mint. Well, I'd sooner believe that was you, Squirrelly Dan. So watch how you speak on his name, you know? Hey, buddy. He left a Twix on the floor just yesterday. And what made it a Twix as opposed to a Big Turk, Dary? Well, there were two of 'em. They're identical, and they're side by each. Over and out. How would you ask somebody if you wanted just one of their Twix's? Well, just what you said. Can I have one of your Twix's? No, it'd be. Could I have a Twick? In any event, it's starting to look like Willy Wonka's emptying his pockets around your house, good buddy. Now, you's realize the weight of these allegations. These accusations. Can confirm. And you's realize the consequences at hand should your claim be false. Claims is's this. Can confirm's. I'll only give you's one more chance to retract. No questions asked. Before this conversation becomes a confrontation. We wouldn't be bringing it to you if it weren't worth being brought'en. But. Bring it on. Oh, it has been broughten. I'm just kidding around. He's a tenyearold boy, now. He's made me proud for a goddamn decade. He's been a real good bo. He's been such a bo. But he's a senior now. He's on the home stretch, and I'm trying to let him enjoy it. Snoozin' on the furniture, lots of human food. Leash is so long now, she's limp. And he's earned it. So you're just gonna let him drop Baby Ruth's all over the house? As opposed to what, Katy? Just give him a real good, stern talking to. Oh, yeah, and how's that gonna shake down? He's probably half fuckin' deaf. Aren't you, you fuckin' geezer? The same way it shook down for the last decade before you stopped disciplining him, just 'cause he's old. Okay, Katy. Katy, okay, I'm going in. Wish me luck. All right, was that you leaving Crispy Crunchers all over the floor? 'Cause that's a bad dog, don't you do that again, that's bad. Licketysplit. Ah, that's a wee bit aggressive. Oh is that what I'm being, Dary? Well, that's your pal you're talking to over there, fairly accusatory. I'd say give him benefit of the doubt. I wouldn't. Well, you didn't even ask him if he did it there. You just assumed, I think you're better than that. Okay, Dary. Dary, okay, I'm going back in, wish me luck. Aye. Was that you leaving Jersey Milks on the floor? Because that's bad, if that was you, that was bad. Don't you do that again ever, 'cause I'll be there. You're not taking this seriously. Oh, is that what I'm not doing, Katy? No, you're joking around and he knows it. It's, Bad boy, this is a bad boy. Hey, he knows that I'm joking but he doesn't know that you're joking. Don't say bad unless you mean bad. I'm sorry, Gus. That's okay, he's a good boy, he's such a boy. Why don't you just try using your real voice? It may permeate better. Okay, Katy. Katy, okay, I'm going back in. Wish me luck. Hey, bud. I noticed that you've been leaving Caramilks all over the floor, you know what's gonna happen? Someone's gonna step on one in the night and take a header, someone's gonna pull a full gainer down the stairs. Or at the very least, a half gainer. So what you wanna do is do that outside like a good boy. Please and thanks. I thinks we're almost there. Oh, is that where we almost are, Squirrelly Dan? Now, Professor Tricia says that when you're bringing a complaints to someone, they'll be more receptive to altering their behavior if you make it your problem. Make it personal rather than placing the blames on them. What are you fuckin' getting on about over there? May I's? Okay, Dan. Dan, okay. Go on in, good luck. Gus, how are you now? Now, we've all noticed the Coffee Crisps around the house, and that's completely natural and nothing for youse to be embarrassed about. But I am quite worried I am going to slip on one and take a full gainer, or. Please look at me when I'm talking, Gus. Now, while I know that that is my problem, I know you don't want this to happen any more than I do. So I'm hoping we can works together to find a resolution to this problem. But besides that, we want you to know, we think you're doing a terrific job around here and we don't want to bothers you anymore than we needs to, so you have yourself a great day. I'm not going to make you sit through that buttfuckery, Bud, away you go. You're a good boy, away you go. Away you go. Look, I know he's just snoozing on the furniture all day, but you take him out for routine number twos. Tenfour? You try taking him out, Katy, he don't wanna. You can say, Hey, Gus, wanna rock one? And if he could talk, he'd say, I've had to rock one for a good seven, eight hours. Don't worry about that right now. I'm gonna grab another quick 20, 25 shuteye here, we'll circle back on the conversation later. But how about some good itchings and scratchings in the meantime? Whoo! Smells like Mr. Wonka's just emptied his pockets in the other room. Fuck. Well, everybody up, help me look. Better to be looking at it, than looking for it, eh? Ladies. Women. It has come to our attention that there may be a young man who has come between you girls. I mean. How do you mean? Well, BettyAnne, MaryAnne. We were told that you may be going for the same guy. Or, or that the same guy may be going for both of you. Impossible. How do you mean? The last guy that was into MaryAnne was the priest at Catholic school in grade six. And only 'cause he thought she was a boy. Well done, BettyAnne. Catholic school, grade six. Isn't that the same year you got the nickname Fisted Sister? Which you gave yourself? Ladies. Women. And a fitting nickname it was, BettyAnne. Your mitt looks like a boa constrictor unhinged its jaw in an effort to consume a combat submarine. BETTY Speaking of consumption, your mitt looks like the drooping jowls of a sharpei with a palsy and a water wing in its mouth. Your mitt looks like the back of Kelsey Grammer's head circa Frasier '94 if the cast each autographed his bald spot with multicolored lipsticks. Your mitt has more spiderwebs than a No Doubt set list, MaryAnne. BettyAnne, your mitt is so dusty, I can hear it singing Son of a Preacher Man. We've gotta go to the source, buddy. It's our only hope, buddy. Ferda. (FARTS, PLOPPING). I'm not helping you titfuckers or those twats. Give your balls a tug. We're at the bottom of the line here, Shoresy. You wanna talk about lines, you fuckin' loser? I woke up to your mum rippin' dickdingers off my foreskin, tell her to keep her hands off my scoops. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, Jonesy, I made your mum cum so hard they made a Canadian Heritage Minute out of it and Don McKellar played my dick. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, Reilly. I made your mum so wet, Trudeau deployed a 24hour infantry unit to stack sand bags around my bed. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you both, your lives are so fuckin' pathetic, I ran a charity 15K to raise awareness for it, you fuckin' losers. Where is he? He was supposed to be here an hour ago. Everyone stay composed. I'm going to sever Everett's phalanges one by one, and forcefeed them to him, fondue style. Your terms are not acceptable, Roald. I'm going to rip off his ears and use them to tickle his taint. Oh, Jesus Christ. I'm going to scalp him of his skin, wear it like a costume, and perform The Rocky Horror Picture Show in its entirety, while he watches. I need to lie down. The end is nigh. Stewart! Would you come down here, please? Everett. Hey, dude. Did you hear all of that? Bits and pieces, something about a picture show in the Rockies. Everett. Give me the. Stewart. Glen? Stewart. Glen. This is. No it's not! .an intervention. Roald. Stewart. Roald! Stewart. Unhand Roaldie. Come. Sit. Stay. But. But. Oh, I like you. You're coming with me and Glen. Where? To a place where you can get away. Yeah. You can't mean. Oh, yes, Stewart. You don't mean. Yes, Stewart. No! Stewart. You're going to rehab. No! Yes. No. Yes. No! Yes. Ladies. Women. Sorry. It's okay. Um, we spoke with Shoresy. You did? And? And he, um. What? He said. What? He said you suck at hockey. Huh? Yeah, he said you should stick to Ringette. Huh? Yeah, he said that you should never ever let a woman do a man's job. He did?. Yeah. I was standing there like, What is this guy saying? And then he said, Who let the broads out of the kitchen? He did not. Yeah. And we were like, What? You can't say that. And he's like, Yeah, I can. They should be making me my supper. And I was, Whoa, dude. Did he? Yeah. I mean, we're like, Dude, you're crazy. Then he said, I mean, how'd they find time for hockey, while they're cleaning the floors and doing my laundry. Did he? Yeah, and that's not even. That's not even the craziest part. Like we were. And believe us, we had had enough at this point, but we were like, Are you sure about this? And he was like, Anybody can go backtoback. Yeah, and we're like, Dude, you better stop talking about those girls like that. Mmm. Better stop talking about those women like that. But he said, Talk to me when they go backtoback toback. That's what he said. MaryAnne. BettyAnne. What rhymes with hip, lip and dip? Ship. What rhymes with coat, note and tote? Boat. Why don't you say you, me and the girls put another one on the water? Backtobacktoback! You're driving. Would if I could, but I can't. Okay. You boys leaning into one tonight? Well, it's better to be looking at it than looking for it. How about our very own Shamrockettes? Playing for the fuckin' 'ship. When a local team plays for the championship, that's something the whole town can get behind. Creates a pretty good sense of community, too. And a series sweeps, no less. A wee bit of Meryl Sweep. Sweep in wolf's clothing. The lion sweeps tonight. Drive safe. Stewart gets out of rehab today, so I'm keeping it local. Pitterpatter. Wayne. Dwayne. Daryl. Cheryl. Dan. Pam. See youse brought your brooms. Shop's nothing but a couple sideroads down, though. Oh, youse didn't hear? We're working for Sweep Country Canada now. Don't fear the sweeper. Why don't you use those brooms and show us that little dance those fellows do in Mary Poppins? If we offer you a beer are we sweeping with the enemies, or. You should've used those brooms to sweep the cobwebs off of Letterkenny's trophy case. Well, it's good you got the beer sorted, but is that Donegal tap water still stinky, or. Youse got a liberal amount of beer there, not sure it's gonna be enough to drown your sorrows after we shitkick youse today. Youse are on the brink of elimination, read it and sweep. Hey. Win or lose, youse guys have still got the most ostrichfuckers per capita, right? That's the big picture. Allegedlys. Bet you wish you could put your head in the sand and ignore that one, huh? May the best town win. Ladies. None finer than you, MaryAnne. Women. None more admirable than you, BettyAnne. We've overcome adversity. Found a way to win. Let's get this fucking win, let's get this fucking sweep! And let's get this luxury fucking sea liner on the lake! League final, buddy. Game four, buddy. Suits on deck. What could go wrong?. Shoresy? Give your balls a tug. Shoresy! Titfuckers. We heard what you said about us, you sack of shit. Never let a woman do a man's job, huh? Watch this, we're just taking a break from cooking and cleaning to win backtobacktoback 'ships, asshole. I'll make you a sandwich afterwards, though, I'll shove it up your ass for you, too. You two are the silliest twats I've ever met in my whole fuckin' life. I didn't say any of that shit, you dumb broads. But I did say your breath could stop a Mack Truck, BettyAnne, I'll tell that to anyone who will listen. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, BettyAnne, your breath is an existential crisis, made me question my whole fuckin' life. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, MaryAnne, you got legs on you like redwoods, you could boxjump a bungalow. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, Reilly, your mum groped me two Halloweens ago, shut the fuck up or I'll take it to Twitter. Fuck you, Shoresy. You're a horrible fuckin' ref. Fuck you, Jonesy, take a look at me, I'm not even a ref, I'm a fuckin' linesman, but you can referee on my nuts, you piece of shit. Fuck you, Shoresy! I'd still smash you both if I was bored, but Reilly and Jonesy's mums get too jealous. Make yourselves useful, grab me a bag of dill picklers. Good luck, you fuckin' losers. Let's stick it to that fuck. Literally and figuratively. Who the fuck skates like that? Stewart's recovery has been. Remarkable. He is almost. Unrecognizable. Are you ready? Ready! Calm down, Roald. Stewart! Fuck the wave, pull your finger out of your ass. I remember when you could smoke in here. Yeah, we're gonna smoke youse in here, bud. Came here to do two things, launch this broom on the ice and drink, and the gal at the bar just told me I'm cut off. Your gals look slower than my tractor, of course, mine's got a HEMI in her. Your gals are having a tougher time finding the puck than NHL on Fox circa 1996. I've seen more hustle in chess. Still no heaters in here, eh? I remember Letterkenny mounting the 50. Let's go, Shamrockettes!. Let's go, Shamrockettes!. Let's go, Shamrockettes. Pass to me! Okay, ladies. Women.. Hurry up and score a fuckin' goal already, I'm getting the bedtime sillies. Fuck off, Shoresy, give us our timeout. Fuck you, Reilly, tell your mum to give me a timeout. The last time I tried that, she threatened to take a header on me into an empty pool at the Quality Suites. Fuck you, Shoresy, leave us alone. Fuck you, Jonesy, tell your mum to leave me alone, she's been laying in my fuckin' water bed since Labor Day. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you all, your lives are so sad, I get a charity tax break just for hanging out with you. Nice sweep, no sweep, give your balls a tug. Enough fuckin' around. Let's do this.  Shamrockettes! We did it, buddy. Can't believe it, buddy. We won a fuckin' 'ship. We bought that boat. Hmm. Yeah, it's Mum. Mine too. Probably wanna say congratulations. We were discussing headlines from the city newspaper the other day. Damn shame about MoDeans burning down. Do you know what? It's really something how we keep losing those locations to drink at. The Ukrainian Center is a healthy consolation, though. Well, everybody knows the cheapest beers are at the Ukrainian Center. With the Legion being a close second. When's Gail getting back from her South American singles resort? When she's had her fill, I suppose. Delicious pun. Thank you, Wayne. Thank you, Bonnie. Now, was that your tummy grumbling? Or was that you proper?. That'd be me proper. A little grumble in the jungle over there. Little grumble in the Bronx. A little royal grumble. It was a grumble proper. Now, I'm a devout pupil of Social Justice Warriors, Professor Tricia. The devoutest. But dare I say things in the city is getting wee bit out of hands. What's the frequency, Kenneth? Well, the story I just read here is quite the incredible chain of events. You know, there's so many causes now. They're just tripping right over each other. Well, it's better than driving into each other. That was a bit dark, Dary. What's the scoop, Dan? Here's the scoop. Bunch of gals said that they were gonna stop tweetings for a day out of protest for sexual abuses towards womens. And they encouraged mens to stops tweetings in supports of the womens. So, what's the problem? Oh, I wasn't finished. Well, what happened next?. I'll tells you what happens next. Some black gals joined in on the protest, but they got mad at the white girls protesting, because womens of colors didn't receive the same supports on similar issues. I think I see where you're going with this. Well, did something happen even after that?. Something did happen after that. One of the white gals asking for supports got supports from one guy, but she told him he could fuck right off because apparently he used to call gals broads back in high schools. But they are tweeting about not tweeting. Do I have that right? I got a feeling something even happened after that. Yeah, me too, Dary. Me too. I got that same feeling. Well, here's what happened even after that. The President of Iceland sends out a happy birthday tweet to his daughter, Alfheiour. And now all the gals saying that you shouldn't be tweetings turns hims into public enemy number one. And it's on Twitter they're doing that? And to the President of Iceland, they're doing that? Icelanders are the most lovable fucking people on planet Earth. One more thing even happens, so help me God. So help me God. Something else did happen after that, because it turns out the President of Iceland's daughter, Alfheiour, has got herself a case of the Down syndromes. So here comes the Special Olympics advocates, and they're in a real bad way. As they should be. If you wanna go at Iceland, you better have your fucking facts right. Well, here's the kicker, turns out the President of Iceland's daughter, Alfheiour, is also a refugee from wartorn Somalia what he's adopted. So that increases the tension between the womens of colors not tweeting and the white gals not tweeting. To top it all off, here comes World Vision, and they're coming in a'swinging. Fuck every duck. What next? Oh, here's what happened after that. Remember that first guy that they told to fucks right off 'cause he used to call gals broads back in high school? Turns out he's paralyzed from the waist down. So here comes the war amps saying, You better back the fuck off our guy. Enough's enough. I can't handle anymore. Well, there's no way there's more. There's no goddamn way. Wait. There is more. Turns out the President of Icelands is paralyzed from the necks down, so now everybody's back on Iceland's sides again. Oh, right where they should've been the whole fucking time. Now, it's from the neck down that he's paralyzed, you say? So, how does he even make a tweet? And they're all doing this on Twitter? Where else but Twitter would this be happenings? On the day they're not exposed to be tweeting? On the very same day they're not exposed to be tweeting. Jesus!.  Look what's happening in local news!. What? Stay tuned to find out. Well, the Letterkenny Chiefs is changing their names and logos. That sounds about right. Probably for the best. They had a good run. The only constant in life is change, as they say. The only constant in life is change? It's a wee bit to wrap your head around there. Well, the only constant around here is everything stays the sames. Anywho. According to the writers of the Letterkenny Banner, the whole world's going to hells in a hand baskets. Sounds about right. Probably for the best. We had a good run. As long as we're going in a hand basket. As opposed to what kind of basket? Well, there's a bazillion different kinds of baskets. Hand and waste paper. What else? Okay, so maybe there's not a bazillion different kinds, but. Yeah, it's definitely not a bazillion different kinds. Yeah, that's what I just said, There's not a bazillion different kinds of baskets. Well, don't come in here saying bazillion unless you mean a bazillion. Okay. I was just for emphasis. I was saying, Bazillion different kinds of baskets. Go ahead and name five kinds of baskets besides hands and waste paper. Okay. Floor basket, hanging basket, wall basket, bike basket, basketball basket. All right. I withdraw. Bamboo bakset, britan bakset, liquor bakset. Bakset? Yes, that's one of two words that Dary can't say right. What's the other one, Dary? Brefekst. Yeah, Dary can't say the word breakfast either. You wanna try, bud? Brefekst. Bakset. Attaboy. So, what are they changing the name to? According to this, they're letting the publics decides with an onlines polls. Ooh, boy. Not a good idea. Is there a worse idea? Currently, the Letterkenny Rough Riders is leading by a hair. Is that your tummy grumbling? Or is that you proper? No, that'd be me proper. What's the rumpus, grumpus? Don't you think that there's already too many Rough Riders in the area as it is? You got the Redford Rough Riders. And a one. You got the Welno Rough Riders. And a two. And don't forget the Greater Maddawascow Rough Riders. And a three. And that's just off the tippy tops of our heads. Does get a bit confusing during playoffs. People like to root for a Rough Rider. Yeah, but if we're all going to be Rough Riders, why even have teams? Why not just be a big bunch of Rough Riders? Why don't you just name the whole league the Rough Riders? Why even stop there? Why don't we just go ahead and name the whole human race Rough Riders? Like, you see what I'm saying. Yeah. Today, we're all Rough Riders. What exactly is a Rough Rider? I don't know. All's I'm saying is that there's too many of them. Don't you see?. So, what else is in the running?. Ah, second place is the Letterkenny Muff Riders. Yeah, I can get behind Muff Riders. Hmm. What else? Third place goes to the Letterkenny Foot Fuckers. Shouldn't that be in first place, on account that it has foot in the title, and it's a soccer team? What else? Well, fourth place is a tie between the Big Nickelbacks and the 69ers. Both good choices. I don't know who to root for. People likes to root for a 69er. I don't have a problem. I don't have. I don't have a problem. I don't have a problem. Where is it? It's right here. First, the meth. I think you do have a problem. I don't have a problem! You've never acted like this before the. This is all because of the. I've never seen it get its claws in so deep. Give me the dark web. Stewart! I need the dark web. You're killing him! It is killing you! Give me the dark web. Take the dark web. The dark web is yours. Okay, so you keep the meth over there, right? We do. Let me show you. I'm in. Letterkenny, the hard right is inside of you. Fuck! These stooges again. I don't see a video request from them. How am I hearing their voice? Must be some hightech dark web shit. Stu? Stu! Appreciate the Stooges reference. Everyone knows Curly was the original skinhead. Plus Ron Asheton from Iggy and the Stooges had a real Third Reich obsession. Good Christ! It smells like somebody's been smoking gate waves in here. The Chiefs are changing their name. Who? Your beloved junior soccer team. Who? Ah! Nobody cares about anything anymore. What about the history? The tradition? What's a junior soccer team? Some people still care, all right? You best believe. And we are recruiting. So, gentlemen, are you ready to join the hard right? Politics? We're anarchists. Yeah. Who cares if the soccer team changes its name? The hard right, that's who. Chiefs is a strong name. I remember a time when being called a chief was a good thing. People like to root for a chief. This used to be the heartland. Now, it is just the other heartland of farleft liberal cucks. Did somebody get their feelings hurt? Did somebody sign a petition? Uh, news flash, you're all caving to PC culture. You're just a bunch of farleft liberal fucking pinko snowflakes. Oh, we've been called worse. But might as well just change the name to Letterkenny Cucks. Regional champs of Cuckistan! Okay. This is what the failed patriarchy looks like. I'm so sick of you beta male SJWs. We're not SJWs. I actually identify as a wood nymph. Super weird. Be gone. Oh, we'll be gone. Just as soon as you betas show us where the alphas are. I'll see myself out. I assume all of you are following suit. He talks more than I do. That was weird. Ah, yes! Now we're talking. The alphas. Real men. No matriarchy in sight. Who the fuck are you? I'm Hard Right Jay, and I represent the Hard Right, a group with farright ideologies that rejects mainstream conservatism and endeavors to promote white nationalism. Oh, white nationalism? Good thing Gail, the owner of the old bars ain't here. Oh, small town bar owner, what is she, like a good sixthgeneration Scottish woman? No. What are you's getting on about over there? Did you dinks bring these dudes here? What's the first meal of the day, Daryl? Your mom. Attaboy. Breakfast! Ah, that's it, right. Jesus Christ. Yeah, yeah. Run away like true socialistas. At least your actions are consistent with your failed ideologies. You edgelords are a walking horde of participation trophies. Go back to giving out hand jobs for free. We're not socialistas. I'm still with her. We're anarchists. And our hand jobs aren't free. So. Forg. Forgive. Forgive them. They don't see the big picture. Yet. What's the big picture? You wanna see how deep this rabbit hole really goes? Or are you guys globalists? What's that? Ah! I'll admit, I was anticipating the low energy, country cuck road show, but you're curious. Color me glad. It's time to wake up. It's time for you to spit out all of the toxic sludge you've been spoon fed by the Ian Hanomansings and the Gloria Macarenkos of the world. We are a movement. Bowel movement by the looks of it. Ah, hachimachi, I like your fire. We could use more women in the movement. We have next to none, for reasons we can't quite decode. Pitter patter. Yes, pitter patter. All lives matter. News flash, the out of control PC police are forcing your beloved Letterkenny Chiefs to change their name. Yeah, we caught that. Yeah, well, we're here to protest that. Our legions of brothers will be joining me at John Letterkenny Field later. And we want you, the salt of the earth alphas, the stewards of traditional morals, traditional values, the silent majority, to join us. The fight against poor, uneducated libtards requires nothing short of a massacre. Now you're a bit fucking dramatic, eh? Why is keeping the name of the Chiefs important to you?. It isn't. Oh, oh, it's not. It isn't? Well, not really, in the long run. Nor the short run, really. Yeah, no need to get your jimmies all out of joint. Well, but you. You understand why it's important to fight the left? Yes? I didn't know it was necessary, much less important. The point is the government is trying to keep you and your humble agricultural livelihoods thoroughly cucked. It's time to wake up and smell the chem trails. It's time to stand up for your God given right to have kickass names for all your favorite teams, and fuck anybody whose feelings get hurt along the way. Oh, is that what time it is? Oh, you think I don't have feelings? You think my feelings don't get hurt? My grandfather has a pacemaker, right? Every time I watch the Indiana Pacers play basketball, it makes me think of Papi. And his irregular heartbeat. And it fucks me up, big time. You see me complaining to the Indiana Pacers or anyone in the NBA? Mmm, suck it up, buttercup. So? So what? So join us. Tell you what. I'll fight you for it. You and me. Sorry, what? What I'm saying is, I'll fight you. And if you win I'll come to the field with you. But if you lose, we're not asking for anything in return. Ah, you SJWs are a lost cause. I'm going to troll! Letterkenny Chiefs! Letterkenny Chiefs! We can do this, buddy. We can establish order, buddy. I know we can. HARD RIGHT. Of course you can. Ah. Hockey, eh? Fastest sport on Earth. And the whitest too, arguably, so bonus points there. Okay, the Catholic school games are on the other rink. Uh, we just, uh, thought you strapping alphas might want to know that the globalists are trying to turn your small town into a hive of postcastrati extremism. What the fuck's castrati? Uh, it's a pasta, bro. Uh, it's pronounced pahsta, bro. Is it? Today, it's the Letterkenny Chiefs. Tomorrow, it'll be your beloved Shamrocks. Well, you know, the Chiefs is kinda not PC though, buddy. We try to keep it, like, kind of in touch there. What if they decide to get butt hurt over the Letterkenny Shamrocks name next and force you to change it just because they don't know how to control their. Their fragile beta male emotions? What then, huh? You don't see a bunch of Irish people protesting here, do you? No, you don't. They're not,. Argh, please change your name! None of that's happening. You wanna know why? Because Irish people don't fucking complain about anything, all right? Irish people know how to take it like a champ, okay? You take their potatoes away, they don't say a fucking thing. It's pronounced potahto. Is it? It's called manning up, gentlemen. You might want to look into it. What do you think, buddy? I think this guy's a goof, buddy. Cool, buddy. Yeah, but. On that note, I'm not really a fan of the Shamrocks name. Really? Yeah. Me too, buddy. I mean, if we're talking about some kind of negative stereotype attached to that name, you know? Right? It's like, just because my name is Reilly, that doesn't necessarily mean that I'm a drunken leprechaun. Maybe we should change the name, buddy. What's this about a name change? If anybody should change their names, it should be us. What the hell's a Shamrockette anyway? A leaf with tits? Oh, this isn't your matriarch, is it? You can't just add ette to the end of the men's team and expect women to like it. We should change our names to something fierce and feminine and powerful. Like the Screaming Banshees. That's good, MaryAnne. Impressive creativity. Couple of hens clucking away. Especially for a girl who had to start kindergarten two years late because she couldn't grasp coloring. I've plenty of good ideas, BettyAnne. Like convincing your dad to get a vasectomy so I wouldn't have to worry about another you coming into the world while I fucked him. We were just starting to get them under control. You're screwing it up, bro. You're getting them all fired up again. Bringing family into it now, MaryAnne? I would never stoop so low, especially with the recent passing of your mother, who told me before she died that my dad is your dad too. You're fucking up our progress, man. Just get out of here. It's only gonna get worse too. Thanks a lot. Ah, these Tumblrinas have lost the plot anyway. Letterkenny Chiefs! Letterkenny Chiefs! Where the fuck is everybody? This is supposed to be a protest. We need people to protest and piss off and agitate. Ay, ay, ay. Whose idea was this stupid name change anyway?. Ours. S'up, Nazis? Nazi? Hilarious. Ain't nothing funny about this, honky. No, but Nazi, really? Nazi? Would a Nazi ride a Yamaha scooter? A pansy Nazi? Sure. Would a Nazi have a Jew for a lawyer? Could you refer me, asshole? 'Cause I'm gonna need one in a minute. Would a Nazi own a gameworn Tim Duncan jersey? You sniff that shit before bed at night, cupcake? Would a Nazi's favorite snacks include ramen, pad thai, or pho? It's pronounced phoe, Phoe, dummy. Oh. All right, would a Nazi get turned on by interracial gang bang porn? Who fucking doesn't? All right, I think we all need to chill out here. We're getting ahead of ourselves. We are an inclusive movement. I think you should join us. Is that what we should do? Yes. Think about it, Sacagawea. We share a lot. We have a lot in common. We both pride ourselves on traditional values, traditional morals. We share a very antiimmigration stance. You know, if you think about it, we actually share a lot of common ground. Historically, sharing ground hasn't been your strong suit. If you guys are here, then who's jerking off in your mom's basement? Somewhere there's a men's rights meeting missing their door greeters. Yeah, look. I get it. You're frustrated. It must be really exhausting never paying taxes your whole lives. All right. Enough chinwagging. Another hen cluck, cluck, clucking away. Hey, no one had a problem with this. No one had a problem until you's came to town. That's it. The Hard Right, coming to a town near you. Yeah, we didn't come here to counterprotest. Ain't nothing peaceful gonna happen today. Hey, we don't practice violence. We do. We don't practice violence. But we are prepared for it. All right. Let's go then. Let's do this. You and what army? That one. Golden pastures from here. It's all I see. Nary a chem trail in the sky. Possibility of a gentle Nor'Wester. Oh, three to five clicks by the look of her. Well, times to check in on the Letterkenny Banner. What's the latest? Was that your tummy grumbling or was that you proper? That was my tummy. Good enough. Well, it looks like they canceled the online polls to pick the new team name. Oh, is that what they did? Yeah, it seems like the Muff Riders was runnings away with it. Foot Fuckers made more sense by far. I'm disappointed. What are they going with instead? Rough Riders. Of course they are. Playoffs start next week. Who they playing? Runforough Rough Riders. That's gonna be a really good game. Must be hard kicking the ball in the snow. My money's on the Rough Riders. You're crazy. I got the Rough Riders by a mile. Care to make it interesting?. I'll put ten bucks on the Rough Riders. Make it twenty. I'll take that. I'm in too. See, Wayne, people love to cheer for a rough rider. The world's going to hell in a hand basket, big brother. In a what, Dary? Brefekst bakset. Attaboy.  Hats off to Tanis, boys. It's certainly a great day for Thunder Bay. Yeah, Tanis has outdones herself. She sure did. Say, where is Tanis? Well, Tanis the Tough gal. Homewrecker. Rocket. Sniper. Alpha female. Temptress. A bit rough around the edges. Tried to lure you in to the barn for a. Round of the bases. Homewrecking. Slam. Crush. Roll in the hay. Lay in the biblical sense. Toe curl. And the truth is you kinda wanted to. Pet heavily. Wreck your home? Rack up a kill. Score a take down. Have the best sex of your life. Fondle? Become one. But you didn't. Because that's not what a. Good 'ol boy. Real man. Straight shooter. Team player Seriously? Godfearing gentleman. Stand up guy. Does. On the contrary, a. Good 'ol boy. Real man. Straight shooter. Team player. Pussy. Godfearing gentleman. Standsup guy. Doesn't cheat. So while you walked towards the barn for what one would assume was a. Poke. Terrible fucking idea. Easy kill. Quick mash. Whatever you are into, baby. Lustful encounter. A lot of character is undertaken. You didn't. You got in the truck, drove over to Rosie's and. Now, Rosie is a. Real pretty gal. So fucking cute. Ten. Damn. Book reader. Goddess. Fine woman. You can't be with one woman and have feelings for another. You are of the opinion that cheaters are. In the wrong. Like, 95% in the wrong. Bad? Or. Seduced. Fair and square. Antagonized. Likely a good persons who just mades a mistake. And you shouldn't very well go down that road. So. Here's the thing. Okay, you go. No, you go. Okay, I'll go. I'm gonna move to the city. You are gonna move to the city? I'm gonna move to the city. What city? Vancouver. Well, you won't get many random snowy summer nights like this in Vancouver. Nope. So what's in Vancouver? Pit bull rescue. I'm tired of reading about it every day. I wanna help. You're a great fucking gal, Rosie. You're a great fucking dude, Wayne. When will I see you? When you see me. Good enough. And that's what a get out of jail free card looks like. Boy, howdy. Well, I should say. Sick buddy. Sick, bro. Can we bang now? Wondrous! I likes Monopoly. So, as for Tanis. Get after it. Sure. Killzone? Poundtown? We should be banging right now. Tanis. You could do much worse, good buddy. You and Tanis are gonna give her the old college try. Good enough. Good enough. Good enough. Good enough. Good enough. Good enough. Good stuff. Finally, a nonsummer weddings. I'm smilings. Well, it seems a little bit unfair that at summer weddings gals get to wear a nice, breezy summer dress and then we're stuck being sweaty and sticky in some threepiece wool suit. I guess it can gets quites pongies down there. Yeah, it can get a bit moist. No. Who do you think is gonna moist the Stanley Cup, this year, Katy? I'm thinking Calgary. I swear to fucking Christ Oh, did you never see Moist Story? Or Moist Story 2, starring Tim Allen and Tom Hanks? Are you out of your fucking mind? I will fight you. We don't fight at weddings. So, Dary, are you gonna be wearing your dad's suit? Do falling timbers make tambers? Who the fuck are you? Yes, Katy. I got it for a grade 13 semiformal from the Letterkenny Op shop. Loves the Op shops. I'll take the Sally Ann. You know what? That suit is so dad the last time you wore it, it told me the Dire Straits were the greatest band of all time. That suit is so dad it ate all the lunch meat on the way home from the grocery store. The suit is so dad it owns a VHS copy of The Hunt for Red October. So, Dan, are you gonna cold rock a kilt? Like my Grandpas and his grandpas before him. A little class, a little sass and a lot of ass all in one tartans garments. Wayne, I assume you'll be wearing one of only two suits that you own. Two will do you. One for weddings and one for funerals. A good suit lasts you the rest of your life if you take care of it. What would you wear for a court appearance? I've never been arrested. What would you wear to a job interviews? I've only ever had one job. What would you wear to a bar mitzvah? Not Jewish. Bat mitzvahs? Still not Jewish. Graham's from the city. So there's gonna be a lot of citiots at this thing. I fucking hate citiots. They're always going on about how we're saying, fucking mud in our fucking hammies. Fucking riding our sleds down to a fucking pit party, bud. Giving her tits. I was climbing the ladder up the hay mound behind your brother and ew! Ripped a fart that sounded like a creaky door opening inside a hot air balloon, but. We do not fight at weddings. No, but we can get laid if we're keen to. Sexy just wafts around at weddings. Plenty of opportunities for people looking to do some yessing. A little bit of wedding spreading. A little bit of matrimonies and hide the balonies. Oh, sure, maybe some exchanging of rings and rubbing of things. Clear eyes. Full Windsors. Can't lose. Clean up well, Cowboy. Well, a good suit will last the rest of your life if you take care of it. And me? Well, I wouldn't kick you out of bed for eating fucking crackers, Tanis. Top shelf ceremony, boys. Short, sweet and not too much God. I'm told God doesn't have much time for gays these days, so. Par for the course, I guess. Real prouds of Dax and Ronsford jumps in the brooms like that. Good guys. Good grooms. I wonder what that must be like. What? Getting hitched? No, being into dudes. I've got so many questions. Yeah, and I wanna hear exactly zero of them. It's like, what if you are attracted to somebody with the same name as you? Is it like, How fun? Or is it fucking weird? It'd be fucking weird. Quite likely. That's never happened to me. Guess the closest I ever came to it was almost doing it with a gal named Sheryl. Yeah, I suppose it'd kindsa be like the time I almost hooked up with a gal who had the same names as my Grandmas. That would be fucking offputting. It was. It was distracting at inappropriate times. With. Ruth. I wish there was a goddamn way I could do it with a Katy. Ew! Or a Kate or a Caitlin. I guess Katherine would even be walking the line. There's no way I could do it with a Wayne. Ew! Unless it was Gretzky or Rostad. Or Newton. I'd bow to the great ones. I'd bend right over. I'd like Gretzky in my office behind the net. I'd be a jar of curry in a fucking hurry just feeding him all night long. I promised Mess I wouldn't do this. I just promised to mess. I'd let Gretzk leave my ass seriously McSorely I'd let that lady Bing lady bang me. That's 69 with 99 into overtime. I'd just straight up let him 99 me. Howdy who. Ah, what's a 99? It's just fucking while spooning. All right, boys. Show me what you can do with a cock. Hail!. Heyho. Oh, good day, lads. Did you ride your fucking sleds here? Oh, are you fucking matting her? Is she a charity ride, like, Holy Fuck? Just about clear putting it in the fucking rhubarb. Yous just gonna stand there rubbing your peckers or what? Oh, she's fucking tits, eh? D'you give her beans, bud? D'you give her boots, bud? Do you give her fucking torque?. Do you wanna get fucking smoke? Or are you taking her easy? If she's easy, take her twice, bud. We'll call you toonie two times. Let's do her manure. Isn't this the part where you. We don't fight at weddings. Those citiots can fucking tie their dicks in a knot. They can go piss up a rope. Gretzky, Rostad and Newton for Katy, eh? I'm surprised Lil Wayne didn't make the cut. What? Great dress, Bonnie. Thanks. Op Shop. You look like the girl who punched my V ticket. What's your nationality? You ever seen the back seat of a BMW X3? You should be honored. My buddy here only fucks tens. Only tens. Right in the X. Seriously, come outside. I'll show you the 3. It's actually the exact same as the 5. X5. BMW. Just way better on gas. Living the Beem. Stewart, I know you are the world's foremost fire selector, but this is a wedding and I promised the grooms we'd play songs like Brown Eyed Girl and Shout and Lean on Me, Ain't No Mountain High Enough and Mambo No. 5 Yous guys got the Chicken Dance ready to play yet? I fucking love that song, I'll tell you. I put it on in the barn for the cluckers when them peckerfaced bastards ain't dropping eggs, I just love it. Are you being facetious? Huh? Can your vestigial minds even comprehend the derogatory nature of your requests? Or maybe you could compromise? Do something cool like beat juggle the Chicken Dance? Here, take. Enough! Deejaying is an art form. A medium in which the most prolific audio auteurs of our time can speak through. A deep connection of the soul of yourself and the gyrating asses of the great unwashed who eagerly thirst for your deafening compositions. I like gyrating asses but I'm pretty sure it ain't art there, bud. Yeah, wouldn't you have to have written the songs yourself for it to be art? I'm sorry, composed? I think the word is produced. Right, or at least didn't download off the Internet so you could profit off them. Yeah, you are more like an art dealer than an artiste. Or like an art gallery curator. Selling stolen paintings. That you printed off the Internet. Whoa! If you do not fall back, and fasten that lip. Your other, thinner lip. I'll turn this elegant, soigne ceremony of the coming together of two bonded souls into a straight up blood rain. Hey! Over here. Chicken Dance. Get it? Just wanna go Good game you fucking beauties. Way to tape your sticks together, boys. You two make a hot pairing. Five minute major and a lifetime misconduct for butt ending. You boys enjoying yourselves? Acting single. Seeing double. Drinking triples. Daxy, I gotta say, solid work on the big city slam prospects. Solid big city slam scouting, Daxy. Boys, a little, uh, players only here. You are not pulling tonight. Yes, we are. These are modern city gals. None of them have any interest in hockey player types. Boys, big muscles haven't been popular with the ladies since Jersey Shore. The only way to get any attention from a cosmopolitan, college gal type is to get in touch with your inner twink. You need to be less power forward and more power bottom. We'll get our wedding stylist to help them out. So we need to. Spruce up our look? No. You gotta bruce up your look. So Professor Tricia says that Letterkenny has developed into quite the homosexual scene and we can rightly expects a Pride parades next springs. Never been to a Pride parade. What's it like? It's like a Santa Claus parade. Except instead of handing out candy, they hand out condoms. I should probably start thinking about a name right now. Great Day for gay. A Hard Gay's Night. Eyes Pride Shut. Pride Green Tomatoes. Pride of Chucky. Independence Gay. Ferris Bueller Gets Off. Star Wars Rogue One. The Princess Pride. Pride of Frankenstein. Pride and Go Seeks. Carlito's Gay. Night of the Giving Head. Lay Anything. Final Mantasy. Third Cock from the Sun. How fella Got His Groove Pack. The Gay the Earth Stood Still. Eat, Gay, Love. Dr. Strangelove or how I learned to stop wearing, Love the Bum. Bonnie and Pride. Oh, Bonnie McMurray. You boys tried the catering yet? I am chomping at the bit to get one of those cupcakes. Nots to be impolite, Dary but it's actually champing at the bits. Oh, you got those pits ready for your fucking ponies? How many ponies you got under your hood? You got a frigging hemmy under there? How many CCs is your sled? Do you fucking pin her when you get pickled there, bud? Oh, I really fucking gave it to her last night. Working hard or hardly working? What happened to the part where. We don't fight at weddings. I gotta piss. I'll come with you. Yeah, same. Okay, let's go. My cock he lives now. Redux. What's up, ladies? What is your nationality? Grow up around here? Have any tattoos? I got a Celtic symbol on my calf. I got a Nike swoosh right above my heart. I got you a drink. I swear it's not a roofie. Yes, it is. Of course, it is. Hey, that's a real nice dress. Look a lot nicer on my hotel room floor. You ever seen the front seat of a Honda del Sol? I'll have a roll in your hay any day. We don't fight at weddings. I got a Harman Kardon system in the 3. X3. BM motherfucking W, baby. It's actually way better than Bose. Dickskin? Dickens. Fellas, a list of my requests. To be played back two, back two, three, four, well I have five songs. No requests. How dare thou come into my private roost of penetrating beats with an audacious act of social and musical treason. Every single one of these is a Brooks and Dunn song. Starting with the Boot Scootin' Boogie. I didn't realize they had other songs. Of all the boogies, the Boot Scootin' is the last one I would and will ever torture myself or others with. I'll give you a Boot Scootin'. What about Blame It on the Boogie by the Jackson 5? Boogie, Oogie, Oogie, A taste of honey. Boot Scootin'. Boogie Wonderland, by Earth Wind & Fire Elton John's Street Boogie. This wedding needs a boogie and it's gonna be Boot Scootin'. Born to Boogie, T Rex? Boogie Woogie Wu, Insane Clown Posse. Zip Gun Boogie, T Rex again. Take the damn boogie and make it a Boot Scootin'. I'm Your Boogie Man, KC and the Sunshine band. I'm Your Boogieman, White Zombie. I hoped it wouldn't come to blows over a boogie. But I'll damn well go to blows. For the Boot Scootin' Boogie. Not happening, Dickskin. Dickens! I got it. I got it. I got the Chicken Dance. Went home and got it out of the cassette player in the tractor. You play it now or later. Either way, you'll play it. Or you'll die. What's with the super sad glassware, boys? What's with your hair? Oh, just got some big city prospects. Don't wanna risk putting a big goose egg up on the board. Don't wanna fan on a yonny cage, buddy. So, we bruced up our looks. What does that mean? Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it, yeah. How's that going for ya? Uh, good. We got bites. Yeah. Well, we got like, a. A bite. They were 50 though. I took down an older lady once. It was kinda fun. Kinda weird. Why? Well, after she made a pizza. Sick, buddy. She ordered a pizza. No, made a pizza. From scratch, buddy. I had to sit and talk while she made a pizza. You two look like dandies. You look like pansies. You know, the landscape might be changing but manly men never go out of style. Hello, ladies. Yeuch, I can't drink this shit anymore. What am I a ballerina trying to get skinny? I'm gonna get some rye, babe. Cheers. Katy got hit on by a top hat guy. A top hat. A guy in a top hat. I'd rather take down a city than a guy in a top hat. Oh, I don't know, Ms. Katys. Some men looks quite statelys in a top hat. Scrooge McDuck comes to mind. Mr. Peanut. Slash. The guy from T Rex. Abe Lincoln. Uncle Pennybags from Monopoly. Willy Wonka's. The Cat in the Hat. Guy from T Rex again. Oh, hey there, buds. Is she a manual? Or are you driving a bitch stick? You like bud lite? You like butt holes around here. Oh, did you get your pecker stuck in a bottle of brew? Where's your sweety bud? Did she leave you to your John and your John Deere? Where's your John queer, bud? I was brought up on Looney Tunes and only dancing when nobody's around. Learned the heck out of it that way, Dan. I am fucking irritated. We don't fight at weddings. Right. We don't fight at weddings. Ten four? Over and out. Hello, ladies. Ladies. Can we interest you in a shot of sourpuss? Perhaps a half glass of white zinfandel? Have you looked at any interesting furniture lately? I admire his eye for interior design. What are you two going on about? You are really missing the mark. You know, metrosexuality went out of style with the Von Dutch and Chingy. We are into men. Classic men, athletic types. You don't look like you can fix my car. You don't look like you can fix a sliding screen door. What? Wha. What? We're . We're hockey players. We're the snipe, celly boys. Dirty fucking dangles boys. What are you guys going on about now? Now you are just being posers. It's pretty pathetic. Even if you are hockey players, we are not puck bunnies. Or lacrossetitutes. I don't even drink. I drink beer. Where are you guys staying tonight? There's only motel in this shit hole, so that one. I've never ridden in a BMW X3 before. What about a BMW X3 with a luxury leather package? She just said she'd never ridden in one, idiot. Take me home. Ladies and gentlemen. The song for the first dance. Chosen by. The grooms. I can't wait to take sauce from you and slot from now until the horn blows at the end of quadruple overtime. Playoff rules, nice. There was always an open bet. I'll take the tender tonight. A six man, you know what I am talking about. As long as you can bury. Oh, we will find a hole. You can't slip one past me. Let's steer this back.  Your friend Dary said he can beat up your friend Dan the other day. You're dreaming, bud. Am not. Are, too. You're Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, bud. All I'm saying is, if it came down to it and I hope it wouldn't. Well, see you're soft on it already, Dary. I could beat Dan in a fight. You're mixing a Hardy, bud. Am not. Are, too. You're down there mixing a Tom Hardy. Oh, I would smash that dude like a Terry's Chocolate Orange Same. How's your beers?. I'll have a beer. Must be nice, you can pick up some extra shifts here while Gail's down at her South American Single's Resort, huh, Bonnie? You wanna know what? If two of my bars burnt down I'd be fucking off, too. I'm envious of that old goat. It's light lifting. This place could run off honor system if it had to. Okay, Katy and Bonnie, who do you think would win a fight, me or Dan? Dan. Why don't you two just arm wrestle and get to the bottom of it. No. Why not? Well, because arm wrestling is not a legitimate barometer for strength, and certainly not toughness. You're either born a good arm wrestler or you're not. Youse could leg wrestle. No. Why not? Well, because if they're on the floor rubbing their legs together, they've both lost. How are we gonna sort this out? Oh, youse could have to fight. No. Sure. See, you're a good friend, Dan. How is Dan a good friend in all of this? Well, Dan sees you're quite upset about this. He's willing to put his beer down, come over there and beat the shit out of you so that you're over it. Tyson, who would win in a fight between Dan and Dary? Dary. Yes. Why? Longer reach, quicker on his feet. Not above a nut shot or a hair pull. Joint Boy? Squirrelly Dan. Why? 'Cause he's Squirrelly. Who do youse think would win in a fight between you two?. Me. You?. Me. See, now there's a good friend. Fifteenfour and I'd hoped for more. Fifteentwo, that's where it's new. Zeros, which is also knowns as a 19's hand, 'cause a 19's hand is impossibles to get in the games of Cribbage.  Coolin' down out there, folks. Down to about 10 degReese's Peanut Butter Cups. Anywho. Based on length of past spelling bees, coupled with speller proficiency, this year's bee will be single knockout. Sudden death overtime begins right now. Could I use the toilet? I don't know. Can you? May I use the toilet? Yes, you may. Katy, the first word is yours. Shut up! Shut your fucking mouth! You think this is the PGA? You can just hoop and holler whenever you want? Baba fucking booey? We respect our athletes here, so sit down, shut up, and enjoy some fucking adult spelling. Katy, your word is Farceur. Farceur. Can I get a definition, please? A writer or actor of satire. Farceur. Hence, farce. Farceur. FARCEUR. Farceur. Correct. They should be able to clap if she gets one right, Squirrelly Dan. Yeah, like that's what we've done in the past. Yeah, but looks at what happens last years. Yeah, but she's used to getting cheered for, right? We don't want her to get inside of her own head if no one cheers for her. It's the last thing we fucking want. It's too risky, Dan. Okay, I'm sorry for my outburst earlier. I came at you with a lot of anger and that was unnecessary. You can cheer if someone gets a word right, but its starts and ends there. I don't wanna hear a fucking fart out of any of you if someone gets a word wrong. As sure as grandma's got gout, if I hear one fucking heckle, I will staple your tongue to your taint, so you can watch me kick your ass. Jimmy, why don'ts you repeat the last thing you said there?

Dickskin. We sure we got the right Master of Ceremonies for this thing here, okay? I think you need to get your earwax checked, Dickskin. Give 'em a fucking break, Jim. They've been spelling their goddamn hearts out up there. Call an intermission. There was no intermission slotted for today's bee. We'll press on. How many words gots to gets spelled before someone just keels over. Someone's gotta start asking the tough questions around here. I've seen this before, Jim. It's time we learned from it. In the words of arguably the greatest Canadian rock band of all time, The Tragically Hip, It's a good life if you don't weaken. Also in the words of Gordon Downie, legendary lead singer of The Tragically Hip, I can make you scared if you want me to.. Hey, okay. That's good then. Fifteen minute intermission, everyone. Sorry about that, Wayne. I'll get her hydrated. Youse get Reilly and Jonesy on Jim Dickins' radar. Some buttfuckery at play there. Jims. Now I know you noticed that Reilly and Jonesy's words are simpler than everyone else's, and quite suspiciously all hockeysrelated. Yep, there's a wee bit of buttfuckery at play here, Jim. This has been the system ever since Uncle Eddie won the very first Letterkenny Adult Spelling Bee. in the late '60s. We must honor it. Exactly. And aren't you guys the ones that are always saying you shouldn't fuck with tradition. It's fucking embarrassing. Jim, McMurray's screwing the system, here. You can't understand what he's saying. He's pulling the wool over your eyes, cowboy. Well, well, well. Ain't not hater quite like a spelling bee hater, now, is there? What's the matter, Tanis? You got some money riding on the bee? Money? There is to be no betting at the Letterkenny Adult Spelling Bee. Your dirty money is an insult to the integrity of the sport. Yeah, Tanis. All this time talking could be spent spelling. It's not called a Spelling Talk, it's called a Spelling Bee, and we're here to be spellers! Where's the bounty. We're dry. We need sustenance. You smoked like 20 onegram cannons. Like how are you even conscious right now? Fuck. You got this. Katy. This is getting out of hand, Stewart. Too much for you? What? Did you think this would be silent eeeasy?. Yes. Stay hydrated. There will be no more intermissions, and there better not be any degenerate gambling. Amidst allegations of contest rigging, there will be a new order for the spellers. I will be selecting names randomly from this hat moving forward. Fedora's a dumb fucking hat. It is, but I do believes that that's a dumb fucking trilbys. Joint Boy. The first word is yours. Fuck.

Bosky. Sounds a lot like brosky, buddy. How do you spell brosky? I don't know how to spell anything, buddy. Fucking idiots. Maybe we should just take the R out of brosky? I don't think there is an R in brosky. I'm going in on brosky, buddy. Yeah, good luck on brosky, buddy. Fuck, yeah. Brosky, uh. I mean, Bosky. BOSKI. Bosky. Incorrect. Fucking embarrassing!. McMurray, the next word is yours. McMurray, your word is Penalty. Penalty. Hey, that was supposed to be Jonesy and Reilly's word. Well, that's fucking embarrassing. Penalty, penalty. PENLY. Penalty. Incorrect. The correct spelling of Penalty is PENALTY. Exactly what I said. No, it isn't. Youse ever see that movie Dick Tracy The one with Warren Beatty? I would smash that dude like a neighbor's pumpkin on devil's night. Same. Well, Dick Tracy used a similar machine to slow down and decipher the speech of an appropriatelynamed character, Mumbles. What?. Let me show you. This is Mr. McMurray's answer at normal speed.  PENALTY. Penalty. See? Now this is his answer slowed down.  PENALDY. Witch! McMurray, you're eliminated. Please take a seat offstage. Penalty. Youse want to get hammered? Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached our final two contestants. Let's give them a round of applause. In the final round, if a speller misspells a word. his or her opponent will then have a chance to steal. Katy, the first word is yours. Katy, your word is Triskaidekaphobia. Triskaidekaphobia. Triskaidekaphobia. TRISKAID EKA PHOBIA. Triskaidekaphobia. I'm sorry, Katy, that's incorrect. No. No, Jim. that's how you spell Triskaidekaphobia. That's not what I'm reading on the card here, Katy, I'm sorry. Stewart, you now have a chance to steal. Settle down, people. Settle down. Triskaidekaphobia. TRISK ADEKAP HOBIA. Triskaidekaphobia. Correct. Stewart, you're backtoback champion of the Letterkenny Adult Spelling Bee. Wait! Katy, had it right. It was wrong on the monitor. Triskaidekaphobia is spelled. TRISKAI DEKAPHOBIA. Which is exactly what I said. No, it isn't.  TRISK ADE KA PHOBIA Silent I win. Champ! Yes! Yeah!. Why? Anyone wanna double me home, ladies? Everyone knows how to spell Triskaidekaphobia. It's the most common word used in spelling bees. I know that, but there is a reason that I spelled. Fucking idiot. Fucking idiots. Oh, fuck, buddy, it's Coach. Probably gonna ream us out. Fuck, what does he want, buddy?. Who could it be?. Give your balls a tug, you titfucker. You were sippin' suds with your buds the other day. Hey, Dary, real quick. Blank, lunch and dinner. Brehfekst. Oh, boy. Can I be honest with you guys for a sec? Oh, careful, Dary. I'd suggest everything you've said up until now has been a lie. And you've said lots of things. Like, when someone starts a sentence with Don't take this the wrong way. Guess what? I already did. Yeah, the same thing if people start a sentence by saying, You're gonna hate me for saying this. Guess what? I already do. Or, when people start a sentence by saying, You're not gonna wanna hear this. Guess what? I already don't. No, it's just an observation. Well I'm curious as to know why you thought it required a preface. Well, because I'm aware of how it might sound. Quit beatin' around the bush, Dary. Yeah, Dary, I don't remember you been such an aroundthebush beater. Oh, fine, now I'm not even gonna say it. Say it. The only thing worse than saying, You're not gonna wanna hear this, is when someone says they have something to say, and they don't say it. You're digging your heels in like a 12yearold girl. When in doubt, spit's it out. Okay, fine, I'm gonna say it. Okay, here goes. You know microbrewing? Like, craft beer? Yeah. I always thought it was craft beard, on account of the guys who make it always have beards. So, it was all that for just this then, eh? Thank you for inviting us into the circle of trust, Dary. I believe the preferred term is, lumbersexuals. Well, craft beard makes a pocketload more sense. You know, craft beards doesn't really bother me. But it's the clever wordplay that goes into the naming of it that I finds hard to swallow. Like, So hoppy together, or Barley breathing. Now, why don't you just call them what it is? It's fuckin' beer. Beer and headlights. Yeah. I'll contribute. Ale by comparison. Stout and about. Sounds actually pretty good, Stout and about. Stout and about's not bad at all, actually. I'd drink some stout and about. I'm surprised we're not drinking a stout and about right now. I think what you wanna do is you wanna put an animal in the name 'cause people love animals. Like, Cute Koala Cream, or Happy Hamster Honey. No, no. What you wanna do is you wanna put a berry in the name 'cause people love berries. Partridge Berry Pilsner, or Alderberry Ale. Pleasing to the ears and the mouth. No, Dary. Dary, no. No, Dan. Dan, no. No, Katy. Katy, no. What you're exposed to do, is put something cozy in the names 'cuz people like being cozy, right? Like toque or mittens. And then, if you really wanna double down on it, you put something outdoorsy in the name because people love being outdoors. Like, lake, or mountains. So what it's really gonna boil down to is Toque Lake Brew co, or Mountain Mittens Alpine Ale. Blanket Fire Light. There you go, Dary. The other ways to go is to use a clever, but ironical statement. Like, I'm bitters. See, I'd go suggestive. Like, Slipitin cider. Katy. What? Let's get this gal a fuckin' puppers. Dary, have a shot? I'd have a shot. Dan, have a shot? I'd have a shot. McMurray, have a shot? I'll have a shot. Tyson, have a shot? I'll have a shot. JB, have a shot? I'll have a shot. Fuck, boys. let's have a shot. G'day? Et JeanCarl. Et JeanPierre. Mes amis.

A JackandJill, always a thrill. Drinkanddance till you shit your pants. Love a good turnandstomp. Love a sipandspin. What's a sipandspin? Who the fuck are you? A sipandspin. Staganddoe. JacksandJills. Drinkanddance. Turnandstomp. Or a buckanddoe, is a prewedding party thrown by the best man and maid of honor to raise money for the bride and groom's big day. Oh, cool. Get the fuck out of here, dude. In Winnipeg, they call them socials. Can confirm. You know, Winnipeg has a very large Ukranian population. Not too many people know that. Hey, Jewish and Italian, too. Not too many people know that. Whose gulp and grind is it? Remember Anik? Oh. Well, that's why you gotta strike while the iron's hot, big shooter. Another French gal that got away. I can't catch a break. Who's drivin'? Oh, fuck, not me, I'm hammered. Dary, you hammered? Oh, I'm hammered. Dan, you hammered? Oh, I'm hammered. McMurray, hammered?. I'm hammered. Tyson, you hammered? I'm hammered. JB, you hammered? I'm hammered. Fuck, boys, we're hammered. And how's that for ya? Well, it's not too bad for me, but right about now it's not smart, really.

Right. Except, youse gotta realize that, in all likelihood, your French pals probably have some French pals who doesn't want us English dudes to go to their party in Quebec. Right? Left. Right. Quebec damn near left Canada. Separatism is alive and well in Quebec right now, mon freres. Well, they just had the referendum damn near yesterday. Mmm. If, by yesterday, you mean a quarter of centuries ago, then, yeah, I can back that. I said, It feels like. No, you didn't. Did, too. No, you didn't. Did too. Did not. See? The French is causing separation separatism right here, right now. Settle down, McMurray. Alls I'm sayin' is, if they're not happy to see me, then I ain't pretending to be happy to see them. You heard it here first. When a friend asks for help, you help him, and that's all there is to it. Dary, you'll have a scrap? I'd have a scrap. Dan, you have a scrap? I'd have a scrap.

MapQuest it? Or. Should we get a motel, and stay the night, or. McMurray. Katy. So you know? You hear that? Oh. That's the most aggressive twostep I think I ever heard. That's no twostep. Huh? It's showtime. You must forgive me for not washing my hands. We gotta go! Roger. I told him I couldn't marry him. Is that what you did? I told him I was not happy. Good enough. I told him I was in love with an Englishman. Good enough? I told him I was in love with you. That's good stuff. Do you like to dance? I fuckin' love to dance. Let's go. You're having a conversation about your pal's second cousin. The other day. Who, Jarret?. No, Garrets. He's a good guy. He took me to the movies in grade six, and he wouldn't hold my hand. A young man's hands can get sweaty in that sort of situation. Then put your arm around me, what's the problem? Anywho, Garrett's movings down to Los Angeles to try to be an actors. He's winning for the weather alone. Negative. It shouldn't be warm all the time. Four seasons helps keep a man regular. Like a bowl of brans in the mornin'. Huh. Garrett's moving down to LA to be an actor. Isn't that something you just kind of are? It's not as if a librarian can just call themselves a librarian without collecting a paycheck. They got to work. That's correct, Ms. Katys. So Garrett is moving down to Los Angeles to try to earn a livings as an actor. Can you do that? Do whats? Well, earn a living as an actor. That's a thing? Sure it is. So, you can earn a living as an actor, you say? Yeah. How do you think Brad Pitt bought all those paintings and became so passionates about architecture? I would smash that dude with a category five hurricane off the coast. Huh, Garrett's going to LA to make a living as an actor? What a time to be alive. LA people should shut the fuck up. They eat tacos. What's this? What, you've never met one before? That's all they fuckin' talk about. Hey, you like tacos? Let's get some tacos. You know who's got great tacos? Well, these guys have the best tacos. You like tacos, right? Tacos, tacos, tacos. Venice Beach tacos. It's fuckin' fish steak or carnitas wrapped in tortitas. How good can it fucking be? He's right. There! LA people should shut the fuck up about hiking, too. What's this? What, you never met one of them before? It's all they fuckin' talk about. Have you ever been on this hike before? This is the best hike I've ever been on before. Hiking, hiking, hiking. Runyon Canyon. Hiking, hiking, hiking. Just an asshole's word for walkin'. I wasn't born yesterday. It's all tacos and hikes, hikes and tacos. Why don't you ever hike while you have a taco, you fuckin' asshole? But how are youse to know that hikings and tacos aren't better in LA? They are. Aren't they? Everything's better in LA. Says who? People in LA. Yeah, didn't you never not notice that people from up here go down to LA, and then they come back up here calling it, LA? Is that what they do?.  LA. Thank you. LA. And everything's better in LA? What, you never met one of them before? That's all they talk about. What, you've never even been to LA? You have to come to LA, you'll love LA. LA, LA. Toyota Hybrid fucking cars. LA. Oh, yeah, you think you know tacos, eh? I'll tell you, you're some kind of fucking asshole if you think you know tacos, you never had a taco in LA. Think you know hiking? You've never seen a hike until you've had a hike in LA. Ugh, I hate the weather up here it's so much warmer in LA. Oh, yeah, didn't you not know it gets just as cold in LA? It's just different kind of cold in LA. It's a desert, you know? Pull your finger out of your ass. That's exactly what I says, Pull your finger out of your ass.. Now, hold your horses here. Who's do youse knows that's ever beens to LA? What's this about LA?. Whose crib is it anyways?. I dealt, my crib. I loves cribbage. Run of three, that's it for me. Run of four, I'm out the door. Uh, fifteentwo, double on the eight for ten, and jack of suits for elevens, which is a pretty hard numbers to rhymes with. Ooh! What's we gettin' all dressed up for, Mr. Saturday Nights?

You know, I get ending things with Rosie because you have feelings for another woman. She reads too much. She up to somethin'. .and I back that. Thank you, Katy. But. don't you think Tanis is a little. rough around the edges? How do you mean? Isn't her, uh, soil a bit rocky? Isn't her grain a little bit rough for the lays? Well. only one way to find out, super chieftains. So many offseason reps, buddy. So many preseason reps, buddy. Say no to the juice. Ain't fucking baseball, buddy. We dug deep. Buried down. Time to show the boys some gains. Coach's gonna flip when he sees these gains. Gain Gretzky. Gain The Rock Johnson. Shania Gain. Gains, Trains and Automobiles. Let's show these boys that legends walk amongst them. Hashtag, legendlife. You guys wanna go back out and try that again? Maybe it's the lighting in here, but I'm not seeing any gains. But. Doesn't matter. Team folded. Why? There's not enough bodies. Why? 'Cause it's Senior A whalesshit hockey! The way I see it, you got three options. Option number. You can go to the next town and play for them. Travel for whale shit? Gains for whale shit was even a stretch. You didn't get gains. Traveling for whale shit, that's a stretch too far. Option number. Hang 'em up. Well, there's good rubber left in these wheels, though, boys. Let's do power skating, bro. Oh, good call, bro. And option number. Join a championship team right here in Letterkenny. Hmm. .as coaches. .with me. Oh. Team's already won backtoback ships. We've actually never won a ship, buddy. On track to win backtobacktoback boats. Love to win a boat, buddy. Yeah, buddy. Then come on, let's win a fuckin' sea liner. Let's win a Great Lakes freighter. Let's win a cable ferry. Let's win a cabin cruiser. Let's win a Boston whaler. Let's win a recreational trawler. Let's win a paddle steamer! Let's win a pleasure barge. Let's win an outrigger. Let's win a freshwater vessel! Let's win a naval drifter. Let's win a water Rambo! Let's win a landing craft! Let's win a saltwater lugger! Let's win a sea tugger! Let's win a luxuryfuckin'yacht! Let's go!.  Yeah! Wait! You're gonna need an icebreaker. Tanis, how are you now? What? What. What? .the actual fuck was that? What? Well, you're standing, breathing, and smoking, so the other thing, The spitting? Some barefaced, uncultivated version of it, yes. What, you never seen someone spit before? Yes, an inexcusably obese man in the batter's box at a Blue Jays game. But you never seen a girl spit before. Yes, a sixyearold, after consuming an insect in her icecream cone. But you don't think girls should spit. I don't say what girls should do. But you don't like it when girls spit. Preferably not within my line of sight, earshot, and in a perfect world, ever. You hungry? Am I hungry? Yeah, that's what I said. I'm immediately concerned that sensation may never reestablish itself, but what a ride it's been. Oh, don't be so dramatic. What is this, the 1950s? You want me to go borrow an anklelength skirt from my auntie? Come on. I cooked for you. Let's go. Come on. He was supposed to be here over an hour ago. Try him again. Stewart, I just tried him. And? Straight to voicemail. Aggravating. Stewart! Agitating. Stewart! Alarming. Stewart. Roald. I think. I may have a problem. No. No! I'm in over my head! We all want it. I have no control! We all need it! Then where is it? Right here. Get it out! Give it to me. I've got it! It's all right here. But you guys got meth, right? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. The drugs are all over there. Just bring me that computer and get us to the Dark Web. First the meth, then the Dark Web. Roald. You want some, too? I'm good. Bring me the Dark Web over to my standup desk. Why do you have a standup desk? Because sitting is quietly murdering you. Actually, yes, Roald, I. I will have some meth. And here we are. The Dark Web. Why do you guys crave the Dark Web so much? Because the Dark Web is exclusive. The Dark Web is only accessible using special software, users remain untraceable and anonymous on the Dark Web. You can hire a hitman on the Dark Web. Purchase illegal contraband on the Dark Web. Sell illegal contraband on the Dark Web. Or you could join a rebel army. Or you could build a bomb for your own rebel army on the Dark Web. The thrill of having all of that at your fingertips is so.metal! What's on the menu today, chef? I left a tab open for you guys. Something I thought you'd dig. It's funny, the way you last liked that, like the Dark Web site was food. 'Cause. How to cook human meat!. Oh, fuck! These Hard Right mutts again. I don't like these mutts. We could ignore the call. Oh, Stewart! Let's ignore the call. But how are we gonna find cool new things to do on the Dark Web, unless we make cool new pals on the Dark Web. Fine, anything to keep the Dark Web sustainable. But we should sit for this. What are you doing? What? Well, you're sitting, breathing, and taking your boots off, so, the other thing. To borrow a phrase from my stance on social media, I don't follow. Crossing your legs. Yeah, for a hot second, to take my boots off. Boots or no boots, don't you think it's a little fruity loops for a man to be sitting like that? On the contrary, I'm sitting like this because the less bending over a man does, the better. Hmm. Sounds homophobic to me. Sounds chiropractic to me. Hmm. Just checking. I swing both ways, you know? So, if you ever wanted to invite a girl over. or a guy. Are we gonna have a problem here, Tanis? Let's just stop talking, food's ready. Come, eat. What's on the Dark Web menu today, gentlemen?. Funny you put it like that 'cause. We were about to enjoy some Dark Web literature about how to cook human meat until. our friend called. Hmm. 13% of human beings are cannibals, huh? 13% sounds right. Wrong! That's what they want you to think. The truth, 100% of human beings are cannibals. The. The ones on Earth, anyway. How do you know that? How do I know that? Ha! Well, let's rewind the clock. 1840, Ireland, the potato famine forces thousands of those godless, heathen bogtrotters to migrate to North America. No potatoes, you say! Well, then what did those paddymick prods eat on the fuckin' boat over here? Fastforward, 1955, Des Plaines, Illinois, McDonald's restaurants opened their first location. Not a single cow was photographed that day, and yet they're serving burgers? Gotcha. Now McDonald's openly. Openly boasts over 999 billion served. Fastforward, 2016, Donald Trump is elected to office, inherits the highest percentage per capita of cannibals in the world. The leftwing, fake news, pinko media wants you to think that he spent 16 of his first 100 days in office golfing. Wrong. Wrong! Donald J. Trump spent 16 of his first 100 days, as President of the United States, CommanderinChief, leader of the goddamned free world, getting that per capita percentage of cannibals down from 100 to. Everett? Uh. 13%? That's right. Do the math. No, no, actually do. Actually do the math. Do the meth? We did the meth. Listen, uh, friend. We've been listening to you ramble for an hour. We only joined the Dark Web to see cool new things, and join cool new movements. And make cool new pals. Cool new pals, you say? Yes. No. Stewart. I know how you can make all the coolest new pals ever. Spare us the hyperbole. How? Join the Hard Right! I said that like that was leading into another monologue, but it's really just. Just joi. Join the Hard Right. But. Do you like our flag? Oh, you probably. couldn't. Do you like it? I. I designed it. Mmm. Eat up. You're gonna need fuel for later. What. What? .the actual fuck was that now? What now? Well, you're sitting, eating, and breathing, so, the other thing. Burping? Yes. Some primitive, distressing version of it That was nothing. Terrific. You can burp, too. Outstanding. You can fucking fart, if you want. You know why? Because it's normal. But is it fashionable? It's becoming. It's unbecoming. Well, your boyfriend Daryl burps and spits. Dary also chases ducks, draws on the walls, and must be told not to taste or touch everything he sees. That's true. So, is it because I'm a lady? Who's a lady? So, what, you're saying that girls shouldn't burp, too? I don't say what girls should do. Well, men shouldn't shackle women. We made Prohibition happen, watch your step. Already walkin' on eggshells. Done your food? That ship's clear across the pond. Same. Let's go make a fire 'cause it's a beautiful fucking day. Is that what it is? What? Hmm?. Okay, pheasants. We got bacttobacktoback Coast Guard Zodiacs at our fingertips. But full disclosure, this team's got a bit of an attitude problem, all right? Little battle of leadership going on in here. All right? Sure, they got their center console skiffs, but they went through a lot of coaches in the process. Mundane details, boys. We want a twin engine jet boat. We want that cruise ship. That's the attitude, pylons. Now get in there. All right. What the. What are you two doing? Sorry, boys. Ladies. We didn't know you were ladies, boys. Um. Not ladyboys. We didn't know you were ladies. Do you think the door is open to everyone here? Just because MaryAnne looks like she's homeless, doesn't mean you can treat it like a shelter. Fuck you, BettyAnne. But she's right. Door isn't open to everybody here. Just because our mitt looks like the back of Christ's head, doesn't mean you can treat it like a church. Fuck you, MaryAnne. Your mitt looks like Babe Ruth's ball glove from the dirty '30s if 20 more dudes spat chewing tobacco in it. Your mitt's actually a work of art, BettyAnne. Like Salvador Dali's melting clocks, but instead of melting clocks, it's melting salad bowls of offpink icecream. Hmm. I love icecream, MaryAnne. I love all frozen treats. Your mitt looks like I squeezed a cherryred popsicle with a handful of dryer lint. Meet your new team, pheasants. You serious with that turtleneck? You could lose a lot of heat in the neck, as I like to say. You mean, cold? I wouldn't say I'm hot, but. Ugh. Most men I know wouldn't complain about something like that. You see the elephant? You mean next to the bus crash? That's the one. Yeah, I see it. You wanna talk about it? Let's talk about it. A woman can be what she wants. That is so nice of you to allow that. Not what I meant. I'm kidding. A woman should be what she wants. Better. There's no definition of a woman. It's the same as a man, there's no definition. No need to womansplain, I'm aware. But a woman should be with a man she finds.desirable. And vice versa. Like, longterm, like in a relationship. Can't confirm. I don't think you're it, cowboy. Oh, you think?. I know. Good enough. Good stuff. A shortterm. on the other hand. How short? A night. A night? An hour? Maybe more than an hour. A night. A night. Maybe even a morning. Maybe even a morning. 'Cause we didn't do all the things I wanted to do. Well, we talked, we ate. It was good, right? Thank you for supper. My pleasure. We talked, we ate, we sat by the fire. So, then the other thing. Good enough. Good stuff. Just kiddin'!.  Fifteentwo, the rest won't do. Fifteenfour, the rest don't score. Runs of threes, that's its for me's. Youse been playin' all fuckin' night? How'd it go, big brother? Do you all know what, aside from the end there, so fuckin' poorly. Called it. How poorly? So poor. He said, so fuckin' poor. Talkin' about ultra poor. Called it. What did I miss?. Taco night. But not just any taco night. LA taco night. Oh, there's no taco night like an LA taco night. Oh, yeah. You've never had taco night unless you've had an LA taco night. Oh, yeah. Well, if it's taco night in LA, then you must have had a hike. Did youse have a hike?. Oh, yeah. You can't have taco night in LA without havin' a hike. Oh, yeah. We had an LA hike, but it was so cold, it gets so cold in LA. Oh, yeah. It's a deserts, don't you know?. Oh, yeah. It gets just as cold in LA. It's just a different kind of cold in LA. Pull your finger out of your ass. That's what I say, I said pull your finger out of your ass, you're from LA. Oh, yeah. You've got to take La Cienega to La Tijera if you're going to LAX in LA. Oh, yeah. I will have another coldpressed juice 'cause we're in LA. Oh, yeah. I'm just poppin' down to Trader Joe's to load up on kombuchas in LA. Oh, yeah. You can stick your Hybrid Toyotas straight up your ass, it's all about Teslas now in LA. Oh, yeah. It's like you could never usually get a pizza that was that good in LA until now. Oh, yeah. We're gonna have a winter brunch outside on Melrose. 'Cause you can do that in LA. Oh, yeah. I'm taking improv classes at the UCBs, but only until the groundlings figure it out in LA. Oh, yeah. You better get joined in a burlesque troupe if you're going to LA. LA. LA. LA. LA? LA. LA. LA. LA. LA. LA. Pull your finger out of your ass. That's what I say, I said pull your finger out of your ass.
