<START> You were sippin' suds with your buds the other day. <STOP> <START> Hey, Dary, real quick. "Blank, lunch and dinner." Brehfekst. <STOP> <START> Oh, boy. <STOP> <START> Can I be honest with you guys for a sec? <STOP> <START> Oh, careful, Dary. <STOP> <START> I'd suggest everything you've said up until now has been a lie. <STOP> <START> And you've said lots of things. <STOP> <START> Like, when someone starts a sentence with "Don't take this the wrong way." Guess what? <STOP> <START> I already did. <START> Yeah, the same thing if people start a sentence by saying, "<START> You're gonna hate me for saying this." Guess what? <STOP> <START> I already do. <STOP> <START> Or, when people start a sentence by saying, "<START> You're not gonna wanna hear this." Guess what? <STOP> <START> I already don't. <STOP> <START> No, it's just an observation. <STOP> <START> Well I'm curious as to know why you thought it required a preface. <STOP> <START> Well, because I'm aware of how it might sound. <STOP> <START> Quit beatin' around the bush, Dary. <START> Yeah, Dary, I don't remember you been such an aroundthebush beater. <STOP> <START> Oh, fine, now I'm not even gonna say it. <STOP> <START> Say it. <STOP> <START> The only thing worse than saying, "<START> You're not gonna wanna hear this," is when someone says they have something to say, and they don't say it. <START> You're digging your heels in like a 12yearold girl. <STOP> <START> When in doubt, spit's it out. <STOP> <START> Okay, fine, I'm gonna say it. <STOP> <START> Okay, here goes. <START> You know microbrewing? <STOP> <START> Like, craft beer? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> I always thought it was "craft beard," on account of the guys who make it always have beards. <STOP> <START> So, it was all that for just this then, eh? <STOP> <START> Thank you for inviting us into the circle of trust, Dary. <STOP> <START> I believe the preferred term is, "lumbersexuals." Well, "craft beard" makes a pocketload more sense. <START> You know, craft beards doesn't really bother me. <STOP> <START> But it's the clever wordplay that goes into the naming of it that I finds hard to swallow. <STOP> <START> Like, "So hoppy together," or "Barley breathing." Now, why don't you just call them what it is? <STOP> <START> It's fuckin' beer. "Beer and headlights." <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> I'll contribute. "Ale by comparison." Stout and about. <STOP> <START> Sounds actually pretty good, "Stout and about." Stout and about's not bad at all, actually. <STOP> <START> I'd drink some stout and about. <STOP> <START> I'm surprised we're not drinking a stout and about right now. <STOP> <START> I think what you wanna do is you wanna put an animal in the name 'cause people love animals. <STOP> <START> Like, "Cute Koala Cream," or "Happy Hamster Honey." No, no. <STOP> <START> What you wanna do is you wanna put a berry in the name 'cause people love berries. "Partridge Berry Pilsner," or "Alderberry Ale." Pleasing to the ears and the mouth. <STOP> <START> No, Dary. <STOP> <START> Dary, no. <STOP> <START> No, Dan. <STOP> <START> Dan, no. <STOP> <START> No, Katy. <STOP> <START> Katy, no. <STOP> <START> What you're exposed to do, is put something cozy in the names 'cuz people like being cozy, right? <STOP> <START> Like "toque" or "mittens." And then, if you really wanna double down on it, you put something outdoorsy in the name because people love being outdoors. <STOP> <START> Like, "lake," or "mountains." So what it's really gonna boil down to is "Toque Lake Brew co," or "Mountain Mittens Alpine Ale." "Blanket Fire Light." There you go, Dary. <STOP> <START> The other ways to go is to use a clever, but ironical statement. <STOP> <START> Like, "I'm bitters." See, I'd go suggestive. <STOP> <START> Like, "Slipitin cider." Katy. <STOP> <START> What? <STOP> <START> Let's get this gal a fuckin' puppers. <STOP> <START> Dary, have a shot? <STOP> <START> I'd have a shot. <STOP> <START> Dan, have a shot? <STOP> <START> I'd have a shot. <STOP> <START> McMurray, have a shot? <STOP> <START> I'll have a shot. <STOP> <START> Tyson, have a shot? <STOP> <START> I'll have a shot. <STOP> <START> JB, have a shot? <STOP> <START> I'll have a shot. <STOP> <START> Fuck, boys. let's have a shot. <STOP> <START> G'day? <STOP> <START> Et JeanCarl. <STOP> <START> Et JeanPierre. <STOP> <START> Mes amis. <STOP> <START> Are you's up at your chalet in the Laurentians having a Laurentide, or what? <START> You know, you's got some pretty choice gins there in Qbec. <START> You ought to hammer on one of those. <STOP> <START> Can do. <STOP> <START> What, like, a buckanddoe? <STOP> <START> Numbers? <STOP> <START> Well, I happen to be sitting with the first team allstars as we speak. <STOP> <START> A bientot. <STOP> <START> Who wants to go to a buckanddoe in Qbec? <STOP> <START> Staganddoe, I'll never say no. <STOP> <START> A JackandJill, always a thrill. <STOP> <START> Drinkanddance till you shit your pants. <STOP> <START> Love a good turnandstomp. <STOP> <START> Love a sipandspin. <STOP> <START> What's a sipandspin? <STOP> <START> Who the fuck are you? <STOP> <START> A sipandspin. <STOP> <START> Staganddoe. <STOP> <START> JacksandJills. <STOP> <START> Drinkanddance. <STOP> <START> Turnandstomp. <STOP> <START> Or a buckanddoe, is a prewedding party thrown by the best man and maid of honor to raise money for the bride and groom's big day. <STOP> <START> Oh, cool. <STOP> <START> Get the fuck out of here, dude. <STOP> <START> In Winnipeg, they call them "socials."
