<START> You were sippin' suds with your buds the other day. <START> Hey, Dary, real quick. "Blank, lunch and dinner." Brehfekst. <START> Oh, boy. <START> Can I be honest with you guys for a sec? <START> Oh, careful, Dary. <START> I'd suggest everything you've said up until now has been a lie. <START> And you've said lots of things. <START> Like, when someone starts a sentence with "Don't take this the wrong way." Guess what? <START> I already did. <START> Yeah, the same thing if people start a sentence by saying, "<START> You're gonna hate me for saying this." Guess what? <START> I already do. <START> Or, when people start a sentence by saying, "<START> You're not gonna wanna hear this." Guess what? <START> I already don't. <START> No, it's just an observation. <START> Well I'm curious as to know why you thought it required a preface. <START> Well, because I'm aware of how it might sound. <START> Quit beatin' around the bush, Dary. <START> Yeah, Dary, I don't remember you been such an aroundthebush beater. <START> Oh, fine, now I'm not even gonna say it. <START> Say it. <START> The only thing worse than saying, "<START> You're not gonna wanna hear this," is when someone says they have something to say, and they don't say it. <START> You're digging your heels in like a 12yearold girl. <START> When in doubt, spit's it out. <START> Okay, fine, I'm gonna say it. <START> Okay, here goes. <START> You know microbrewing? <START> Like, craft beer? <START> Yeah. <START> I always thought it was "craft beard," on account of the guys who make it always have beards. <START> So, it was all that for just this then, eh? <START> Thank you for inviting us into the circle of trust, Dary. <START> I believe the preferred term is, "lumbersexuals." Well, "craft beard" makes a pocketload more sense. <START> You know, craft beards doesn't really bother me. <START> But it's the clever wordplay that goes into the naming of it that I finds hard to swallow. <START> Like, "So hoppy together," or "Barley breathing." Now, why don't you just call them what it is? <START> It's fuckin' beer. "Beer and headlights." <START> Yeah. <START> I'll contribute. "Ale by comparison." Stout and about. <START> Sounds actually pretty good, "Stout and about." Stout and about's not bad at all, actually. <START> I'd drink some stout and about. <START> I'm surprised we're not drinking a stout and about right now. <START> I think what you wanna do is you wanna put an animal in the name 'cause people love animals. <START> Like, "Cute Koala Cream," or "Happy Hamster Honey." No, no. <START> What you wanna do is you wanna put a berry in the name 'cause people love berries. "Partridge Berry Pilsner," or "Alderberry Ale." Pleasing to the ears and the mouth. <START> No, Dary. <START> Dary, no. <START> No, Dan. <START> Dan, no. <START> No, Katy. <START> Katy, no. <START> What you're exposed to do, is put something cozy in the names 'cuz people like being cozy, right? <START> Like "toque" or "mittens." And then, if you really wanna double down on it, you put something outdoorsy in the name because people love being outdoors. <START> Like, "lake," or "mountains." So what it's really gonna boil down to is "Toque Lake Brew co," or "Mountain Mittens Alpine Ale." "Blanket Fire Light." There you go, Dary. <START> The other ways to go is to use a clever, but ironical statement. <START> Like, "I'm bitters." See, I'd go suggestive. <START> Like, "Slipitin cider." Katy. <START> What? <START> Let's get this gal a fuckin' puppers. <START> Dary, have a shot? <START> I'd have a shot. <START> Dan, have a shot? <START> I'd have a shot. <START> McMurray, have a shot? <START> I'll have a shot. <START> Tyson, have a shot? <START> I'll have a shot. <START> JB, have a shot? <START> I'll have a shot. <START> Fuck, boys. let's have a shot. <START> G'day? <START> Et JeanCarl. <START> Et JeanPierre. <START> Mes amis. <START> Are you's up at your chalet in the Laurentians having a Laurentide, or what? <START> You know, you's got some pretty choice gins there in Qbec. <START> You ought to hammer on one of those. <START> Can do. <START> What, like, a buckanddoe? <START> Numbers? <START> Well, I happen to be sitting with the first team allstars as we speak. <START> A bientot. <START> Who wants to go to a buckanddoe in Qbec? <START> Staganddoe, I'll never say no. <START> A JackandJill, always a thrill. <START> Drinkanddance till you shit your pants. <START> Love a good turnandstomp. <START> Love a sipandspin. <START> What's a sipandspin? <START> Who the fuck are you? <START> A sipandspin. <START> Staganddoe. <START> JacksandJills. <START> Drinkanddance. <START> Turnandstomp. <START> Or a buckanddoe, is a prewedding party thrown by the best man and maid of honor to raise money for the bride and groom's big day. <START> Oh, cool. <START> Get the fuck out of here, dude. <START> In Winnipeg, they call them "socials." Can confirm. <START> You know, Winnipeg has a very large Ukranian population. <START> Not too many people know that. <START> Hey, Jewish and Italian, too. <START> Not too many people know that. <START> Whose gulp and grind is it? <START> Remember Anik? <START> Oh. <START> Well, that's why you gotta strike while the iron's hot, big shooter. <START> Another French gal that got away. <START> I can't catch a break. <START> Who's drivin'? <START> Oh, fuck, not me, I'm hammered. <START> Dary, you hammered? <START> Oh, I'm hammered. <START> Dan, you hammered? <START> Oh, I'm hammered. <START> McMurray, hammered?. <START> I'm hammered. <START> Tyson, you hammered? <START> I'm hammered. <START> JB, you hammered? <START> I'm hammered. <START> Fuck, boys, we're hammered. <START> And how's that for ya? <START> Well, it's not too bad for me, but right about now it's not smart, really. <START> Well, I'm not missin' out on French boys. <START> Look, I'll drive, but I'm not fittin' all of youse in my truck. <START> Pete and Repeat. <START> Guys wanna go to a buck and doe? <START> Oh, fuck, yeah. <START> I didn't even know there's a drink and dance tonight. <START> How we not know about a swingandsway? <START> It's not here, it's in Quebec. <START> I got no reason to say no. <START> Let's slam some rheumy skin. <START> Let's get our meat smoked, boys. <START> Fire a little batch of Celine Dijon. <START> Let's go. <START> Okay. <START> Good. <START> You're drivin'. <START> Hold your horses now, hold your horses. <START> All right? <START> McMurray, how are you, now? <START> I'm a teensy bit concerned, Wayne. <START> How's that? <START> What's the problem, McMurray? <START> Youse guys got some French pals who want us English dudes to go to their party in Quebec, right? <START> Right as Dan's jerk hand. <START> Right. <START> Except, youse gotta realize that, in all likelihood, your French pals probably have some French pals who doesn't want us English dudes to go to their party in Quebec. <START> Right? <START> Left. <START> Right. <START> Quebec damn near left Canada. <START> Separatism is alive and well in Quebec right now, mon freres. <START> Well, they just had the referendum damn near yesterday. <START> Mmm. <START> If, by "yesterday," you mean a quarter of centuries ago, then, yeah, I can back that. <START> I said, "It feels like."
