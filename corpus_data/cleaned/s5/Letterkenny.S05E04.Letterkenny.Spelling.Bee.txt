Your friend Dary said he can beat up your friend Dan the other day. You're dreaming, bud.. Am not.. Are, too. You're Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, bud. All I'm saying is, if it came down to it and I hope it wouldn't... Well, see you're soft on it already, Dary. I could beat Dan in a fight. You're mixing a Hardy, bud. Am not. Are, too. You're down there mixing a Tom Hardy. Oh, I would smash that dude like a Terry's Chocolate Orange Same. How's your beers?. I'll have a beer. Must be nice, you can pick up some extra shifts here while Gail's down at her South American Single's Resort, huh, Bonnie? You wanna know what? If two of my bars burnt down I'd be fucking off, too. I'm envious of that old goat. It's light lifting. This place could run off honor system if it had to.. Okay, Katy and Bonnie, who do you think would win a fight, me or Dan? Dan. Why don't you two just arm wrestle and get to the bottom of it. No. Why not? Well, because arm wrestling is not a legitimate barometer for strength, and certainly not toughness. You're either born a good arm wrestler or you're not. Youse could leg wrestle.. No. Why not? Well, because if they're on the floor rubbing their legs together, they've both lost. How are we gonna sort this out? Oh, youse could have to fight. No. Sure. See, you're a good friend, Dan. How is Dan a good friend in all of this? Well, Dan sees you're quite upset about this. He's willing to put his beer down, come over there and beat the shit out of you so that you're over it. Tyson, who would win in a fight between Dan and Dary? Dary.. Yes.. Why? Longer reach, quicker on his feet. Not above a nut shot or a hair pull. Joint Boy? Squirrelly Dan.. Why? 'Cause he's Squirrelly. Who do youse think would win in a fight between you two?. Me.. You?. Me. See, now there's a good friend. Fifteenfour and I'd hoped for more. Fifteentwo, that's where it's new. Zeros, which is also knowns as a 19's hand, 'cause a 19's hand is impossibles to get in the games of Cribbage.  Coolin' down out there, folks. Down to about 10 degReese's Peanut Butter Cups. Anywho... Based on length of past spelling bees, coupled with speller proficiency, this year's bee will be single knockout. Sudden death overtime begins right now. Could I use the toilet? I don't know. Can you? May I use the toilet? Yes, you may. Katy, the first word is yours. Shut up! Shut your fucking mouth! You think this is the PGA? You can just hoop and holler whenever you want? Baba fucking booey? We respect our athletes here, so sit down, shut up, and enjoy some fucking adult spelling. Katy, your word is "Farceur". Farceur. Can I get a definition, please? A writer or actor of satire. Farceur. Hence, farce. Farceur. FARCEUR. Farceur. Correct. They should be able to clap if she gets one right, Squirrelly Dan. Yeah, like that's what we've done in the past. Yeah, but looks at what happens last years. Yeah, but she's used to getting cheered for, right? We don't want her to get inside of her own head if no one cheers for her. It's the last thing we fucking want. It's too risky, Dan. Okay, I'm sorry for my outburst earlier. I came at you with a lot of anger and that was unnecessary. You can cheer if someone gets a word right, but its starts and ends there. I don't wanna hear a fucking fart out of any of you if someone gets a word wrong. As sure as grandma's got gout, if I hear one fucking heckle, I will staple your tongue to your taint, so you can watch me kick your ass. Jimmy, why don'ts you repeat the last thing you said there? "Correct." Stewart, the next word is yours. Goddamn, it makes me hot when a man can spell. I do love a good tongue. Reilly and Jonesy can't spell for shit. Fucking idiots.

Uh, this is the... Okay. Hockey. Can I hear the word used in a sentence, please? Uh, okay. The Letterkenny Irish are a Senior A whale shit hockey team that recently folded.. Hockey.. H... O... K.... C... C... K... E... Y.... Y?. Yeah. Y. Are you finished?. Yes. Correct. Yeah.. Fucking idiots. Thanks. Joint Boy, the next word is yours. Joint Boy? Joint Boy! I suppose it is his name. Joint Boy... Your word is "Ensconce". Ensconce. Got a fuck load of joints ensconced in this fanny pack. Ensconce. ENSCONCE. Ensconce. Correct. Yes! Can I use the toilet again? Can you cancan?

Definition, please. A colleague or comrade. Confrere. With confreres like this who needs enemies. Okay, "Confrere". CONFRARE. Confrere. Uh, I'm sorry, McMurray, that is incorrect. The proper spelling of confrere is CONFRERE. Exactly what I said. I thought I heard CONFRARE. Well, you're mistaken.. I do apologize. Oh, don't worry about it, Dickskin. Dickins. Exactly what I said. Dickskin. We sure we got the right Master of Ceremonies for this thing here, okay? I think you need to get your earwax checked, Dickskin. Give 'em a fucking break, Jim. They've been spelling their goddamn hearts out up there. Call an intermission. There was no intermission slotted for today's bee. We'll press on.. How many words gots to gets spelled before someone just keels over. Someone's gotta start asking the tough questions around here. I've seen this before, Jim. It's time we learned from it. In the words of arguably the greatest Canadian rock band of all time, The Tragically Hip, "It's a good life if you don't weaken." Also in the words of Gordon Downie, legendary lead singer of The Tragically Hip, "I can make you scared if you want me to.". Hey, okay. That's good then. Fifteen minute intermission, everyone. Sorry about that, Wayne. I'll get her hydrated. Youse get Reilly and Jonesy on Jim Dickins' radar. Some buttfuckery at play there. Jims. Now I know you noticed that Reilly and Jonesy's words are simpler than everyone else's, and quite suspiciously all hockeysrelated. Yep, there's a wee bit of buttfuckery at play here, Jim. This has been the system ever since Uncle Eddie won the very first Letterkenny Adult Spelling Bee. in the late '60s. We must honor it. Exactly. And aren't you guys the ones that are always saying you shouldn't fuck with tradition. It's fucking embarrassing. Jim, McMurray's screwing the system, here. You can't understand what he's saying. He's pulling the wool over your eyes, cowboy. Well, well, well. Ain't not hater quite like a spelling bee hater, now, is there? What's the matter, Tanis? You got some money riding on the bee? Money? There is to be no betting at the Letterkenny Adult Spelling Bee. Your dirty money is an insult to the integrity of the sport. Yeah, Tanis. All this time talking could be spent spelling. It's not called a Spelling Talk, it's called a Spelling Bee, and we're here to be spellers! Where's the bounty.. We're dry. We need sustenance. You smoked like 20 onegram cannons. Like how are you even conscious right now? Fuck. You got this. Katy. This is getting out of hand, Stewart. Too much for you? What? Did you think this would be silent eeeasy?. Yes. Stay hydrated.. There will be no more intermissions, and there better not be any degenerate gambling. Amidst allegations of contest rigging, there will be a new order for the spellers. I will be selecting names randomly from this hat moving forward. Fedora's a dumb fucking hat. It is, but I do believes that that's a dumb fucking trilbys. Joint Boy. The first word is yours.. Fuck. Joint Boy, your word is "Dithyramb". Dithyramb. JOINT. Dithyramb. DITHY... YRAM. Dithyramb. Incorrect. There's a silent B, dumbass.. Fucking idiot. Fuck!

Can I have the definition of the word, please? Having abundant trees or shrubs. Bosky.. Sounds a lot like brosky, buddy. How do you spell brosky? I don't know how to spell anything, buddy.. Fucking idiots.. Maybe we should just take the R out of brosky? I don't think there is an R in brosky. I'm going in on brosky, buddy. Yeah, good luck on brosky, buddy. Fuck, yeah. Brosky, uh... I mean, "Bosky". BOSKI. Bosky. Incorrect. Fucking embarrassing!. McMurray, the next word is yours. McMurray, your word is "Penalty". Penalty. Hey, that was supposed to be Jonesy and Reilly's word. Well, that's fucking embarrassing. Penalty, penalty. PENLY. Penalty. Incorrect. The correct spelling of "Penalty" is PENALTY. Exactly what I said. No, it isn't. Youse ever see that movie Dick Tracy The one with Warren Beatty? I would smash that dude like a neighbor's pumpkin on devil's night. Same. Well, Dick Tracy used a similar machine to slow down and decipher the speech of an appropriatelynamed character, Mumbles. What?. Let me show you. This is Mr. McMurray's answer at normal speed..  PENALTY. Penalty. See? Now this is his answer slowed down..  PENALDY. Witch! McMurray, you're eliminated. Please take a seat offstage. Penalty. Youse want to get hammered? Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached our final two contestants. Let's give them a round of applause.

Which is exactly what I said. No, it isn't..  TRISK ADE KA PHOBIA Silent I win. Champ! Yes! Yeah!. Why? Anyone wanna double me home, ladies? Everyone knows how to spell Triskaidekaphobia. It's the most common word used in spelling bees. I know that, but there is a reason that I spelled... Fucking idiot.. Fucking idiots. Oh, fuck, buddy, it's Coach. Probably gonna ream us out. Fuck, what does he want, buddy?. Who could it be?. Give your balls a tug, you titfucker.
