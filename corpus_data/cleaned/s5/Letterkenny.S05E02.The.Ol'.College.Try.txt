<START> Fastforward, 1955, Des Plaines, Illinois, McDonald's restaurants opened their first location. <START> Not a single cow was photographed that day, and yet they're serving burgers? <START> Gotcha. <START> Now McDonald's openly. <START> Openly boasts over 999 billion served. <START> Fastforward, 2016, Donald Trump is elected to office, inherits the highest percentage per capita of cannibals in the world. <START> The leftwing, fake news, pinko media wants you to think that he spent 16 of his first 100 days in office golfing. <START> Wrong. <START> Wrong! <START> Donald J. <START> Trump spent 16 of his first 100 days, as President of the United States, CommanderinChief, leader of the goddamned free world, getting that per capita percentage of cannibals down from 100 to. <START> Everett? <START> Uh. 13%? <START> That's right. <START> Do the math. <START> No, no, actually do. <START> Actually do the math. <START> Do the meth? <START> We did the meth. <START> Listen, uh, friend. <START> We've been listening to you ramble for an hour. <START> We only joined the Dark Web to see cool new things, and join cool new movements. <START> And make cool new pals. <START> Cool new pals, you say? <START> Yes. <START> No. <START> Stewart. <START> I know how you can make all the coolest new pals ever. <START> Spare us the hyperbole. <START> How? <START> Join the Hard Right! <START> I said that like that was leading into another monologue, but it's really just. <START> Just joi. <START> Join the Hard Right. <START> But. <START> Do you like our flag? <START> Oh, you probably. couldn't. <START> Do you like it? <START> I. <START> I designed it. <START> Mmm. <START> Eat up. <START> You're gonna need fuel for later. <START> What. <START> What? .the actual fuck was that now? <START> What now? <START> Well, you're sitting, eating, and breathing, so, the other thing. <START> Burping? <START> Yes. <START> Some primitive, distressing version of it That was nothing. <START> Terrific. <START> You can burp, too. <START> Outstanding. <START> You can fucking fart, if you want. <START> You know why? <START> Because it's normal. <START> But is it fashionable? <START> It's becoming. <START> It's unbecoming. <START> Well, your boyfriend Daryl burps and spits. <START> Dary also chases ducks, draws on the walls, and must be told not to taste or touch everything he sees. <START> That's true. <START> So, is it because I'm a lady? <START> Who's a lady? <START> So, what, you're saying that girls shouldn't burp, too? <START> I don't say what girls should do. <START> Well, men shouldn't shackle women. <START> We made Prohibition happen, watch your step. <START> Already walkin' on eggshells. <START> Done your food? <START> That ship's clear across the pond. <START> Same. <START> Let's go make a fire 'cause it's a beautiful fucking day. <START> Is that what it is? <START> What? <START> Hmm?. <START> Okay, pheasants. <START> We got bacttobacktoback Coast Guard Zodiacs at our fingertips. <START> But full disclosure, this team's got a bit of an attitude problem, all right? <START> Little battle of leadership going on in here. <START> All right? <START> Sure, they got their center console skiffs, but they went through a lot of coaches in the process. <START> Mundane details, boys. <START> We want a twin engine jet boat. <START> We want that cruise ship. <START> That's the attitude, pylons. <START> Now get in there. <START> All right. <START> What the. <START> What are you two doing? <START> Sorry, boys. <START> Ladies. <START> We didn't know you were ladies, boys. <START> Um. <START> Not ladyboys. <START> We didn't know you were ladies. <START> Do you think the door is open to everyone here? <START> Just because MaryAnne looks like she's homeless, doesn't mean you can treat it like a shelter. <START> Fuck you, BettyAnne. <START> But she's right. <START> Door isn't open to everybody here. <START> Just because our mitt looks like the back of Christ's head, doesn't mean you can treat it like a church. <START> Fuck you, MaryAnne. <START> Your mitt looks like Babe Ruth's ball glove from the dirty '30s if 20 more dudes spat chewing tobacco in it. <START> Your mitt's actually a work of art, BettyAnne. <START> Like Salvador Dali's melting clocks, but instead of melting clocks, it's melting salad bowls of offpink icecream. <START> Hmm. <START> I love icecream, MaryAnne. <START> I love all frozen treats. <START> Your mitt looks like I squeezed a cherryred popsicle with a handful of dryer lint. <START> Meet your new team, pheasants. <START> You serious with that turtleneck? <START> You could lose a lot of heat in the neck, as I like to say. <START> You mean, cold? <START> I wouldn't say I'm hot, but. <START> Ugh. <START> Most men I know wouldn't complain about something like that. <START> You see the elephant? <START> You mean next to the bus crash? <START> That's the one. <START> Yeah, I see it. <START> You wanna talk about it? <START> Let's talk about it. <START> A woman can be what she wants. <START> That is so nice of you to allow that. <START> Not what I meant. <START> I'm kidding. <START> A woman should be what she wants. <START> Better. <START> There's no definition of a woman. <START> It's the same as a man, there's no definition. <START> No need to womansplain, I'm aware. <START> But a woman should be with a man she finds.desirable. <START> And vice versa. <START> Like, longterm, like in a relationship. <START> Can't confirm. <START> I don't think you're it, cowboy. <START> Oh, you think?. <START> I know. <START> Good enough. <START> Good stuff. <START> A shortterm. on the other hand. <START> How short?
