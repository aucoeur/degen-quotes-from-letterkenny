"The only constant in life is change"? <START> It's a wee bit to wrap your head around there. <START> Well, the only constant around here is everything stays the sames. <START> Anywho. <START> According to the writers of the Letterkenny Banner, the whole world's going to hells in a hand baskets. <START> Sounds about right. <START> Probably for the best. <START> We had a good run. <START> As long as we're going in a hand basket. <START> As opposed to what kind of basket? <START> Well, there's a bazillion different kinds of baskets. <START> Hand and waste paper. <START> What else? <START> Okay, so maybe there's not a bazillion different kinds, but. <START> Yeah, it's definitely not a bazillion different kinds. <START> Yeah, that's what I just said, "There's not a bazillion different kinds of baskets." <START> Well, don't come in here saying "bazillion" unless you mean a bazillion. <START> Okay. <START> I was just for emphasis. <START> I was saying, "Bazillion different kinds of baskets."

<START> Why not just be a big bunch of Rough Riders? <START> Why don't you just name the whole league the Rough Riders? <START> Why even stop there? <START> Why don't we just go ahead and name the whole human race Rough Riders? <START> Like, you see what I'm saying. <START> Yeah. <START> Today, we're all Rough Riders. <START> What exactly is a Rough Rider? <START> I don't know. <START> All's I'm saying is that there's too many of them. <START> Don't you see?. <START> So, what else is in the running?. <START> Ah, second place is the Letterkenny Muff Riders. <START> Yeah, I can get behind Muff Riders. <START> Hmm. <START> What else?

<START> Must be some hightech dark web shit. <START> Stu? <START> Stu! <START> Appreciate the Stooges reference. <START> Everyone knows Curly was the original skinhead. <START> Plus Ron Asheton from Iggy and the Stooges had a real Third Reich obsession. <START> Good Christ! <START> It smells like somebody's been smoking gate waves in here. <START> The Chiefs are changing their name. <START> Who? <START> Your beloved junior soccer team. <START> Who? <START> Ah! <START> Nobody cares about anything anymore. <START> What about the history? <START> The tradition? <START> What's a junior soccer team?

<START> The hard right, that's who. <START> Chiefs is a strong name. <START> I remember a time when being called a chief was a good thing. <START> People like to root for a chief. <START> This used to be the heartland. <START> Now, it is just the other heartland of farleft liberal cucks. <START> Did somebody get their feelings hurt? <START> Did somebody sign a petition? <START> Uh, news flash, you're all caving to PC culture. <START> You're just a bunch of farleft liberal fucking pinko snowflakes. <START> Oh, we've been called worse. <START> But might as well just change the name to Letterkenny Cucks. <START> Regional champs of Cuckistan! <START> Okay. <START> This is what the failed patriarchy looks like. <START> I'm so sick of you beta male SJ<START> Ws. <START> We're not SJ<START> Ws. <START> I actually identify as a wood nymph. <START> Super weird. <START> Be gone. <START> Oh, we'll be gone. <START> Just as soon as you betas show us where the alphas are. <START> I'll see myself out. <START> I assume all of you are following suit. <START> He talks more than I do. <START> That was weird. <START> Ah, yes! <START> Now we're talking. <START> The alphas. <START> Real men. <START> No matriarchy in sight. <START> Who the fuck are you?

<START> You wanna see how deep this rabbit hole really goes? <START> Or are you guys globalists? <START> What's that? <START> Ah! <START> I'll admit, I was anticipating the low energy, country cuck road show, but you're curious. <START> Color me glad. <START> It's time to wake up. <START> It's time for you to spit out all of the toxic sludge you've been spoon fed by the Ian Hanomansings and the Gloria Macarenkos of the world. <START> We are a movement. <START> Bowel movement by the looks of it. <START> Ah, hachimachi, I like your fire. <START> We could use more women in the movement. <START> We have next to none, for reasons we can't quite decode. <START> Pitter patter. <START> Yes, pitter patter. <START> All lives matter. <START> News flash, the out of control PC police are forcing your beloved Letterkenny Chiefs to change their name. <START> Yeah, we caught that. <START> Yeah, well, we're here to protest that. <START> Our legions of brothers will be joining me at John Letterkenny Field later. <START> And we want you, the salt of the earth alphas, the stewards of traditional morals, traditional values, the silent majority, to join us. <START> The fight against poor, uneducated libtards requires nothing short of a massacre. <START> Now you're a bit fucking dramatic, eh? <START> Why is keeping the name of the Chiefs important to you?. <START> It isn't. <START> Oh, oh, it's not. <START> It isn't? <START> Well, not really, in the long run. <START> Nor the short run, really. <START> Yeah, no need to get your jimmies all out of joint. <START> Well, but you. <START> You understand why it's important to fight the left? <START> Yes? <START> I didn't know it was necessary, much less important. <START> The point is the government is trying to keep you and your humble agricultural livelihoods thoroughly cucked. <START> It's time to wake up and smell the chem trails. <START> It's time to stand up for your God given right to have kickass names for all your favorite teams, and fuck anybody whose feelings get hurt along the way. <START> Oh, is that what time it is? <START> Oh, you think I don't have feelings? <START> You think my feelings don't get hurt? <START> My grandfather has a pacemaker, right? <START> Every time I watch the Indiana Pacers play basketball, it makes me think of Papi. <START> And his irregular heartbeat. <START> And it fucks me up, big time. <START> You see me complaining to the Indiana Pacers or anyone in the NBA? <START> Mmm, suck it up, buttercup. <START> So? <START> So what? <START> So join us. <START> Tell you what. <START> I'll fight you for it. <START> You and me. <START> Sorry, what? <START> What I'm saying is, I'll fight you. <START> And if you win I'll come to the field with you. <START> But if you lose, we're not asking for anything in return. <START> Ah, you SJ<START> Ws are a lost cause. <START> I'm going to troll! <START> Letterkenny Chiefs! <START> Letterkenny Chiefs! <START> We can do this, buddy. <START> We can establish order, buddy. <START> I know we can. <START> HARD RIGHT. <START> Of course you can. <START> Ah. <START> Hockey, eh?

<START> Uh, it's a pasta, bro. <START> Uh, it's pronounced "pahsta," bro. <START> Is it? <START> Today, it's the Letterkenny Chiefs. <START> Tomorrow, it'll be your beloved Shamrocks. <START> Well, you know, the Chiefs is kinda not PC though, buddy. <START> We try to keep it, like, kind of in touch there. <START> What if they decide to get butt hurt over the Letterkenny Shamrocks name next and force you to change it just because they don't know how to control their. <START> Their fragile beta male emotions? <START> What then, huh? <START> You don't see a bunch of Irish people protesting here, do you? <START> No, you don't. <START> They're not,. "Argh, please change your name!" None of that's happening. <START> You wanna know why? <START> Because Irish people don't fucking complain about anything, all right? <START> Irish people know how to take it like a champ, okay? <START> You take their potatoes away, they don't say a fucking thing. <START> It's pronounced "potahto." Is it? <START> It's called "manning up," gentlemen. <START> You might want to look into it. <START> What do you think, buddy? <START> I think this guy's a goof, buddy. <START> Cool, buddy. <START> Yeah, but. <START> On that note, I'm not really a fan of the Shamrocks name. <START> Really? <START> Yeah. <START> Me too, buddy. <START> I mean, if we're talking about some kind of negative stereotype attached to that name, you know? <START> Right? <START> It's like, just because my name is Reilly, that doesn't necessarily mean that I'm a drunken leprechaun. <START> Maybe we should change the name, buddy. <START> What's this about a name change? <START> If anybody should change their names, it should be us. <START> What the hell's a Shamrockette anyway? <START> A leaf with tits? <START> Oh, this isn't your matriarch, is it? <START> You can't just add "ette" to the end of the men's team and expect women to like it. <START> We should change our names to something fierce and feminine and powerful. <START> Like the Screaming Banshees. <START> That's good, MaryAnne. <START> Impressive creativity. <START> Couple of hens clucking away. <START> Especially for a girl who had to start kindergarten two years late because she couldn't grasp coloring. <START> I've plenty of good ideas, BettyAnne. <START> Like convincing your dad to get a vasectomy so I wouldn't have to worry about another you coming into the world while I fucked him. <START> We were just starting to get them under control. <START> You're screwing it up, bro. <START> You're getting them all fired up again. <START> Bringing family into it now, MaryAnne? <START> I would never stoop so low, especially with the recent passing of your mother, who told me before she died that my dad is your dad too. <START> You're fucking up our progress, man. <START> Just get out of here. <START> It's only gonna get worse too. <START> Thanks a lot. <START> Ah, these Tumblrinas have lost the plot anyway. <START> Letterkenny Chiefs! <START> Letterkenny Chiefs! <START> Where the fuck is everybody? <START> This is supposed to be a protest. <START> We need people to protest and piss off and agitate. <START> Ay, ay, ay. <START> Whose idea was this stupid name change anyway?. <START> Ours. <START> S'up, Nazis? <START> Nazi? <START> Hilarious. <START> Ain't nothing funny about this, honky. <START> No, but Nazi, really? <START> Nazi? <START> Would a Nazi ride a Yamaha scooter? <START> A pansy Nazi? <START> Sure. <START> Would a Nazi have a Jew for a lawyer? <START> Could you refer me, asshole?
