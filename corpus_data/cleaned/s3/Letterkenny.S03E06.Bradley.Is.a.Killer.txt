<START> You were havin' breakfast with your pals the other day. <START> Fuck were youse drunk last night. <START> You know, I can't stand it when you guys get really, really, really drunk. <START> Wasn't s'bad. <START> It was s'goddamn bad. <START> You get super annoying when you're really, really, really drunk. <START> Right, scary Dary? <START> Please leave me alone. <START> Pushing your nipples against everyone all night? <START> And what about you, madman Dan? <START> Or should I say, Legend of the Wind? <START> It's Squirrelly Dan, Miss Katy. <START> Challenging everyone to a foot race? <START> Get real. <START> Please stop shouting at me, Miss Katy. <START> And let's not skim over Wayne the Pain. <START> Mind your own beeswax, Katy. <START> You have the most annoying fuckin' laugh on planet fuckin' Earth, when you get really, really, really, drunk. <START> Clean it up! <START> There's a new addition to the Squirrelly Dan famdamly. <START> I've seen that in the paper. <START> What's the scoop there, big shooter? <START> Well, Samuel's. <START> I fuckin' hate Samuel. <START> He's a Big Brother's now. <START> Oh, I fuckin' hate Samuel so much. <START> Well, that's interesting, maybe make Samuel straighten up, fly right there. <START> That's what I said. <START> Youse did pot today, didn't ya's. <START> No. 'Cause youse are talkin' like youse did pot. <START> Why? <START> Because that logic is Titanic on the ocean floor busted. <START> Why? <START> Well, it's like when a celebrity gets all fucked up on snooters and such. <START> They think that the solution to sortin' themselves out is to get a puppy. <START> What's wrong with a puppy? <START> Well, I'm just sayin', doesn't it seem more appropriate to sort yourself out before bringing a beating heart into your own home, rather than relying on that beating heart to sort yourself out? <START> Snooters and such. <START> Uh, hmm, I had my go with snooters and such. <START> Small town spawn snooters and such. <START> Degens do snooters and such. <START> Over and out. <START> I'd have to agree. <START> I think it's differents for Samuel's, he's just a sixyearsold with a penchants for mischief. <START> Someone needs to hit that kid. <START> I thinks for a sixyearsold introducing a little brother's into the mix might just be what he needs to inspires him to sort's himself out. <START> I have to agree. <START> It's like Samuel who's introducing a little brother to himself to sort himself out. <START> It's different than like a celebrity introducing a puppy to sort himself out after snooters and such. <START> And my cousin says the baby is very smart. <START> Pump the brakes? <START> I'll soft pump. <START> What's the stupidest thing you ever heard in your life? <START> I would like to say, but it's impolite to talk politics at the breakfast table. <START> I'd also likes to say but it's impolite to talk religions at the breakfast table. <START> Well, mine is neither politics or religion so I will say, the stupidest thing I ever heard in my life, is that a baby is smart. <START> Well, hold your horses there, big shoots. <START> My Aunt Nancy works at the nursery down at the hospitals and she says I was the smartest baby she ever did see. <START> Your Aunt Nancy said that I was destined for constant confusion. <START> Are you saying my Aunt Nancy is stupids for saying such things? <START> I love your Aunt Nancy. <START> I owe her a great deal for my personal growth as a young man. <START> I even call her my Aunt Nancy. <START> Please tell her I said hello. <START> I will, good friend. <START> But what, seesuckin', so to speak, makes a baby smart? <START> Well, she says I was always reachin' out for things in my surroundings. <START> And that made you a smart baby? <START> Allegedly's. <START> Okay, Dan. <START> Okay, okay, Dan. <START> Okay, hold your thumb out. <START> I'm gonna be a baby. <START> Ehya. <START> Now what about that suggests I ought to be buildin' rocket ships for NASA in outer space? <START> Your Aunt Nancy said that a baby who shows signs of excitement before it's able to verbally communicate is a sign of intelligence. <START> Aunt Nancy said signs of stimulation. <START> Well, 'cause that means that they're already getting excited about their surroundings. <START> A baby is stimulated by their surroundings. <START> Okay, Dary, okay. <START> Okay, Dary, yeah, okay. <START> Go wideeyed stick your tongue out. <START> I'm gonna be a baby, okay? <START> I'm gonna show you signs of excitement slash stimulation. <START> No but, Dary, like. <START> Like make the sound like you're doing it to a baby. <START> Ehya. <START> Now what about that suggests that I ought to be navigating unchartered neurological pathways in the brain? <START> I expose nothin'. <START> Yeah, realistically. <START> Furthermore, in the midst of excitement slash stimulation, that razor sharp baby is likely to drop a shit in its pants. <START> Unable to control its own bodily functions but smart as a whip, Dan. <START> Imaginable's, but I wouldn't say likely's. <START> Hmm, it's possible. <START> Okay, Dan, okay. <START> Okay, Dary, Dary, okay. <START> Dan, hold your thumb out. <START> Dary, go wideeyed, stick your tongue out, and coo like you're doing it to a baby. <START> I'm gonna be a baby, okay? <START> Clean it up! <START> You suppose you could make the same argument for a dog, but at least you don't have to wipe a dog's poopy bum, do you? <START> What is this buttfuckery? <START> Had a rowdy crowd in last night, boys. <START> Where the fuck from?. <START> Up country. <START> Degens. <START> Fuck! <START> In degens. <START> Offered 'em sex in exchange for peace. <START> No takers, so it's safe to say they were gay degens. <START> Well, we'll just let you runs with that there, Gailer. <START> Look, we've all had a runin with degens from up country. <START> But we figured out a solution. <START> All you have to do is employ the Ginger and Boots to be your bouncers. <START> Degens won't wanna a whiff of this place. <START> Choice idea, Daryl. <START> Also go ahead and change the name of my bar from MoDean's 2 to Ostrich Fuckers while I'm at it. <START> Crazier things have happened. <START> Besides I'm bringin' in my own bouncer. <START> Oh, is he single?
