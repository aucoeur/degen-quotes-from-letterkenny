<STOP> <START> The less you say now, the less you have to apologize for later. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> All I'm saying is, if you're gonna be poopy, maybe go try fishing with somebody else. <STOP> <START> What do I say about the old boss, Dary? <STOP> <START> Old boss is always a dick till you meet the new one. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> Plus, I think, the only other people out here fishing are either Ginger or Boots, who may not have fucked an ostrich like everybody thinks they did. <STOP> <START> Point and fuckin' proof. <START> You give good advice, Wayne. <STOP> <START> Well, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. <STOP> <START> Oh, you're GD right is. <STOP> <START> Let's just hope she doesn't go in one ear and out the other, bud. <STOP> <START> Guess what?

<STOP> <START> Figure it out. <START> You figure it out. <STOP> <START> Like, that's damn near doctorassisted, Dan. <STOP> <START> It's a little bit overripe, but it's not like I'm falling aparts on the inside. <STOP> <START> Do you wanna know what? <STOP> <START> It's time we draw a line in the sand. <STOP> <START> Or the snow, so to speak. <STOP> <START> On farts? <STOP> <START> On farts! <STOP> <START> The less you say now, the less you have to apologize for later. <STOP> <START> Good. <STOP> <START> But I've had it. <STOP> <START> Let's get real here. <START> You rip an appropriate fart, we all have a giggle, salute and pay tribute. <STOP> <START> For a good time, Tim, Tom and Terrence. <STOP> <START> But the inappropriate farts gotta go. <STOP> <START> The inappropriate farts are turning us into a bad time Tony, Todd and Tucker. <STOP> <START> Oh, I can'ts wait. <STOP> <START> And I mean this. <STOP> <START> I can't wait to find out what could possibly be deemed an inappropriates fart. <STOP> <START> Farting in here. <STOP> <START> In here?

<STOP> <START> When you're alone. <STOP> <START> One point for Dary. <STOP> <START> It's always okay to fart when you're alone, but 'cept when you're in elevators. <STOP> <START> That's uncouth. <START> You're trying to rob me of my lifebloods here. <STOP> <START> Or you can roll down the window. <STOP> <START> Another point for Dary. <STOP> <START> But the car must be traveling a minimum of 60 kilometers an hour, so that the fart may be aggressively vacuumed out before penetrating nostrils. <STOP> <START> This is literally all I have going for me. <STOP> <START> If you ask permission? <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> Well, safe to say, if you have to ask for permission it's an inappropriate fart, but I'll still give you a half a point. <STOP> <START> The cheekiness. <STOP> <START> The indecencys of it. <STOP> <START> It's downright abusives, is what it is! <STOP> <START> Hey. <STOP> <START> Is that any way to talk to a guy with two and a half points?

I would say at the top of the list would probably be. <STOP> <START> Racists. <STOP> <START> God damn right. <STOP> <START> Racists is definitely degens. <STOP> <START> That's right, big hoss. <STOP> <START> Exactly. <STOP> <START> So, here's what we could do. <STOP> <START> Now, hear me out, just hear me out. <STOP> <START> What we could do is we advertise a party for ethnicities out here at the shack. <STOP> <START> And we could use the ethnicities to lure out the degens that we wants to beat the shits out of. <STOP> <START> Fuck sakes, that's offsides. <STOP> <START> Well, you didn't let me finish, Boss Hogg. <STOP> <START> So, what we could do, okay, is once we bring the ethnicities out here, we could beat up the degens before they could try to beat up the ethnicities. <START> You're still walkin' a super fine line there, big chief. <START> You didn't let me finish. <STOP> <START> See, what we can do now, is have the ethnicities help us beat up the degens like some kind of fantasy revenge of love of asswhooping. <STOP> <START> I guess I've seen that in a Quentin Tarantino film one or three times. <STOP> <START> Abort. <STOP> <START> There is that one thing you see in the news and immediately think, "What a fuckin' degenerate." Well, to be fair. <STOP> <START> To be fair. <STOP> <START> To be fair. <STOP> <START> To be fair. <STOP> <START> There's more than a couple of things. <STOP> <START> Homophobists. <START> Yeah. <START> Yeah, no. <STOP> <START> Homophobes is definitely degens. <START> You mean, like gaybashing. <STOP> <START> That's the one. <STOP> <START> That's the worst. <START> Yeah, you're right. <STOP> <START> That is so gay. <STOP> <START> Wait, that there is homophobics. <STOP> <START> Who is? <STOP> <START> The less you say now, the less you have to apologize for later. <STOP> <START> Good. <START> You see, Professor Tricia from my women's studies class teaches us that homophobia is not just condemning homosexualitys, but it's also not using the appropriate and preferred terms what homosexuals likes to be called by. <START> Yeah, but they call themselves twinks sometimes. <STOP> <START> Like, I'd be offended by that. <STOP> <START> I might be offended by that, too. <START> You see, where I'm from, sometimes when people think things are dumb or stupid, they just say that it's gay. <START> Yeah, but you're not exposed to say that anymore. <STOP> <START> Are you a homophobes? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Well, 'cause what you said was definitely homophobics. <STOP> <START> Fucks this is a lot of work. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> It's like pickin' stones and doin' hay all at once. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' degens. <STOP> <START> I'm pretty sure you're a homophobist. <STOP> <START> I beat the shit out of you one time for beating up a gay. <START> Yeah, I didn't know he was gay. <STOP> <START> He called me a fag. <STOP> <START> Well, this certainly has come full circle. <START> Yeah, see, but youse being offendeds at being calleds a fag, is also technically homophobics. <STOP> <START> I'm gonna take a fuckin' migraine here. <STOP> <START> Well, see, where I'm from. <STOP> <START> We all knows where youse comes from, McMurray, but times they are a changin'. <STOP> <START> I think we can all agree here that homophobists are degenerates. <START> You call the rest a misunderstanding. <STOP> <START> Call it a fuckin' day here. <STOP> <START> Ah, you had good intentions. <STOP> <START> Well, wait, just so I understand here, using gays to lure degens out here is just as bad, if not worse, than using ethnicities to lure degens out here that we wants to beats the shit out of? <STOP> <START> Christ sake. <STOP> <START> And Tyson didn't even say that the gays would help us beat up the degens, where the ethnicities would. <STOP> <START> So, I think it's obvious here, boys, my idea has a clear edge. <STOP> <START> Mmm, I think it's quite obvious that using human lures is pretty extreme. <STOP> <START> I'd really likes for you to meet Professor Tricia. <STOP> <START> Okay, so using gays is homophobic. <STOP> <START> Tip of the iceberg, bud. <STOP> <START> What about, fake gays? <STOP> <START> Well, what's a fake gays? <STOP> <START> Well, someone who may appear to be gay, but is not actually gay. <STOP> <START> And therefore, it would not be gaybashing. <STOP> <START> Well, yes, you'd wanna avoid a hate crime if you could. <STOP> <START> So, you wants to use fake gays to lures the degens? <STOP> <START> Perhaps. <STOP> <START> Okay, listen. <STOP> <START> Just so long as everyone's heard my messages loud and clears. <STOP> <START> I thinks I can lives with that. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> This has been very diplomatic and rational. <STOP> <START> I think the next step in the order of business here, would be to go and find some fake gays for these degenerates to beat up. <STOP> <START> I know where to look. <STOP> <START> Put a fuckin' shirt on. <STOP> <START> Barts. <START> Yorkie. <STOP> <START> Schultzy. <STOP> <START> Fisky. <STOP> <START> Katy? <STOP> <START> Hey, bud. <STOP> <START> Hey, bud. <STOP> <START> The boys are supposed to have just dusted praccy. <STOP> <START> Aw, twoadays. <STOP> <START> They're on dry land now. <STOP> <START> Unreal. <STOP> <START> Hundy P. <STOP> <START> Been wheelin'? <STOP> <START> Been turnin' on the jets, yeah. <STOP> <START> Some notches on the bed post? <STOP> <START> I've been notching. <STOP> <START> Hashtag notch or die. <STOP> <START> Eat. <STOP> <START> Sleep. <STOP> <START> Notch. <STOP> <START> Who? <STOP> <START> Been making my way up the roster. <STOP> <START> A full roster? <STOP> <START> No callups, obviously. <START> Yeah, of course. <STOP> <START> They're not even schmelts yet. <STOP> <START> And not Reilly and Jonesy. <STOP> <START> I'd never touch them. <STOP> <START> I'd never want to piss you off. <STOP> <START> About that. <START> Yeah? <STOP> <START> Do you remember when you cheated on my brother? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And I went around town telling everyone that I was going to get you? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> But then you left town, so I couldn't. <STOP> <START> Couldn't what?
