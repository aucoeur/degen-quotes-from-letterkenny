You were crushin' Gus N' Bru with your pals the other day. Pound a round of Gus N' Bru, Gailer. Bonnie McMurray. Thank you, Bonnie. No problem, Wayne. How're ya now? Good. And you? Oh, not so bad. Bottoms up, super chieftains. Well, I'll go have a pee. Mmm, breakin' the seal. I'm gonna go beat the piss outta the little fella. Let 'er fly, Dan. You old porcelain painter, get the fuck outta here. Porcelain punishers, Gail. You got a big number one on deck there, big shooter? Go squirt, little Curt.  Go rock one, Dan.

Who's a dad?. You are, Dad! Why? What youse hear? Only dads grunt like that when they stand up. Or sit down. Or come. Over to move the furniture, get the fuck outta here. That was a textbook dad noise, Dan. Okay, youse guys have all been eatin' too many sugar cereals. Don't! 'Cause if you wanna. I haven't had too much sugar cereal. Sit back down, Dan. Why, Miss Katy? Just do it. Okay. How are ya now, Dad? You a minivan or crossover guy, Dad? Up north for some fatherson fishin', Dad? Don't get the kids all riled up before bed, Dad. And, now to be fair.  To be fair. To be fair. To be fair. To be fair.  To be fair. Lots of people emit sounds when they stands up and sits down, not just dads. No, it's mostly just dads. You wanna go toss around the pig skin there, Dad? Can you please drive us to the water park, Dad? Let's go back to Disney World, Dad. Can we, can we, can we, please? Fuck outta here. All right, what's about moms? No, moms would never do that. Moms don't want to age themselves. Dads don't care, though. Fuck, no. Dads don't give a care. It's like, Hey, hon, better go clean up those lawn clippings. All right. Guess I'll watch State of Play later. It's like, uh, Hey, hon, I'm gonna scoot off to book club there, can you watch Bella and Edward?. All right. Just had Field of Dreams PVR'd.  It's like, Hey, babe, I think we should take a vacation without the kids. Sure, Karen,. 'cause I could use more financial stress. Derek, I'm going to the Fantasia Party with the girls. Can you unload the dishwasher? Of course, Susan. I guess I'm jerkin' off again tonight. Youse is hilarious. All my friends is smart alecks. All my friends is smart alecks. Just a bunch of smart alecks. Guess I'm jerkin' off again tonight. See, like, not all dad noises are bad dad noises. So, like maybe sometimes mom might say, Hey, hon, the kids are gone away campin' for the weekend, why don't we do some toe curlin'? And then dad might lean into a real Tony the Tiger dad noise. Like. Great! Sure thing, Bonnie. See you soon. Hmm. What's the frequency, Kenneth? Bonnie McMurray has invited us to a hot tub party. Well, who doesn't love a hot tub party? Dary? I would love to go to a hot tub party at Bonnie McMurray's. Daniel? Oh, I wouldn't miss Bonnie's hot tub party for the world. Youse two should take a deep breath. That's a good way to get hemorrhoids. Yeah, that, or sitting on a cold surface. Now that's an old wives' tale. No, it isn't. No, it isn't. Yes, it is. Figure it out.  She's mine! Let's get these guys a fuckin' Puppers. You heard me say it. Because I heard me say it, and I know you heard me say it. I'm sweet on Bonnie McMurray. Oh, yeah? And how's that workin' out for you, big shooter? What's the problem?  Bonnie McMurray. You're both sweet on Bonnie McMurray?. Yes. You know, I have had a busy winter, but I'd toss my hat in the ring there, too. Did youse do pot today?  Yes.  No.  Why? Well. She's a bit young, isn't she? Well, she's 20. Well, I'm only. Doesn't matter. And I'm just. Don't care.   She's mine! Well, she's a pretty girl. It's just, uh. Could let the paint dry a wee bit there, eh? I'll tell you what, Dan. What, Dary? Let's let her decide. It's always her decision! The battle for Bonnie McMurray begins. Do you know sperms can stay alive in hot tubs?   How're ya now? It's not us. Not s'bad. Did you hear me, shirttucker? All the clown costumes, the petty vandalism around Letterkenny, it's not us. I've not heard about it, it mustn't be s'bad. Remember when I said it was petty? See, we've got our hands full of degens from up country. Okay. You do you, boo, I'll take care of this. Over and out.  That true about sperms in hot tubs? No. But the writers of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles could have kinda run with that if they wanted to.    Roald.  Stewart. How long have we been original NES gaming?. Two hours Contra, two hours Ninja Gaiden, two hours Teenage Mutant Nina Turtles, two hours Simon's Quest, two hours Mega Man 2. Ten hours. Ish. Yeah. There's heat on FAKU after our most recent ruckus. It's best we nest.  We should stop.   No.  No?  What do you mean.  I know what she means. No, we don't stop gaming. No?  Did I stutter?. No, you did not. Too much left to delve. Now, I'm not complaining, but these games are between 20 and 30 years old. You're not. Bored? Far from blase. Wondrous. What's next? We haven't even ransacked the sports games yet. Guilty pleasures. Pleasures, no less. Tecmo Super Bowl.  PunchOut!!  Hoops.  Excitebike.  Blades of Steel.  American Gladiators.  California Games.  But after that. NES Open? Baseball Simulator 1.000?  Paperboy!  No. Let's do something else.  Do you guys like dancing? Fuck it. Let's go.  Hold it. You're not going anywhere. Smells like. Feet in here. Eh? Playersonly meeting. Playersonly meeting, ferda. Now, we're close, boys. We're gonna get that W, but there's still some spring cleaning to take care of before this team comes together. Some housekeeping, ferda. Now. To truly come together as a team. And get W's. Order must be established. And to establish order, we must implement fines. Reilly will be your commissioner. Jonesy will be cocommissioner plus treasurer. I'll be collecting fines, boys. Give your balls a tug, you titfucker. Shorsey. Hmm. You bring me to fine number one. Boys, I wake up in the middle of the night dryheaving at the amount of bush in this room. We thought tummystick hedgehogs were extinct, boys. Shave your fuckin' junk hair, boys. It's disgusting, boys. And Shorsey is the guiltiest of 'em all!  Reilly will be your bush inspector. And Jonesy will be your associate bush inspector. Plus. GM of bush. Now, we were really hard on you guys last year before we were bush inspector, associate bush inspector, and GM of bush, so. We're appointing Barts as Senior Director of Bush Operations. Appointing Yorkie Senior Scout in Charge of Bush Development. First fine goes to Shorsey!. Fuck your entire fucking life, bud. From now on, $20 fine, every game and praccy 'til she's shaved down to the wood. As bald as a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, Shoresey!  Titfucker.  On to the second order of business. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Boomtown. There are certain things that stand directly in the way of a team coming together. There are certain things that stand in the way of W's, buddy. And if you truly want this team to come together. And if you want this team to get W's. We're gonna need to see your junk, buddy. Don't feel bad. There are junk hiders on every team. But I think I speak for the entire room when I say. What are you hiding down there, bud? Something weird going on down there, bud? Again, don't feel bad. I mean, some teams have guys that don't even shower after praccy, which is worse than bush. But, we see you face the wall in the room when your junk's out, and you face the wall in the shower when your junk's out. You've seen my junk. Let's see your junk, buddy. Pull it out, buddy. Whip it out, buddy. Let's have a look at your junk. Unsheathe it, bro. You ever got in someone's car in your wet swim trunks and had them turn on the seat warmers? No. Kinda makes you feel like you've peed. You know, big brother, that's almost not worth talkin' about. Over 'n out. Ooh. Oh, great! Well, there's fuckin' Tony the Tiger. Hey, Dad. You know what? I got bigger fish to fry tonight. Hi, Bonnie. Hi, Bonnie. Hi, Wayne. How're ya now? Good. And you? Not s'bad. Any good dad noises on the way in?  No. You know what, we've really got all the personalities on display in this hot tub. Like what? Well, you got the guy who sits with his chin in the water. Sure you do. Then you got the guy who sits with their shoulders out. Sure you do. Then you got the guy who takes up two to three times more real estate than everybody else because they're just like. Puttin' the vibe out there. Sure you do. And of course you've got your edge sitters. That's me, Wayne. What's your story over there, hands? I'm the guy who keeps his hands dry so he can still dig out and light smokes. What if it's an outdoor hot tub? Don't your hands get cold? I'm also the guy who would never admit that sort of thing. What about you keep one hand out of the water to dig out smokes and I'll keep one hand out of the water so I can light them. More hands make less work. You're all right, Rosie. So, Bonnie. What are you looking for in a guy? I don't really have a type, I don't think. Okay, but if you had to choose between someone who was. More big and hairy. Versus somebody who's a lot less big and hairy, but more pale. Which. Which way are you leaning towards there? Like, muscly big?. Yeah. Muscly big. Well, that's generous. Oh, they're in there somewhere. And I like hairy versus, like, groomed or manscaped. But how hairy? I could grow a beard. No, you can't. Can, too. Cannot. Can, too. Can, too! Cannot. Well, I can always shaves my beard, easypeasy. Or evens get a haircut. Let's take about 80% off her over there, Squirrelly Dan. Yeah, sure. Hey, look, bubbles! Bonnie, what are you looking for in a relationship? I kinda like being single right now. Humor me. I don't know. I've never really been in love. Okay, let's get this ball rolling. Wayne. Rosie. What's the key to making this look so good?  Space. Like, distance? Not distance. Although distance makes the heart grow fonder. Just space. Space. So you don't wanna get like. Sick of each other. Example. I like to read, a lot. I like to stay in and read. It's not easy telling a guy you don't want to see him because you want to stay in and read. Let's test this theory. Dary. Say you asked Bonnie McMurray out on a date and she says. I'm going to stay in and read. She up to somethin'. Dan? Oh, she's definitely up to something. Wayne? Must be a pretty good book. Must be like. The Road. Uh, no. Still suspicious of that. Yeah, wouldn't that make you. Wary? No reason not to trust her 'til she gives you one, bud. You know, Bonnie, I had my first girl phase around your age. Let's see it, bud. Is something weird going on there, bud? Boom! $20 fine! Fisky. What? What? Oh, I don't know what kind of pretyke, subamateur hour Teenage Mutant Ninja fucking Turtles organizations you guys have played for in the past, but don't step on the logo is straight fuckin'. It's basic. Don't step on the logo. Live for the logo, respect the logo! Fisky. Then why is it on the floor? That brings me to my next point. Your jerseys. Oh, yo, buddy. You should call it a sweater, buddy. Don Cherry's orders. Don Cherry, buddy. Your sweater never ever touches the floor. Hang up the sweater. Live for the sweater. Respect the sweater. Mmm. Boomtown! You're not off the hook, bud. Do you want us to trust you? Do you want this team to come together? You want a fuckin' W? Yeah! Then we're gonna need to see your junk, buddy. Let's see your junk, buddy. Mmmhmm. You know what? Team exercise? Team exercise. Yeah. Yeah. All right, boys, everybody up. Trousers down, junks out, boys. Lets help a teammate. Junks out, boys.  Is. Someone on the ice, bud? That's our ice, buddy. Hey, don't move, pheasants. So, Bonnie, what has a guy have do to get your attention? I don't know. Make me laugh, I guess. Turn off the bubbles. Hey, Bonnie, have you ever seen It Came from Beneath the Sea? No.  You have now. That was well brought up, too bad you weren't.  Dary actually stole my joke there. But lucky's for you, Bonnies, I'm very funny's and I have lots of jokes. Okay. Hey, Bonnies, what's another word for champagne? Um. Oh, bubbly. If you say so.  You've got a rich inner life. You're funny, Katy. That was funny, Dan. It was almost as funny as the first time that I heard it. Youse shouldn't fart in front of girls. That was my joke, Dan. You stole my joke, didn't you? Don't you interrupt me. I swear I will. Stop.  Stop it, right now! I. Just quit it. Okay, enough! Please. And thank you. You're not so funny, are you now, Dary? How's that book comin' along? I miss that book. Did you hear they're still searching for the Loch Ness monster?. And she's migrated. Ooh. Funny, I thought these were Ogopogo waters. Guess they are. Don't make me come over there, Dan, because I. If you do that one more time. Just. Wink at me again, I. Daniel!. Daniel, stop your fartin' and telling your jokes! Are those jets on autotimer, Bonnie? Nope. Did you press the button again, Katy? Hard no. Over and out. Who's that? What's that? Tanis. What's a Tanis? Well, aren't you a little bundle of sass. You better watch your little tongue before I flick you with my womanhood. Did your balls drop finally, Skiddo? Feel a little fur on your nut sack? 'Cause that is the only logic I can think of behind why you chodes would terrorize this whole town knowing that Wayne would think it was us. Although I am a selfadmitted glutton for punishment. It never crossed my mind. I will wipe that smirk off your face like pixie dust over there wipes your little asshole. It was just once! I.  Hey! No, you were passed out.  I was. I said stop it! I was just trying to help. All right, I need to get to the bottom of this first. What, do you, like, hang out with these losers? Which losers? Peter Pan and Tinker Bell. They're giving you drugs, aren't they? What makes them losers? Trust me, tart. You don't want me to answer that. Tart? That's what I said. Tart. Intriguing. What is? Well, the psychology at work here. Yeah, fuckin' right. It's called intimidation. No, it isn't. It's called projection. Okay, it didn't take me very long to realize I don't like you. My mother's a psychologist.  'Kay. You harbor guilt over your promiscuous impulses so you can call me a tart. That's projection of the sexual feelings you're attempting to hide. Poorly. For who? For Stewart. You like Stewart? No! And you two. You call my friend Roald here, Tinker Bell and pixie dust because you're uncomfortable with your own sexualities. His open homosexuality makes you feel even more uncomfortable. That actually kind of makes sense. No, it doesn't! Yours kind of makes sense. No, it doesn't. Let's try an exercise. Hug Roald. See how it makes you feel. You might be surprised. No! No. Roald, help them out. Encourage them. Like. Like, I hug them? A big hug. Can I be in the middle? Ugh! It may be distressing at first, but you owe it to yourselves to try. You could be so happy. Uhhuh. We should try, too, Tanis. Fuck, no. I'm warning you, Skiddo. Whoa! Second warning. All right. Do damage, boys. Let's go! Oui. Alors. Tart. I'll be back. Oh, you're the best, Gae! Artistry. Virtuosity.  An undocked dismantlement of the decrepit. Fuckin', eh. Was all that true? Is your mom really a psychologist?. Yes, she is. And we're going home. Gae? Tyson? Joint Boy. You guys can play? Boys, hockey's 50% mental and 50% being mental. I'm mostly just mental. I'm still not sure that's PC, buddy, but. Bas McRae! Buddy. We've spent the entire season trying to bring the team together. And get W's, buddy. Maybe the entire time. We just needed to add some grit, buddy. A little sandpaper, ferda? Boys, how would you guys like to play for the Letterkenny Irish? How would you boys like to get a fuckin' W? I'm no stud, but I can sure as hell make some room out there for you boys. I'm dog shit. But I can beat the fuck out of 95% of the population on Earth. Wheel, snipe, celly, boys! Follow us. . Nice. What's goin' on here, boys? Is this a hazing ritual? Boomtown!. Mmm. Okay. Modest. Nothing weird going on. No weird jhook, ferda. No mutant, bobblehead turtleneck. No weird long snout anteater. No disfiguration or discoloration, ferda. Healthy. That's modest. Great dick, Boomtown. Boomtown? You've just helped this team come together, buddy. Feel good about that. And these guys are going to help us get that W. If. Boomtown. Is that okay with you? Boomtown? Let's do this, boys!  . Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! Whoa! Put your junk away, boys. We didn't sign up for a sword fight, boys. It's gross. Well. Congratulations, degens. Your jokes just cost us company. Rosie did say she was missing her book. Yeah, she's up to something. She's up to somethings. Regardless. Full transparency, Bonnie. You have a number of interested parties in here. I've gathered that. So. Where do your interests lie? Well, Daryl. No!. No! You're muscly, big. Yeah. That's generous. Kinda. Dan. No!. No! You're hairy, which I like more than groomed or manscaped. And I can always shaves my beard. And Katy. No!. No! You make me laugh. And we haven't even started tickling yet. But. I like being single. No! Because then you can fool around with whoever you want and not get in trouble from anyone. Ah!  What? Oh, I'd be in trouble. I'd be in troubles. I'd be in big trouble. From who? Wayne? Yeah? Thanks for not turning the seat warmers on in your truck. Kinda makes you feel. Like you peed? Yeah. Yeah. That was fun. Yeah. And funny. I didn't want to admit it 'cause there's. Such a thing as an inappropriate. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for a wonderful day. Will you be reading tonight? Yeah. I hope you'll enjoy your book. After we make some dad noises?. Great!You were havin' breakfast with your pals the other day. Fuck were youse drunk last night. You know, I can't stand it when you guys get really, really, really drunk. Wasn't s'bad. It was s'goddamn bad. You get super annoying when you're really, really, really drunk. Right, scary Dary? Please leave me alone. Pushing your nipples against everyone all night? And what about you, madman Dan? Or should I say, Legend of the Wind? It's Squirrelly Dan, Miss Katy. Challenging everyone to a foot race? Get real. Please stop shouting at me, Miss Katy. And let's not skim over Wayne the Pain. Mind your own beeswax, Katy. You have the most annoying fuckin' laugh on planet fuckin' Earth, when you get really, really, really, drunk. Clean it up! There's a new addition to the Squirrelly Dan famdamly. I've seen that in the paper. What's the scoop there, big shooter? Well, Samuel's. I fuckin' hate Samuel. He's a Big Brother's now. Oh, I fuckin' hate Samuel so much. Well, that's interesting, maybe make Samuel straighten up, fly right there. That's what I said. Youse did pot today, didn't ya's. No. 'Cause youse are talkin' like youse did pot. Why? Because that logic is Titanic on the ocean floor busted. Why? Well, it's like when a celebrity gets all fucked up on snooters and such. They think that the solution to sortin' themselves out is to get a puppy. What's wrong with a puppy? Well, I'm just sayin', doesn't it seem more appropriate to sort yourself out before bringing a beating heart into your own home, rather than relying on that beating heart to sort yourself out? Snooters and such. Uh, hmm, I had my go with snooters and such. Small town spawn snooters and such. Degens do snooters and such. Over and out. I'd have to agree. I think it's differents for Samuel's, he's just a sixyearsold with a penchants for mischief. Someone needs to hit that kid. I thinks for a sixyearsold introducing a little brother's into the mix might just be what he needs to inspires him to sort's himself out. I have to agree. It's like Samuel who's introducing a little brother to himself to sort himself out. It's different than like a celebrity introducing a puppy to sort himself out after snooters and such. And my cousin says the baby is very smart. Pump the brakes? I'll soft pump. What's the stupidest thing you ever heard in your life? I would like to say, but it's impolite to talk politics at the breakfast table. I'd also likes to say but it's impolite to talk religions at the breakfast table. Well, mine is neither politics or religion so I will say, the stupidest thing I ever heard in my life, is that a baby is smart. Well, hold your horses there, big shoots. My Aunt Nancy works at the nursery down at the hospitals and she says I was the smartest baby she ever did see. Your Aunt Nancy said that I was destined for constant confusion. Are you saying my Aunt Nancy is stupids for saying such things? I love your Aunt Nancy. I owe her a great deal for my personal growth as a young man. I even call her my Aunt Nancy. Please tell her I said hello. I will, good friend. But what, seesuckin', so to speak, makes a baby smart? Well, she says I was always reachin' out for things in my surroundings. And that made you a smart baby? Allegedly's. Okay, Dan. Okay, okay, Dan. Okay, hold your thumb out. I'm gonna be a baby. Ehya. Now what about that suggests I ought to be buildin' rocket ships for NASA in outer space? Your Aunt Nancy said that a baby who shows signs of excitement before it's able to verbally communicate is a sign of intelligence. Aunt Nancy said signs of stimulation. Well, 'cause that means that they're already getting excited about their surroundings. A baby is stimulated by their surroundings. Okay, Dary, okay. Okay, Dary, yeah, okay. Go wideeyed stick your tongue out. I'm gonna be a baby, okay? I'm gonna show you signs of excitement slash stimulation. No but, Dary, like. Like make the sound like you're doing it to a baby. Ehya. Now what about that suggests that I ought to be navigating unchartered neurological pathways in the brain? I expose nothin'. Yeah, realistically. Furthermore, in the midst of excitement slash stimulation, that razor sharp baby is likely to drop a shit in its pants. Unable to control its own bodily functions but smart as a whip, Dan. Imaginable's, but I wouldn't say likely's. Hmm, it's possible. Okay, Dan, okay. Okay, Dary, Dary, okay. Dan, hold your thumb out. Dary, go wideeyed, stick your tongue out, and coo like you're doing it to a baby. I'm gonna be a baby, okay? Clean it up! You suppose you could make the same argument for a dog, but at least you don't have to wipe a dog's poopy bum, do you? What is this buttfuckery? Had a rowdy crowd in last night, boys. Where the fuck from?. Up country. Degens. Fuck! In degens. Offered 'em sex in exchange for peace. No takers, so it's safe to say they were gay degens. Well, we'll just let you runs with that there, Gailer. Look, we've all had a runin with degens from up country. But we figured out a solution. All you have to do is employ the Ginger and Boots to be your bouncers. Degens won't wanna a whiff of this place. Choice idea, Daryl. Also go ahead and change the name of my bar from MoDean's 2 to Ostrich Fuckers while I'm at it. Crazier things have happened. Besides I'm bringin' in my own bouncer. Oh, is he single? You've had a busy winter, Miss Katy. Get after it. Who's that? My cousin Bradley. Ah, Bradley! I fuckin' love Bradley. I love Bradley so much! I'm one, I'd go as far as to say I love him, too. I love his pecs. Nobody loves Bradley more than Rosie. Like, I'm not really one for, like, being touched or anything like that, but then like, he'll be huggin' you and her huggin' me, it'll be like a little bit different. Like. Well, like it's okay. I'm his secondfavorite cousin. He's always saying, God bless you. And, you know, I'm not really a religious guy's, but when he says it you feel good, like. Like I can feel the warmth. Rosie's his favorite cousin. And he does the best impersonations, too. Like so many of 'em. Like he could do it professionally. He could do me professionally. Hey, can't forget about the lowbones. Oh, youse can's never forget's about the lowbones. I hope this is what I think it is. What's lowbones? Well, lowbones is basically like if somebody's saying something, and you agree with them, that means give them lowbones. You can also use lowbones to say hellos or goodbyes. Do you wanna know what? Here's what lowbones is, I can tell you what lowbones is. Lowbones is when you hold your knuckles below your waist like this and bang knuckles with somebody. Except don't look the person in the eye or in the knuckles when you bang knuckles with them. Almost like you don't give a care. And then you say somethin' positive under your breath upon bangin' of the knuckles. Like, uh, Hell yeah, fuck it. Or, uh. Yeah, man, you rock. Like, everybody get in here for a second. Just pretend, like, I just got here and I'm gonna show you what lowbones are. Hey, everyone, I just got here. You rock. Fuck yeah. Yeah, but 'cept you gotta say it more under your breath than that. Like, everybody get in here, pretend like I'm leaving. Okay, guys, I'm gonna leave now. Something about the best part about Bradley is. But we all know what the best part about Bradley is. Bradley is a fuckin' killer. Oh, like, Bradley will fuckin' kill you. Like, Bradley knows his ways around a headbutts and that's for GD sure. Not sure that's the best part about Bradley. When does Bradley get here? Should be here any second. Well, then we'll all wait here at the bar and greet him. I love Bradley. I love Bradley so much. Do you wanna know what? I'd go as far as to say I love him, too.  . Okay boys, it's the final game of the campaign. Final chance for one W. Sixty hard miles, boys. Fore check, back check, pay check, boys. Now, Joint Boy. Tyson. You guys may be what this team needs to finally come together. You guys might be the final piece. Ferda. We've reserved the two toughest numbers in hockey for you. Joint Boy, you'll be wearing number 28. Domi, Godard, Stock. Three of the toughest players wore number 28. Don't forget Colton Orr. Thanks, boys, it's an honor. Pretend Boogaard wore it. That is a fuckin' honor. Tyson. You'll be wearing the toughest number worn by the toughest allaround player to ever lace 'em up. Number nine. Gordie Howe, boys. Gordie mother fuckin' Howe, boys. Mr. Hockey.  Mr. Elbows. Creator of the Gordie Howe Hat Trick, boys. One geno, one apple, one tilly. Thanks, boys. Greatest all round player in the history of the show, Mr. Hockey. Gretz is the best player in the history of the show. Give your balls a tug. Gretz is the best. We didn't mean any disrespect to 99. We said Gordie Howe was the best allround player. Gretz holds or shares 61 records in the show, you piece of shit. Don't nickel and dime the Great One. But Mr. Hockey. Suck my Mr. Cockey, you fuckin' loser. Hey, hey, hey. There's more important things, like this team coming together. You're right. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, Jonesy. Tell your mom I drained the bank account she set up for me. Top it up so I can get some fuckin' KFC.  Fuckin'. Hey, there's more important things. More important things. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, Jonesy. Your mom loves butt play like I love HaagenDazs. Let's get some fuckin' ice cream.  Boys! We've come a long way. Overcome adversity on our quest to finally come together as a team and get one W. Bulldozed speed bumps, boys. You're right, we've conquered. For example, puck bunnies, you little bitch. Yorkie? Chirping from the bench 101. Scholtzy. Don't step on the logo. Pussy. Fisky. Sweaters never touch the floor. Boomtown. Presenting my penis to my allmale teammates in hopes that they will accept me. And then having my penis called modest, with my allmale team further coming together as a result of seeing my penis. That's the big picture. What? Why do they talk like that? I wasn't finished! Boomtown! Keeping the big picture in mind, and despite all your honest opinions, which I do appreciate, you could have called my penis the big picture. That would have been a thrill. Boomtown. Let's get this fuckin' W boys! It's the last game of the season, pheasants. We'll get this W tonight, or I send one of these sailing with this bad boy on my foot! Think of the destruction! Think of the carnage! Think of the good men left behind.  Toilet was backed up so I had to shit in there, too, titfuckers. I'm gonna get that plug, buddy. We have to do something about that pilon, buddy. How's that for motivation?. Hey, Reilly, I made a oopsy, can you ask your mom to pick up Jonesy's mom on the way over to my place? I double booked them by mistake, you fuckin' loser. That guy's a masterpiece. So, this is. Goodbye? Lyric from the Moby track Porcelain. Roald. (HIGHPITCHED) Stewart. Why don't we call it, adios. Actually, I'd prefer if we don't call it that. Long story, but this girl I kind of used to date used that word when she dumped me, and she broke my heart. Then we'll call it sayonara. Arrivederci, amore. Ciao. Shalom. Auf wiedersehen.  Roaldy. Gae. Roald. Stewart. This is what we've been working towards, remember? We did it.  I. I like you. You, you, you, and I don't want you, to go, oh, oh. Roald. Stewart. Connor. Darien. Hysterics are fruitless. Tears are valueless. Pain. Is inevitable. That's my mom, she's such a twat. Give me three good reasons why you fell you must rebel. I hate the world.  I hate my parents. . And I hate myself. As you were. No, no, no, no! I don't understand!. He's so close I can smell him. I'm about to slide right off this chair, boys. That libido works harder than soldiers stacking sandbags for a flood. That's a Texas size 104, Gailer. First the models. Some talk around town about some business in Bonnie McMurray's hot tub. Even heard something 'bout you and a couple of French dudes. You've had a busy winter, you old goat. I have had a busy winter. But I mean, like French guys, am I right? Hello, hello.  Bradley! Haha! Oh, bless up! I can't believe. I can't believe. I haven't seen y'all in forever. Chris Rock! Daryl, I see you over there.

Props to you and him for getting' this place back on its feet. Thanks, cousin. You know what we say. Our lips to God's ears, right? Well, we don't actually ever say that, just you. But you're a great guy, Bradley. So good to see you guys. Hey, Bradley? What's up? Can you, uh, can you do. Do your Michael Jackson impression for me? Uh, I haven't seen you all in so long. I'm sorry. I get emotional. Tito, get me a tissue. That was actually an Eddie MurphyMichael Jackson hybrid. It was a hybrid. Oh, you're so funny, Bradley. Oh, yes, you smell like sandalwood, Bradley. Seriously. Love. That's what's up, that's what's up. So, got a problem with the degens from up country? Yeah. Always got a problem with degens from up country. Lots of hard work dealing with degens from up country. Degens are a problem in Letterkenny. Yes. Well, not no more. Bradley's in town now. That's what's up.  That's what's up. Seriously, straight up, you guys are offduty for the night. Oh, I need a lifeguard on duty right now, boys. Heard through the grapevine, you guys have been putting in OT with these degens. Double OT. That's what's up.  That's what's up. That's what's up. You've all got the night off. Do you hear me? From this day forth I'm on degen duty for the foreseeable future. Denzel Washington! Well, anything we could do to help, though, Bradley. Oh, we'd loves to help you, Bradley. Seriously, Bradley, anything we can do to help. I want you guys to get out and relax and have a good time. Enjoy yourselves and get really, really, really drunk. Oh, pump the brakes. Hey, I'll soft pump. You sure you know what you're signing up for there, big shooter? I think they've earned it. Little bit. Little bit. Oh, Robert De Niro. Okay, but fair warning. They get super annoying when they're really, really, really drunk. I don't care, man! Gentlemen, you've kept watch of this town for long enough, man. Tonight I want y'all to get out and have some fun, man. And I will accept nothin' less than really, really, really, really, really, really really, really drunk. Get out!  Chris Tucker!. That's what I'm talkin' about. Oh! Well, if it isn't my favorite cousin. Waz up, cousin? Hi, Bradley. Yeah. Hey, Wayne, have you been, uh, taking good care of her, Wayne? Can confirm. All right, God bless, that's what's up. Gail? Who's that? Go over and see for yourself. And where did you come from? Glen? Oh, hi, Katy. Is Wayne here with you? Ooh, there he is, hi, Wayne! I love this, we're twins. Uh, busy winter's over. Is that fuckin' joker wearing number 99, bud? This is our chance to make it up to Gretz, bud. Hey, 99, you fuckin' loser. Are you fuckin' serious nines? How dare you wear that number, you piece of shit! That's the Great One's number, you fuckin' donkey. Think you're Gretzky, you piece of shit? Gretz probably smashed your mom in the '80s, bud. I'll get the white tape out and turn those double nines into double zeros. You're a fucking nobody. Fuckin' serious nines? When's Mess get here, bud, you're fuckin' hilarious. When's McSorley get here, you fuckin' plug. Suck my knob! What a fucking piece of work, right? Piece of shit. The fucking audacity. Look at that fuckin' masterpiece, boys. I'd master that piece, boys. Look at those legs go up and make a complete fuckin' ass out of themselves. I'd wear that out, boys. Holy fuck, would I love to get sticky with her. Stick me right to her, boys. Fuckin' Shoresy, buddy, I'm ready to pop. Already starting to snapcrackle, buddy. We gotta get focused, buddy. W's. Who brought the fuckin' rocket, boys? Those billet sister's a fuckin' rocket boy. But she looks cold. I'll show her my warm front. Hey, you look mad. I'll give you a bone to pick. Wait a second. Tyson, make some room for us on the bench. Joint Boy. Beat the shit outta that guy. Give your balls a tug, you tit. That experiment worked wonderfully, buddy. Worth their weight in gold, buddy. Whew! I'm right on the edge, bud, but gotta stay focused. I'm ready for a tilly, buddy. W's. W's. W's. Who brought the fuckin' rocket, boys? Who's billet sister's a fuckin' rocket, boys? Yup! Yup. Yup. Yup. Oh, that was awesome, Bradley. Know what, Bradley? We should totally have a race. You know what they used to call me in high school? Wheels. Bradley, do Bill Cosby. I would like to talk to you about Pudding Pops. All right, that's enough. You're so funny, Bradley. Look how fast he goes. Why don't you guys go play some Buckhunter. I'll race you over to the Buckhunter machine. I'll surprise you. How does that sound? Anyone else feeling. .wayward? (HIGHPITCHED) Stewart. Lacking? Stewart. Mislaid?. Stew. Stewart don't. We mustn't marinate in our own misery and misfortune. We mustn't bask in our own bad luck and bitterness. We mustn't soak in our own suffering and sorrow. Gae wouldn't have wanted that. But. What would Gae do? WWGD. Yeah. Gae would do one more. One more rampage. One final flaunt for fuck you. Roald. Are you in? In, Stewart. Connor, are you in? Darien? Are you in? Wondrous! Roald?. Stewart. How cold is it?. I'll check it out. It's minus 24. Bummer.  Stewart. This is a fool's errand. What? Wasted labor. Thwarted? Pointless. It's really cold. It wouldn't be any fun without Gae anyway. She was an invigorment. What do we do now? What we always do, Roald. Copious amounts of hard drugs.  That was fuckin' epic, boys! I can't believe they called the game, boys! Zerozero for the good guys, boys! I'll take a good fight over a W any day, you little bitch! Yorkie. Lay beats, fill seats. Scholtzy. A good brawl brings a team together. Makes us one, pussy. Fisky. Proof we'd go to the wall for each other, boys. That's brotherhood! Boomtown! Showing you all my penis was degrading and humiliating. Had I known I could have just tossed the mitts to bring the team together, I would have chosen that route. You're fuckin' weird, bud. Fuck is he a weirdo.  Boomtown. But, the team came together. And that's a fuckin' W, boys! I have never been less embarrassed in all my life. They are fuckin' embarrassing! Jonesy, Reilly. You have a visitor! What? Thanks, boys. For what, KatyKat? For the what, KatyKat? For sticking up for me. Ferda. I want to get back together. But just with one of you. God bless you, man, but you better stop it with that nipple shit. From your lips to God's nips, Bradley. Bradley, do your Chris Tucker again. That's the best one. Wayne, I would but your laugh makes me want to strangle a small motherfuckin' dog!  Hey, Bradley, we should race right now. Really. No Dan, no. What? You gonna race me. You hear the Legend of the Wind? I ain't scared of a goddamn thing! Bradley, do your Denzel Washington again. That's the best one. We'll go fast around the bar, real fast. Bradley do your Will Smith again, that's the best one. You and me Bradley, 50 meter dash. Let's go right now.  Okay, 50 meters too far. I get it. Twentyfive meters. It's not so far.  Hear the wind? That's a wind, knocking on your door, Bradley. Bradley? Wayne? That's Bradley's favorite cousin. Trouble in paradise, shirttucker? Ha! Wayne. Please, no. No one loves Bradley more than Rosie. You were chorin' with your pals the other day. Don't be a fuckin' degen, Dary. What? Well, every time you snot rocket. Or farmer spit. You lick your lips after, and it's fuckin' gross. You act like yous got it all your damn self. I'm not a fuckin' snot licker, that's for GD sure. The last time I checked, nothin' up there that can't hurt me. Incorrect, big shooters. Snots is actually your body's garbage removal system. When you breathe in, your nose hairs collects all sorts of dusts and debris, including bacterias and viruses. That's your body's way of removing them from you. That's what snots is. Dust and debris and viruses and what? Figure it out. You're getting rid of that dust and debris intranasallys and then you just takes it right back in orally. Well, youse can both take it anally, that's all I give a care about. You better settle down over there, or I'm gonna come talk to you. Speaking of taking things anallys. Moving on. I gots a question. Nope. It's of the personal varietys. There's such a thing as too much butt talk, and a fella oughta be fuckin' aware of it. Well, youse guys are my friends. I relys on you for counsel. I gots a problem and I need my friends. If a man asks for help, you help him. Pitterpatter. Youse guys remembers that gal I took to the chip trucks last summer? Fuck's sake. The one who put her finger in your bum? Mind your fuckin' beeswax, Dary. That's the one, Dary. It's impolite to kiss and tell, Dan. Well, I knows it's impolites to kiss and tells, but. No butts. Actually, this involves a significant butt. Hers or yours? I'm gonna take a fuckin' migraine here. Anyways, she was askings me about. Performings the anal sex on her. Youse guys. Youse guys ever do that? You ever. Takes the dirt road home? No. No. Well, Professor Tricia from my women's studies group, she says it's quite commons to. Enter through the back door. Uh. Mind you she didn't stress whethers that was naturals. Well, but, like I've been told, that where vagina sex is like a total encasing of the penis, like. Like sticking a hot dog inside a pogo, and then like, anal sex is a partial encasing of the penis, so it'd be more like putting a hot dog in a beer bottle. Waynes? No. Dary? The answer's still no. But I have been told the same thing as Dary, that whereas vagina sex provides stimulation of the entire penis, like a sausage inside a burrito, but bum sex provides stimulation only from like. Well, like the rim of the butt hole rather than inside the butt hole also. So, what you're sayings is, it's less like going inside this Long John Silvers here, and more like going inside this honey cruller here. Correct. It's less like going inside this loaf of bread. And more like going inside this bagel. Waynes? No. Dary? Answer's still no. But I have been told that it's less like going inside this wheel of Brie cheese and more like going inside this piece of Swiss cheese. Oh, I love Swiss cheese. I love honey crullers. You don't like bagels. Nope. I need to borrow your truck, big brother. What for? To take these two back to the city. For good? Yeah. Why youse taking them back to the city, Katy? Why don't you ask them? Okay. Shep. Kingsley, why is Katy's taking you backs to the citys? Probably 'cause we're big fat tubs of lard. It's 'cause we're too tubby. Does that answer your question, Dan? Gotcha. If I was a supporting character in a Tom Hanks movie, I'd be Tubba Gump. Oh, sure, sure. And if youse were an early Jake Gyllenhaal film, you'd be Tubble Boy. If I was a career resurrecting Matthew McConaughey vehicle, I'd be Dallas Buyers Tub. Exactly. And if you were an Original NES twoplayer fighting game, you'd be TubbleDragon. I knew youse were tubble when you walked in. Let's go. Don't forget to come back for the opening of MoDean's 2. Let's get hammered, boys. Those is acceptable terms, Ms. Katy's. 'Bout time we had some sort of bar in this town. Gail called. She says she needs a hand getting set up. Yeah. We gotta go past Jivin' Pete's YouBrewToo to pick up the kegs. Youse can do that without me. Mmm. What's Jivin' to do now? Besides hangin' out with degens from up country? Jivin's not really a goods guy anymore, is he? Mmm, no. I wouldn't call Jivin' a good guy anymore. Jivin' honked his horn at Katy when she was crossing the street uptown. Jivin' shouldn't have done that. Jivin' laughed at her, too, when she jumped. He scared her. To be fair. To be fair. (SINGSONG) To be fair. Jivin's pals laughed, too. Jivin's pals shouldn't have done that. Jivin' and his pals thinks so much of themselves they probably suck each other off. We'll go pick up the kegs from Jivin's. You want us to tell Jivin' you're gonna come talk to him? You know how he feels about talkin's. He'll hear it from me. 104, good buddy. Over and out.  Hey, girl. Hey, boy. Superstar DJ. Hey. Here we go! Who are you? Gae. So am I. I didn't ask what you were, girl. I didn't tell you what I am, boy. Who are you? I'm Gae. So am I. No, you're not. That's exactly what my father said to me. So you're in the business of opening wounds, girl? Stop calling me girl, boy. And what shall I call you? Gae. I'm the only gay in this crew! And I was born this way, Stewart! I support you, remember? Let me get this straight. He's a homosexual? That's exactly what my mother said to me. The exact same way. You will delete yourself from this dwelling, girl. But not before you reveal your motive behind your vexations streak! Fine. And after that, huh, you better bizzounce! My name is Gae. That's your name? Wow. And I thought Roald's parents never gave him a chance. They didn't. My parents banished me to Letterkenny from the city to live with my aunt because of poor behavior. You're an outcast. I'm a deportee. You're a vagrant.  I'm in exile. Arresting. Everyone here is some form of derelict. I will hear you out. Gae. Dad. Yup. Still a homo. But you're the one who named me after the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory! Listen up, you pilons. Grab a knee, plugs. All right. Now, I know you guys may not want to hear this, but getting rid of that puck bunny is the first step towards getting a W, boys. We'll introduce you to a couple of sporty little spices down the road, boys. But I like that sporty little spice. Pardon? Sorry. Sorry, man, my bad. Boomtown! But I like that sporty little spice! Okay. Well, you'd better learn to hate her because she's the reason we have zero W's on the season, boys. We need that W, boys. Gotta have that W, boys. Gotta want that W, boys. And the first step to getting it is. Beating your opponent mentally. Gotta get inside of his head, boys. Hockey is 90% mental, 10% skill. Unless you're a retired NHL tough guy Basil McRae, who says hockey is 50% mental, 50% being mental. Still not sure that's PC, buddy. No. Baz makes his own rules, though, buddy. Love Baz, bro. Baz for life, yo. Now, the easiest way to get inside your opponent's head, boys, is by chirping from the bench. Obviously, boys. Talk is for Schmelts, you little bitch. Do your talking on the scoreboard, schmelts. Oh. Oh, okay. Hmm. Have any of you guys been doing any talking on the scoreboards lately? Hey? Hmm? Nice stats, no stats. Fine, you little bitch. We'll try it your way, schmelts. Good. Tonight, we will be taking you boys through chirping from the bench 101. We can get this W, boys. We will get this W, boys. You're not gonna get this W, boys, not by yourselves. But luckily for you pheasants, someone in this room has got some jam. Ready to meet your new teammate? Come on! Look at this tour de force. This piece de resistance. This masterpiece. Huh?  Look at that hustle. Look at that jam. Multitasking, pheasants. Maxing every single second! That's how you get the W, boys. Well, fuck, boys, I was already down here ripping ass whilst figured I'd rip some raps. What the fuck are you looking at, tit fucker? Give your balls a tug. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, Reily. Fight me, see what happens. Yeah, what's gonna happen, Shoresy? Three things, I hit you, you hit the pavement, ambulance hits 60. That's the worst chirp I've ever heard in my entire life, Shoresy. That's my slowlearning Mennonite uncle's favorite chirp. Yeah, it's your mom's favorite chirp, too, buddy. Ask her, see what happens. Yeah? What's gonna happen, Shoresy? Three things, I hit you, you hit the pavement, I fuck your mom again. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, Jonesy. Your mom just liked my Instagram post from two years ago in Puerto Vallarta. Tell her I'll put my swim trunks on for her anytime she likes. Fuck you, Shoresy! Fuck you, Reilly. Your mom keeps trying to slip a finger in my bum, but I keep telling her I only let Jonsey's mom do that, you fuckin' loser. My mom would never put a finger in your bum! Mum's a fuckin' saint. Fuck! Fuck your entire fuckin' life, you piece of shit. Gail, how're ya now? Good, 'an you? Not bad. To MoDean's 2! Ah. It's a hell of a space you got. Thanks for the help, boys. You're welcome, Gails. Wasn't Jivin' Pete supposed to deliver those himself? Yeah. What happened with that? My cousin said she seen him with some degens from up country. Anywho, Old Gail's all sorts of jazzed about MoDean's 2. So are we, Gails. I'm so jazzed I couldn't sleep last night. I was up flickin' more bean than a Starbucks barista. Good enough, Gail. I mean it. Handled more dime than a homeless man. Where do these go? Back door. Where you know you're always welcome, Wayne. Okay.  There someone else here? Yeah. I hired a couple waitresses. Oh. Bonnie McMurray. I thought you said there was two, uh, waitresses. Glen? Wayne!. Well, I guess the kitten's out of the clutch, again. Glen's back to waitressing. Well, you look. Ordinary.  Did you hear that? That's some hot praise coming from Mr. Extraordinary. Gave him a little makeover. Figured if you guys get some eye candy, old Gail is gonna help herself to a fistful too. Mmm. Gail got me the Lasik so. Hi, Bonnie. Hi, Wayne. How're ya now? Bonnie, kegs are coming in, so make sure the lines are clean. Glen, go throw some ice in the urinals. I know it's like a little video game for you guys. Can confirm. Bye, Bonnie. Bye, Wayne. No, I was going to say it first. You don't want to go toetotoe with me, darlin'. Anyway, back to Jivin'. He's turned into a bit of a tit, hasn't he? Yeah, his pals too. Well, if you've got something to say about Jivin', you should say it to his face. Bad gas travels fast in a small town. You don't want him hearin' that from somebody else. It's dishonorable. It's a true story. Saddle up to the bar when you're done. I'll show my new Haitian taco. Well, I don't know if that's foods or not, but if it is, I'm lookin' forward to it. It's only for Wayne. Well, then I guess it's not foods. But I'm gonna pencil you in for a chats, Gail, 'cause Haitian tacos, that sounds like we got something there. You guys remember when Jivin was pissing down the hay mow and Alexander was climbing up and he got a bit of pee in his mouth? Enough talk about Jivin'. And then, you remember the same night Alexander fell face first into the cow paddy and got a bit of poop up nose? That's pretty much par for the course with Alexanders. So, what would you rather have then, a bit of pee in your mouth or a bit of poop up your nose? Well. Well, fuckin' neither. Well, but it's hypothetical, it's a game. It's called, Would You Rather. So, you got to pick one or the other is what you're saying. Yes. It's hypothetical. Kinda feels like you did pot. Well, how much pee's are we talking about? Yeah, and how much poop? Okay, so if we're talking about, like an eyedropper, be like, mmm. Four or five drops of pee, right in your mouth. Or, let's call it like, the end of the pinkie fingernail, full poop, up your nose. For the rest of your life. Oh, so it's for the rest of your fuckin' life now? Yeah. Would you rather have a bit of pee in your mouth, or a bit of poop up nose? And you. You can't spits the pee's out your mouth or blows the poops out of your nose? Well, see, Dary would just lick it off his lips after blowin' it out anyway. That's correct, Dan. I think I'd take the poops in my nose. But then you'd be smelling poop for the rest of your life. And poop is potent, pal. Yeah, but if you had pee's in your mouth and every time you takes a bites of food, you. You're gonna be tasting pee's. Yeah. And you're gonna have to swallow a bit of that pee with every time you take a bite of food. Do you wanna know what, I'd take the poop. Yes, I would take the poop. Well, there's no chance of ingesting's the poop? Well, I'm not a scientist or anything, that's not really my forte, but say you had the sniffles, right? And you honk one back, and you get a piece of that poop right in the back of your throat, that's down the hatch. Well, see that's changing the fuckin' rules, Dary. Before you said you're either taste the pee or smell the poop. Now you're saying you're tasting and smelling poop. Well, the pee is in your mouth and the poop is in your nose. What happens after that is beyond my control. Well, he's right there, Wayne. So? 'Kay, just. 'Kay, you wanna know what. 'Kay, let's all answer at the exact same time. And a one and a two and a one, two, three.  Poop. Pee. What the fuck was that shit? That is shameful, Dary. That is. Shame on you. Know what? I'd have a fuckin' spit! Now before we proceed, dost thou knoweth where Devon is? Who? Devon. No. No. Yes. Yes? No!  You appear. Felonious. You appear erroneous. How are we to know that you are not responsible for Devon's disappearance? I don't know, how are you? Still a little hurt and fragile from speaking with my father. But thank you for asking. That's not what she's saying, Roald.  What are you saying, Stewart? I'm just saying, as Devon fades, you materialize. Simple math. Child's play. Cool movie. Though I prefer Problem Child. Same. What's with the clown costume? Sit. Stay. Speak. What's with the clown costume? Don't you watch the news? There are clowns inflicting apprehension on the general public via sheer terrorism, or petty vandalism all over North America. So, you've coalesced with some sort of continental, intercolonial clown posse? I'm a bad seed. Staying out late, missing curfew, you know. I know. Kissing boys.  Hmm. I know. What is it you seek, Gae? Asylum. Remember Soul Asylum? Cool band. Though I prefer Soulfly. Same. Collective Soul? Or Soulwax. Wondrous. soulDecision? Asylum granted! Domo. Arigato. I'm here to rebel. Give me three good reasons why you feel you must rebel. I hate the world. I hate my parents. I hate myself. As you were. My parents banished me here for poor behavior. It is my goal to behave even worse in Letterkenny, so they have no choice but to bring me back. Formidable. Jocular. Allow us to assist. To aid. To be your asset. Oui. C'est bon. Prodigious. First rate. Boss. Incroyable. Hooray. But first. Our wardrobe craves alteration. What. What does that.   Okay, boys let's keep it simple, ferda. KISF principle, buddy. Keep it simple, ferda. Repetition is the key. Pick a topic. Beat the shit out of it, ferda. Topic is ugly.. The tip of the tongue, the teeth and lips. The tip of the tongue, the teeth and lips. The tip of the tongue, the teeth and lips. Fuck, are you ugly, 22. You're fuckin' ugly, 2's. Your ugly requires a sign, 22. Caution. Fuckin' ugly. Your ugly requires a disclaimer, 22. Parental Advisory. Explicit ugly. You're up. Hey. Ugly. You little bitch. Yorkie. Look at you, ugly. Scholtzy. You're ugly. Pussy. Fisky. Wow. Ugly. Boomtown! Oh, man. Ugly. Keep practicing, boys. Dig deep. Bare down, boys. That was a pisspoor start, buddy. Delicious pun, buddy, since we're pissing. That was ugly.  Well, you gotta work through adversity, find a way to win. Fore check. Back check. Pay check, buddy. Cross check. Hip check. Stick check? No, waving your stick's a free ticket to sit. Hate sittin', buddy. The boys'll figure it out in no time. The boys'll get the mental W, we'll get the scoreboard W. Ferda. Ferda.  . What are you pissing so close to the urinals for, you piece of shit? This is how a real man rocks a piss. Give your balls a tug, tit fucker. I'm coming, Shoresy! I heard the same thing from your mum last night five to seven times. And that's not even my record, you fuckin' loser. What the fuck, man! Sorry you had to do this, fellas. Jivin' Pete was supposed to be around with the sidewalk plow. Jivin's full of shits. Yeah, him and his pals are probably suckin' each other off right now. What did I say? Bad gas travels fast in a small town. You don't want him hearin' this from somebody else. It's dishonorable. Okay. Would you rather have a penis for a nose, or a vagina for a mouth? Hand me another horn 100% of the time. .all the time. Well, can you use them as functioning sex organs or are they just sorts of there? Mmm. No, they are not functional, so you can't have an orgasm through 'em and you can't take a piss through 'em. So then you're eatin' from a vagina mouth or sniffin' through a penis nose? Correct. All this vagina eating talk is getting this old goat all sorts of fired up, Wayne. Fair warning. 'Kay. I think I'd just have to say the vagina's mouth. It's just less intrusives. Well, it's gotta be the vagina mouth. Who wants a dink hangin' down bouncing off their lips all fuckin' day? Mmm. You're just walking me right into it at this point, cowboy. 'Kay. Let's. 'Kay, you know what? 'Kay. Let's all answer at the same time. And a one, and a two, and a one, two, three. Vagina mouth. Penis nose. Oh, that's fuckin' gross, Dan. That's fuckin' disgusting, Dan. Walking around with a mouthful of roast beef all day. Youse have never had a dick bouncing off your lips. Don't knock it till you've tried it. Fuck's sake. From this moment forward, we are a collective. A confab. A conclave. A clambake.  We are. FAKU. Freaks Acting Krayzee. United. Roald. Have you prepared the final accessory? FAKU! One gino tonight, but no W, ferda. One gino too, ferda, but no W tonight, boys. Gotta focus on the small victories, boys. Size matters, bro. All right boys, two seconds left. Let's show us what you got. Remember what we taught you, boys. Talk is for schmelts, you little bitch. We ain't schmelts. Schmelts. Okay, boys, we're running out of time on the scoreboard to do any talking. Try it our way, boys. Pick a topic. Beat the shit out of it. Yorkie? Topic is skate! Scholtzy. Fuckin' skate, 27. Pussy. Fisky. Skate, you fuckin' pylon. Boomtown! Come on, you fuckin' plug, skate! All right boys, now add a little English on it. Add a little hot sauce, boys. Add a little habanero pepper, ferda. Add a little ghost pepper, ferda! Come on, 27, you fuckin' sea salt sprinkling sally, skate! Yorkie? You think you're Chuck Galchenyuk? Nice microns, you fuckin' hipster dandy. Skate! Scholtzy. Skate! Pussy! Fisky. What's wrong with you, you fuckin' cement boot, no legs, cupcake cocksman? Skate! Boomtown! I hate you like I hate puck bunnies, bitch. Skate!   Oh! Yeah, fuckin' loved that move when I was in the third grade. What else can you do, you ugly fuck? Can you suck my knob? You're a knob sucker, 27.     Whoo!. Would you guys rather be surrounded by three bed bugs every night of your life, or three mosquitoes every day of your life?. You're an idiot, Daryl. Are you allowed to kill the bed bugs or the skeeters? No. So, they're immortal bed bugs or skeeters? Would you rather be surrounded by three bed bugs every night of your life, or three mosquitoes every day of your life? No ostrich fuckers here, hicks. I hear you're going around town saying I'm full of shit. Jivin' Pete.  Bad gas travels fast in a small town. Yes, I did say that. And that my friends and I are so into ourselves we probably suck each other off? Yes, I did say that too. Would you say it to my face? I'm embarrassed this got to you before you heard it from me. You should be. I'm not the type of prick to take the side door. I'll come right up front and knock. Good. Knockknock. Who's. You're at Jivin' Pete's. I think you're full of shit and you and your pals think so much of yourselves you probably suck each other off. JIVIN'. Are you fuckin' serious? What's anybody gonna do about it? Say you're sorry. JIVIN'. I'm sorry. Don't honk at girls, and don't holler at girls. And don't talk to them when they're not interested in talking to you. And don't talk to 'em unless they're interested in talking to you. 104? Over and out. You're packing up for a fishin' trip with your pals the other day. I loves fishin' in Kweebec. Who doesn't love fishing in Kaybec? Great fishin' in Kyubec. I fucking hate Quebec. This guy's fuckin' Puppers. Oh, I'm havin' flash snacks. To what? To last time we went fishing. On the ride home, I had to sit in between a family size of Salt'n Vinnies and a party pack of Dill Picklers. Admittedly, last time, things got a little out of whack, when it comes to the snacks. We deserve the flak, but now we're back on track. We have a new plan of attack. Everything we pack has to fit in this sack. We made a snack pact. All these have to start with the letter C, in fact. A, stop rhyming. B, why C? Well, we trieds A. Apples. And we trieds B. Bananas. But C gave us many choice options. Cookies. Crackers. Cheese. Chocolates. See? And then we're on to D, and so forth.  Mmm. Love the D. Pardon? Why does jerky get to come? It's Caribou jerky. What about the nuts? Corn nuts. And the beer?  Cold beer. There's too much choice in the world. How do you fig, Newton? Well, look at toothpaste. It used to be just Colgate or Crest. Now there's like 20 kinds of each. Whitening. Brightening. Enlightening. Goddamn right'ning. It's goddamn frightening. Nice work, double D's. Oh, speaking of double D's, Mrs. McMurray went to the casino with her pals the other night, so McMurray and I went to the rippers. When the cat's away, the mice will play. Where was my invite? Get this, one of the stripper's names. Tell us on the road. Let's go fishin'. I loves fishin' in Kweebec. Who doesn't love fishing in Kaybec? Great fishin' in Kyubec. I fuckin' hate Quebec. Get this guy a fuckin' Puppers. I'll get myself a Puppers. It's nice to have a break from you guys naming your own burps. On the way homes, we'll be spelling our own farts. Hey, you pretty near need consonants for that. I's and T's, and some P's. That's maybe smart. Anywho, about the rippers. Oh, tell us when you get there. There's lots of time for telling stories when you go fishin'. I loves goin' fishings in Kweebec. Who doesn't love fishing in Kaybec? It's great fishin' in Kyubec. I fuckin' hate Quebec. Get this guy a fuckin' Puppers. And everybody else in it, too. What's the problem, poopypants? Well, for one thing, you can never tell what the hell they're sayin' half the time, that's for one thing. Ignorance is bliss, bud. Yeah, they should figures it out. Maybe you should figure it out. Okay, you try to name me one good guy that's a French guy. You try to name it. Go ahead and try. I bet Corey Hart's a pretty good guy. I'm not sure that he's a French guy. You'd trust somebody's who wears sunglasses at night?. Name me another French guy that's a good guy. Go ahead and try. Well, what's about that guy from the alien show? 3rd Rock from the Sun? That's the one. John Lithgow? Nope. French Stewart? Yeah, that's the one. He's not French. Well, his name is French. That guy squints too much. Well, they can take a walk, the whole lot of 'em. Dary, I think there's something much deeper at play here. Can confirm. What's the story? All right, well, so this one time. Oh, tell us when we get there. There's lots of time for tellin' stories when you're goin' fishin'. Great day for sleighin', huh, Dan? It's a toboggan. So, Dary, what's the story? Which one? I'd hear the ripper story now. Well, I'd hear why you hate French people so much. Doesn't hate 'em. He loves 'em, that's the problem. No, I don't. Do too. No, I do not. Yeah, you do. You love French gals but hate that they don't love you. Dary, please explain. Well, every time there's a French gal I kinda like, I have a real hard time explaining to her that I kinda like her 'cause she only speaks French. And I'm not a good enough lookin' dude to get by on just my looks. Aw, Dary. Give this guy a fuckin' Puppers. And, if there's like, an English gal I kinda like but there's a French dude around, you know she's goin' home with the French dude 'cause the English gals love French dudes. Can confirm. And English dudes love French gals. Can confirm. That's why they can take a walk, the whole lot of 'em. All right, well let's hear the ripper story, then. Yeah. Oh. Okay. Okay, so me and McMurray went to the rippers the other night, and there was this stripper and her name was. Allanus Morissette. I loves it when they do variations on real people's names. Like, uh, Avril Vagine. Nelly Furtaco. Alec Baldwang.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, but, but. Allanus Morrisette. Sm'ellen Degenitals. Oh, Meryl Strip. Hannibal Lickedher. Dongie Darko. Count Dracuload. Oh, that's a fun one, too, 'cause it lends itself to good costumes. And that's just so camp. Yeah, yeah, but no, no, but. Allanus Morrisette.   Okay, guys.    Who's that? The French.   Boys. Boys. What is that, you little bitch? What's the red stuff, schmelts? Shred the red, boys. Shred the red, boys. Less meals, all wheels. Protein powder program. Meal suppies. Meal scheddie looks like this, boys. Breakfast, Shreddies. Lunch, shreddie the reddies. Dinner, spaghettis. Shit. Only thing about shredding the red is a few more trips to the shit shed, boys. A few more trips to brown town, buddy.  Table for one at the Pooza Hut.  Gotta let the jerseys out of the barn, bro. You'll be Russian to a state visit with Splatamir Pootin. Drown a few brown snakes, bro. Couple of King Cobra coilers, boys. King Kong coilers, boys. Fuck my entire fuckin' life, if you titfuckers light a match in here, the whole fuckin' barn's goin' up. Give your balls a tug. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, Reilly. Fight me, see what happens.  Yeah? What's gonna happen, Shoresy? Three things, I hit you, you hit the pavement, I jerk off on your driver's side door handle. Fuck you, Shoresy. Fuck you, Jonesy. Tell your mom to top up the cell phone she bought me so I can FaceTime her late night. I don't think we can trust her. Pourquoi, Roald? She's got that look. What? You know when somebody comes to your party and does all your drugs, then tells everybody that you're the drug addict? Sit. Stay! FAKU's mission moving forward is hereby labeled, Operation Gae. Objective? Find a way to get Gae back to the city, as per her wishes. Danke schoen. Danke stop, you're not even German. Danke shut your mouth, Roald.  Modus operandi, create mailbox mayhem. Our Operation Gae HQ is here. During the last gasp of daylight, we will skulk into our various positions here, here, here, and here. Then upon clown sundown, we will wreak havoc all over town. We'll deposit the contraband in my trunk and we will dump our load. Here. In the Dollar Store parking lot. To clarify, you want to steal mailboxes? Affirmative. That's a federal crime.   Are you scared? No.  Ooh! Oh! Ooh, ooh. Best of all, Wayne et al., will assume the destruction was caused by Tanis and her crew again. It's perfect. Hey, maybe could urinate in the mailboxes too, you know. To underline how pissed off we are. Roald! You're in FAKU now. It's serious. You're in. Or you're out. I acquiesce. We are FAKU. Freaks Acting Krazee United! Give me three good reasons why you feel you must rebel. I hate the world. I hate my parents. I hate myself. I hate they. FAKU!. FAKU! Not only are they gal hoggers, they're louder than a bunch of. Goat. Goddamn stranded seals over there. Get this guy a fuckin' Puppers. I got a Puppers right there. Hey! Didn't they teach you how to pipe down in CEGEP?   Hey! He said simmers down, so simmers down! Why don't you go eat some tartars, you snails suckin' mime lovers? Uh. I don't know what the fuck you're saying, but turn that shit down! I would rather have Celine Dion. What do they say about arguing with idiots? They'll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience. Over and out. I can be helpful here, fellas. No we. We got this. We got this. I still don't know what the fuck you're saying, but you're saying it now in a hostile tone. And youse don't speak to us in a hostile tone. I still don't know what the fuck you're saying, but other than Georges StPierre, every Frenchman is a fuckin' pussy! So youse better simmer down and I mean right now! Well, why don't you go to a poutine festival in the Thetford Mines? Why don't you go canoe in the three rivers, you inbred fur traders? Go eat a Nanaimo Bar in Kamloops. I fuckin' know what that means. I love Nanaimo Bars. 'Cause you do pot. Yeah. Then why don't you go savagely force feed a duck and then enjoy your foie gras in a sugar shack, Trudeau? Why don't you go snowshoe into the Bell Centre to watch backtoback soldout Simple Plan shows, then go eat some Montreal smoked meat, you bagelmunching, rope pissers? Anik!. Pfft. Pfft. Pfft. Pfft. Pfft. Pfft.   Pfft. No, you're a cock on a vine! You know what, Dan? Sit down. You know, this one's off the beaten path a wee bit, but do you ever notice how French people go pfft at the end of a sentence? Yeah. Yeah, I noticed that. French people do that all the time. They end a sentence and they go pfft. I don't knows if I follows. Well, like if you were an English person going pfft at the end of a sentence, like French people go pfft at the end of the sentence, the sentence would probably be something like, You get so drunk some nights you piss the bed, but other nights you get so stoned you can't piss at all, so pfft. Yeah, or like your guy says, Sex isn't good anymore. And you're like, Well, how do you think I feel? All you put into it is your dick, pfft. You wanna know what's kind of fun to make fun of 'em for? Is if right after they go pfft, you go. Do that again.  So like, You like having casual sex 'cause he gives you some good, but at the end of the day, he doesn't give you a God damn, so, pfft.  Pfft. Pfft! Pfft.  And you know what else? None of youse knows where to put the S's in your God damn sentences. So why don't you go get tricked by a Just For Laughs Gags before you have to hold a referendum to separate my foot from your ass! Choice words, super chief.   Now that was a big turd, period, brother. You gotta have a big turd, buddy. Sniped a penalty shit, bro. Finally got the pooer play clickin', bro. Almost had to foreshit the game. Too many poominute penalties. So what? You boys ready to shred the red? Shreddy the reddy, boys. Try it for praccy. Not sure I want a trouser brownie, you little bitch. Yorkie? Not sure I'm up for smuggling FudgeeOs either, Barts. Scholtzy. Not sure I'm up for squishy poopies. If it ain't yumsies in my tumsies, my poopies go squishies. Pussy. Fisky. I've been stocking nut like Bulk Barn. Boomtown! In. That's what I fuckin' love about you, Boomtown. Love the jam, Boomtown. Love it! Shred the red!. Shred the red. Shred the red!. Shred the red! Shred the red!. Shred the red!. Shred the red! Shred the red!. Shred the red! Shred the red! She is hot. I'm pretty sure the French word for hot is chaud. I'd like to chaud her something. Why don't you invite her to the chaise lounge, Dary? I would. Except I wouldn't be able to understand what she's saying half the time. And I'm not a good enough looking guy to get by on just my looks. Aw, Dary. Cheer up, Dary. Despite those frogs, whose wives can't even take their last names. I'm pretty sure they don't use middle names over there either. No middle names? It's 2015. No, it's not. I loves fishin' in Kweebec. Who doesn't love fishing in Kaybec? It's great fishin in Kyubec. I fuckin' hate Quebec. Get this guy a fuckin' Puppers. Pfft! Pfft!  Pfft!  Pfft!  Well, I guess everybody understands body language. Anik is gone forever. Aw, next time, you'll know to strike while the iron's hot, big shooter. I just can't catch a break. Oh, you got one.  Oh. Hey. Eh? Oh, bother. Oh! Too hot. I've had a hearty, boys.  Mudslide, budski. Oh, no. I've shit my pants.  You little bitch. Yorkie. I've cranked an eightball in my sportsshorts. Scholtzy?   Peak behind door number two to see my little poop de Ville. It's my little deuce poop. Pussy. Fisky. I've had a blumpy. A grumpy blumpy. Boomtown? I'm ready to get the lead out. I'm ready to. Wait. I shit my pants, too. I'm sorry. This is on you, you little bitch. I'm gonna get you, schmelt! Cops are so dumb. Cops are mushrooms. I'll need you to expound, Gae. What do you do with mushrooms? Are we talking Portobello? Shiitake? Chanterelles? I can cook, you know. You give them shit and keep them in the dark. Roald. Are you afflicted? What are you. Ow! Roald? Give me three reasons why you feel you must rebel. I hate the world. I hate my parents. I hate myself! As you were. FAKU! What a bust. Pretty pedestrian effort, super chieftains. Only fish we caught was the one Cock Cousteau tossed over at us. I fuckin' hate Quebec. Can't catch a break here. Oh, bother. Degens from upcountry. No ostrich fuckers in Quebec, hicks. Well, we are way the fucks outnumbered, bud. It's not how many you win, it's how many you show up for. Is that a No Fear slogan? Likely. Bienvenue au Quebec. Your brother's hot.  Do you speak English? Oui. Yes. Yes. Oui. No problem. Of course.  Bon. Well, it's best to avoid a scrap when you're goin' fishin'. But you hate degens from up country too, huh? Yeah? And where exactly is upcountry Kyubec? Laval. My whole life, I've hated the French. You can't understand what they're saying half the fuckin' time. And I couldn't land one of your beautiful women if my life depended on it. As far as I'm concerned, youse can take a walk, the lot of youse. But then youse had our back today. Yeah. Oui. I loves me fishin' in Kweebec. Who doesn't love fishing in Kaybec? Great fishin' in Kyubec. I fuckin' love Quebec. Hear, hear! Cheers!  Sante! Merci, mes amis. Thank you. I'm Anik. I'm Daryl. I think you're really goodlooking. Um, I was looking at you and I see you look at me so, pfft. You speak English. Pretty much everyone in Quebec does. Wow. Do you like Alanis Morissette? Oui. You were fishing with your pals the other day. Wayne. Dary. You should get yourself fuckin' Puppers. I already got a fuckin' Puppers. I know you're still spittin' about the shack gettin' trashed. But if you don't tuck in that lip, a bird's gonna come over here and poop right on it. What do I say about talkin' too much, Dary? The less you say now, the less you have to apologize for later. Good. All I'm saying is, if you're gonna be poopy, maybe go try fishing with somebody else. What do I say about the old boss, Dary? Old boss is always a dick till you meet the new one. Good. Plus, I think, the only other people out here fishing are either Ginger or Boots, who may not have fucked an ostrich like everybody thinks they did. Point and fuckin' proof. You give good advice, Wayne. Well, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. Oh, you're GD right is. Let's just hope she doesn't go in one ear and out the other, bud. Guess what? Chicken butt. That's inappropriate, Dan. Why? Well, you were just out in the great wide open but you wait till you come back in here to drop your guts? Now, just hold your horses, Wayne, for just one second. I farted outside, too. Oh, that is noisy, Dan. Are you fuckin' serious with that turtleneck? Figure it out. You figure it out. Like, that's damn near doctorassisted, Dan. It's a little bit overripe, but it's not like I'm falling aparts on the inside. Do you wanna know what? It's time we draw a line in the sand. Or the snow, so to speak. On farts? On farts! The less you say now, the less you have to apologize for later. Good. But I've had it. Let's get real here. You rip an appropriate fart, we all have a giggle, salute and pay tribute. For a good time, Tim, Tom and Terrence. But the inappropriate farts gotta go. The inappropriate farts are turning us into a bad time Tony, Todd and Tucker. Oh, I can'ts wait. And I mean this. I can't wait to find out what could possibly be deemed an inappropriates fart. Farting in here. In here? With the door closed, yeah. Tight quarters. No airflow. Poor form. But I'm with friends. That's who farts are for. Around food, too. Around food? Especially around people eating food. That's fuckin' ignorant. But I'm eatings, too. That's when I'm rife with farts. Okay, Dan. Dan, okay. Okay, Dan. Dan, okay. Let's do an exercise here. You're in a car, when's it okay to fart? When you're alone. One point for Dary. It's always okay to fart when you're alone, but 'cept when you're in elevators. That's uncouth. You're trying to rob me of my lifebloods here. Or you can roll down the window. Another point for Dary. But the car must be traveling a minimum of 60 kilometers an hour, so that the fart may be aggressively vacuumed out before penetrating nostrils. This is literally all I have going for me. If you ask permission? Hmm. Well, safe to say, if you have to ask for permission it's an inappropriate fart, but I'll still give you a half a point. The cheekiness. The indecencys of it. It's downright abusives, is what it is! Hey. Is that any way to talk to a guy with two and a half points? Get this guy a fuckin' Puppers. You wanna know what? If you needs me, I'm gonna be outsides. Farting appropriately! How cold is it out there tonight? Minus 40 with the wind chill. Old boss is always a dick till you meet the new one. Good. All right, you fuckin' pheasants. All right, you fuckin' pheasants! Coach. Playersonly meeting. I'm so sorry. All right, you fuckin' pheasants. Now, we love being the biggest Pantene pros in the league, but we want some wins. We love being the silkiest studs, but no W's is embarrassing. I mean, I buried a onetimer, a backhandclappertop cheese last night, boys. But who cares? No W. I buried a kneedown halfclapper from the goal line. Big whoop. No W. And if we want some wins in this room, we gotta get the puck bunny out of it. What's a puck bunny, you little bitch? You don't know what a puck bunny is? Not sure I'm familiar with the term either, Barts. Okay. Whereas musicians have groupies, hockey players have puck bunnies. Hmm. Right? Yeah. Right? Get it? I think I understand. A puck bunny is someone who seeks a relationship with hockey players, specifically. Seeks to fuck them. Yes. I have no problem with that. Right. Unless the puck bunny is getting in the way of wins. Any puck bunnies getting in the way of W's come to mind? I once tonguekissed a woman in line for the beer gardens at a dragon boat race, after she said she liked my team jacket. But I don't think she was a puck bunny. You little bitch. Yorkie? I once openmouth firstbased a woman I delivered a gourmet coffee gift card to, after she won at a team fundraiser raffle draw. I don't think she was a puck bunny. Scholtzy? I once got an overthepants handy in the back seat of a Pontiac Bonneville, during a drivein screening of Slap Shot. But I don't think she was a puck bunny. Pussy. Fisky? I once got a rigfriggin' gherkinslurpin' behind a gumball machine at a bubble hockey tournament, but I don't think she was a puck bunny. Boomtown? I once accidentally shit my pants while masturbating in 2010, when Crosby scored an OT to win gold, while I was simultaneously midorgasm. There was no one else there. But don't you think that's a good story? Right, I'm just gonna go ahead and spell this right the fuck out for you, boys. The girl that you're all in love with, she's a puck bunny. You better not be talking about my little Angiebojangles, you little bitch. Yorkie? She's my wittle Angiebopeepers, so sweet when she sleepers, Barts. But still. They better not be talking about her. Scholtzy? Angie gives me butterflies in my wittle bread basketywasket. Pussy. Fisky? It's the little things she does, giving me kisses at night when she thinks I'm asleep, but I'm not. So soopiddywooper cute. Poopiddyboopitywoowoo. Boomtown? No one acknowledged my story from 2010. Maybe I've said too much. I'm feelin' insecure! Barts. Yorkie. Scholtzy. Boomtown. Fisky. Let's get some appys. You're tearing us apart! Hey! We need to talk. Hey, bud. Sick dangles last weekend. Mix in a W, but still. Unreal roadie for the boys. Listen. You too, bud. Silky, silky mitts last weekend. Loved that kneedown halfclapper. Unreal. What did you want to talk about, bud? Nothing. Sicky. What about you, bud? Nothing. Unreal. Well, I'm gonna go crush a sando. Appys a hundy P, boys. Oh, I hate that.  She's speaking puck bunny, bro. Aw, God, girls who don't play hockey should not talk like hockey players, bud. No. Hey! Girls who don't play hockey, stop talking like hockey players. Why would girls think we like that, bud?. We fuckin' hate that! Ah, man, we might be waxed here, bud. I mean, I want W's, but I can't talk to her. I can't do it. I'll fucking pop. I'm with you, bro. I was already starting to snapcrackle. Unless. We find someone who can talk to her. Unless. We find someone who can speak puck bunny. You thinking what I'm thinking? Ferda. Ferda. We gotta move fast, buddy. Smoke bomb. Ninja dust! Well, where were you? Diggin' out your sled. Thanks, big brother. Don't say I never done nothin' for you. Inappropriate. Whys? 'Cause you're not supposed to fart in front of girls. True story. You're suffocatings me. That's a twoway street. Hey, oh! All right. Let's focus on the shack. How we gonna fuck this pig? Step ones. We figure out who dids it. Well, I sent Shep and Kingsley to take photos of the damage in the daylight. Photos? They're on here. Sorry if my big fat thumb was in the way of some of them. Hope so. It'll hide my big fat chunky butt. I fuckin' know these dudes do pot. Guys. If I was part of a religious community of men, I'd be a Tibetan chunk. If I was an Adam Sandler movie, I'd be PunchChunk Love. Like, you know it's more than sugar cereal. Enough. If I was an American rapperDJ, I'd be Chunkmaster Flex. If I was an animated popmusic tribute trio, I'd be Alvin and the ChipChunks. Guys! Go upstairs. Stay there. You've outdone yourself this time, kiddo. Shut up. They are perks. Stimulatings conversations? Well, they're stimulating, all right. Huh? Nothing! Photos. Oh, God. Well, what's the scoop, super chief? Oh, it's degens from up country all right. How do you know? All the different patches of yellow snows. Degens loves pissing outdoors. Fuckin' degens.  Mmm, Dan's right. See that spatter of blood right there? That's from a bloody nose. Degens always got their finger up their nose. I fuckin' hate degens from up country so much. You know, Jivin' Pete's been hanging out with those dudes too. Hmm. Does it feel like we're spending a lot of time dealin' with degens? You know, it does kind of feel like sometimes you just wake up in the morning and start dealing with degens from up country, doesn't it? Only way to handles 'em. We'll find 'em, beat the shit out of them. 104, good buddies. Guys, what did I say? It's just, can we have the photos back? We want to use them for our portfolios. Put a fuckin' shirt on! PitterPatter!   We knocked twice, but nobody answered. Frick and Frack? Come in. Hi, KatyKat. Hey, KatyKat. Pete and Repeat. Hola. You look great. Aw, you trying make this old goat's day? I really like your hair, too. Ticktock. Um, we need a favor. Ferda. Okay. There's a puck bunny. So, the boys are getting laid. A bad kind of puck bunny. So, a lot of the boys are getting laid. She's divided the room. I bet she divides in a room. And we want W's, so. So, she's gotta go.  Yes! Players only meeting. Yeah, we tried that. Boys aren't really receptive. Mmm. She's a clever little bunny. We tried also talking to her too, but. She speaks puck bunny and.  And what? She drives us mental, boys. We can't hang. Like, girls who don't play hockey shouldn't talk like hockey players, boys. We fucking hate that. I should've packed a lunch for this. We need somebody who speaks puck bunny. We were hoping, you could speak puck bunny to her. For us. Ferda W's. Ferda. Okay, I used to speak puck bunny. Forgot most of it. It's kind of one of those languages you need to really immerse yourself in to master. Let's see if I can remember some. Don't judge my accent. Sick mitts, bud. Oh, that's good. Mix in a water. Unreal. That's really good. Wheel snipe, celly, boys. Dirty fuckin' dangles, boys! That's really good. You nailed it. Not my pig, not my farm. Plus, this girl sounds like she rolls. I should meet her one day. Adios. Well, you have met her already though. I have? Yeah, Angie. The Angie?. Yes. In. Look at this mess! Look at all the dirty buttfilled cans. Degenerates. Bet that's not your first dirty butt fill. Inappropriate. Why? Uh, Joint Boy's right in the line of fire there. Somebody likes some Montreal steak spice in their tomato soup. Well, McMurray. How're ya now? Not so bad. That's. I'm good, and. Well. Are we gonna do. Whatever. So, every time. Every time we do this. We're gonna. McMurray! What? Now, no one likes beatin' up degens more than you, so we figured we'd give you a dang. Tyson, Joint Boy, youse helped us put up the shack, so only makes sense you help us defend it. Now, they got us on the weekend. We should nip this in the bud now, before they get the rest of Letterkenny. Well, that's all fine and dandy, Wayne, but I had to hire a hand to do the chores in my absence. You'll have to cover his wages. Same. I'm on nights right now. That's double time. You should try EI. Fuckin' degens from up country. It's costing us money to beat the shit out of these degens. Wells, if we wants to beats the shits out of 'em so bad that they nevers come backs, we're gonna need these guys. You know degens, they always come back. See, they're always coming back, is the thing. PitterPatter. Bought and paid for, for fuck sake. Dary. We're gonna advertise a party for degens, egg huckers, nose pickers, mailbox ruiners. And what we're gonna do is hide in degen blinds, which are very similar to deer blinds. And we are gonna put one right here. And over there, and there, and here. And that way, when the degens come rolling up on their sleds, we jump out of those degen blinds, and beat the shit out of them. Well, that's a good idea, Dary, except it's Tuesday. It sounds more like a Friday night thing, or even a Saturday night thing, or even a Sunday thing if you're squirrelly. Can't forget, of course, thirsty Thursdays. It's fuckin' Tuesday. I'd have a gagger right now. Now, I'm no American sniper style troubleshooter, but I'd say the next step is to discuss a stronger lure to get them out here. Well, whats do degens loves? Well, besides nosepickin', pissin' outside, nothing. Well, there are many things that if you were to watch the evening news, you would stop and say to yourself, What a fuckin' degenerate son of a bitch. I would say at the top of the list would probably be. Racists. God damn right. Racists is definitely degens. That's right, big hoss. Exactly. So, here's what we could do. Now, hear me out, just hear me out. What we could do is we advertise a party for ethnicities out here at the shack. And we could use the ethnicities to lure out the degens that we wants to beat the shits out of. Fuck sakes, that's offsides. Well, you didn't let me finish, Boss Hogg. So, what we could do, okay, is once we bring the ethnicities out here, we could beat up the degens before they could try to beat up the ethnicities. You're still walkin' a super fine line there, big chief. You didn't let me finish. See, what we can do now, is have the ethnicities help us beat up the degens like some kind of fantasy revenge of love of asswhooping. I guess I've seen that in a Quentin Tarantino film one or three times. Abort. There is that one thing you see in the news and immediately think, What a fuckin' degenerate. Well, to be fair. To be fair. To be fair. To be fair. There's more than a couple of things. Homophobists. Yeah. Yeah, no. Homophobes is definitely degens. You mean, like gaybashing. That's the one. That's the worst. Yeah, you're right. That is so gay. Wait, that there is homophobics. Who is? The less you say now, the less you have to apologize for later. Good. You see, Professor Tricia from my women's studies class teaches us that homophobia is not just condemning homosexualitys, but it's also not using the appropriate and preferred terms what homosexuals likes to be called by. Yeah, but they call themselves twinks sometimes. Like, I'd be offended by that. I might be offended by that, too. You see, where I'm from, sometimes when people think things are dumb or stupid, they just say that it's gay. Yeah, but you're not exposed to say that anymore. Are you a homophobes? No. Well, 'cause what you said was definitely homophobics. Fucks this is a lot of work. Hmm. It's like pickin' stones and doin' hay all at once. Fuckin' degens. I'm pretty sure you're a homophobist. I beat the shit out of you one time for beating up a gay. Yeah, I didn't know he was gay. He called me a fag. Well, this certainly has come full circle. Yeah, see, but youse being offendeds at being calleds a fag, is also technically homophobics. I'm gonna take a fuckin' migraine here. Well, see, where I'm from. We all knows where youse comes from, McMurray, but times they are a changin'. I think we can all agree here that homophobists are degenerates. You call the rest a misunderstanding. Call it a fuckin' day here. Ah, you had good intentions. Well, wait, just so I understand here, using gays to lure degens out here is just as bad, if not worse, than using ethnicities to lure degens out here that we wants to beats the shit out of? Christ sake. And Tyson didn't even say that the gays would help us beat up the degens, where the ethnicities would. So, I think it's obvious here, boys, my idea has a clear edge. Mmm, I think it's quite obvious that using human lures is pretty extreme. I'd really likes for you to meet Professor Tricia. Okay, so using gays is homophobic. Tip of the iceberg, bud. What about, fake gays? Well, what's a fake gays? Well, someone who may appear to be gay, but is not actually gay. And therefore, it would not be gaybashing. Well, yes, you'd wanna avoid a hate crime if you could. So, you wants to use fake gays to lures the degens? Perhaps. Okay, listen. Just so long as everyone's heard my messages loud and clears. I thinks I can lives with that. Okay. This has been very diplomatic and rational. I think the next step in the order of business here, would be to go and find some fake gays for these degenerates to beat up. I know where to look. Put a fuckin' shirt on. Barts. Yorkie. Schultzy. Fisky. Katy? Hey, bud. Hey, bud. The boys are supposed to have just dusted praccy. Aw, twoadays. They're on dry land now. Unreal. Hundy P. Been wheelin'? Been turnin' on the jets, yeah. Some notches on the bed post? I've been notching. Hashtag notch or die. Eat. Sleep. Notch. Who? Been making my way up the roster. A full roster? No callups, obviously. Yeah, of course. They're not even schmelts yet. And not Reilly and Jonesy. I'd never touch them. I'd never want to piss you off. About that. Yeah? Do you remember when you cheated on my brother? Yeah. And I went around town telling everyone that I was going to get you? Yeah. But then you left town, so I couldn't. Couldn't what? Get you. Yeah. I guess, I could still. Get you. Yeah. Stay away from this dressing room. Yeah. And all the players in it. Yeah. Especially Reilly and Jonesy. Yeah. And one more thing. Yeah? Open your eyes.  Fuckin' get after it then. Hey, big brother. Good and you? Don't say I never done nothin' for ya. Konnichiwa. You are an embarrassment, Devon. For shame, Devon!. A girl! You know, not to bitch and complain. Not to piss and moan. It's a lot of work, these fuckin' degens, I know. Figures you have to look at the checklist. Advertised for a gay party? We really need some sort of bar in this town. Or homosexual. Or queers. You know, however they choose to be identified. Check. Recruited fake gays. God, those guys are pansies. Check. Tidied up the area in and around the shack to make it look presentable for a fake gay party. Took all goddamn day, but. Check. Constructed degen blinds, so that we may hide out and wait for the degens to try and ambush the fake gay party. Fucks it cold. Check. Paid Tyson and McMurray their wages, so as to help us beat the shit out of the degens. Fuckin' degens. Check. You should really try EI. Right, then we're ready to get this rig rollin'. Not a moment too soon. Here they come. Okay, everybody into their degen blind. When the motion sensor light bulb comes on, time to jump out and beat the shit out of the degens. Thank Christ. 'Cause if there was even one more chore, I mean, even one more chore involved in beating the shit out of degens from up country, I'd be pulling the chute.   Okay, gonna need to replace the light bulb on the motion sensor light. No! Oh, hot Jimmy. My farmhand just texted me and said he's got the scoots, he's gotta go home. Means I gotta go chorin' boys. McMurray, tell him to drop trou' in the gutter like a real man. Be the boss, McMurray. Oh, I don't wanna be a dick. What if he shits himself? Old boss is always a dick till you meet the new one. Good. Shit! Boss needs me to come in. It's an emergency. Yeah, the wheels are falling off here, good buddy. Well, we needs Tyson and McMurray, there's gonna be a baker's dozen sleds coming around the corner, and we are way the fucks outnumbered. Wanna know what? All this work involved in luring these degens out here, all these fuckin' chores. Fuckin' cold. We bring these shirtless nut sacs out here to be fake gay dudes. I'm still not sure how I feel about that. Yeah, there's something wrong. I don't know what it is, or why, but there is. It's not quite sexist, but it's not quite homophobist. It's something though. I know it is. It's not PCs, that's for damn sures. I'm just thinking, all this work luring them out, wouldn't the more efficient thing be to repel them? That's a Texassized 104! I'm farting! Appropriate! Well, I could always stay to just kick the shit out of them just 'cause they're here. And then I have to leave right away, right after, to get back to chorin'. Fuck! Same. EI, boys.  Well, yeah. Like, we're already out here. We're already set up. We'll beat the shit out of them before chorin'. Well, maybe next time we'll just try to repels them. Well, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. Well, what could we put out here that would make sure that nobody ever came out here for anything ever? I know where to look! It had to have been a sick ostrich. All right. After autumn. Ask anyone around the area about accuracy. Arctic activities are abundant, astonishing, astounding and A1 on all accounts. Back up. But before beach bodies, bros better bundle up in boots, blankets, and balaclavas because a bloody, bitter breeze will blow brisk, blustery and bleak. Careful. Correct and common to cocoon in a cap, coat and comforter, because a cutting cold can consume your character, occasionally create a corpse and continually compress your cock. Don't. Don't you dare dawdle, dillydally, or dick around after dark in December, she's definitely damn drafty if you're down a duvet. Easily. Each and every earthling's environmentally enslaved. Fact. It's fucking freezing. It's friggin' frigid. You're fit for flu in February without fleece, flannel, fullfledged furnace, or fire. Go on. It's goddamn glacial, go grab gloves or garb and gear up for gusts. Hear ya. Hypothermia, if you don't heat your home to half hellish it's harsh. Hibernate in a hoodie, hot chocolate, Harry and the Hendersons. Infinitely icy. Inhabit indoors. Isolated and insulated. Incubate the igloo. Illness is an issue. Influenzas implied. Infections imminent. Immunity is impossible. Just joking. Ah, just joshin' jargon. It ain't jail. Jackets in January's no jigsaw. Keep calm. Killjoys keep comfy in their kingdom, crashing kilos of Kleenex, keen for cozy kayaking with their kids when the key is killing kegs with your kin. Literally. Losers live life locked in their layers, lingering lazy and lifeless, lost like legit loners, while the leaders in larger learning let loose. Muff. Earmuffs, mittens and mucus medicine, till mighty maniacal Mother Nature makes milder, mellower, and meltier moves. Motivate your mates, like the Moose Marc Messier. Maybe mix a martini for your maiden, if you've met your match. Nature. Naturally nippy, but that's nothin' new up north. Normal naturistic narrative. Not national news. Overcast. Overcoats and overshoes, obviously. Polar. Parkas and pullovers, particularily. Tried quail? A quantity of quality quilts is quaint and quasiquintessential to avoid quivering and quash quarrelling if quarantined to one's quarters. Try quail. Reindeer. Well, not raw rookie. In a rosemaryrubbed roast with radish, wrapped in rich, rare bacon after removing Rudolph's red nose. Sleddin'. So, we're sound. Sled's a synonym for snowmobiles. Snowmobile's a synonym for sled. So, a sled is a snowmobile, a snowmobile is a sled. Super? Terrific. Trust a traditional turtleneck to maintain a toasty temperature over time. Ugly. Useful. Vile. Valuable. Whatever. Whiteouts and wind chills, walk it off, whiners. Withdraw whimpering and wake up, wankers. Wrathful wicked weather. Wear woolens or waterproof wardrobe. Warm your wet workwear by the woodstove. Winter is wonderful, wild and wide. Exactly. Exceptionally. Yup. Yeah. Zero. Degrees? Well, subzero. Aw, zip it. Guess those idiots won't be bothering us anymore, neeyawa. How are you now? Please don't talk to me like a fuckin' hick. Not so bad. Are you serious with that fuckin' turtleneck? You lose a lot of heat in the neck. I'm okay, if that's what you're askin'. That's what I'm askin'. I wasn't ready to have a kid. Well, that is your choice to make. You're goddamn right it's my choice. Sure, it is. I'm glad I took care of it. Well, that is your right. You're goddamn right it's my right. I'm not even sure if it was yours, but thank you. Thanks for the smokes and Pepperettes. I'll see ya when I see ya, boo. Over and out. You gots a cold there, Darys? Hmm, just a cough. Well, you knows what they says. If you don't take care of a cold, she'll stay for seven days. If you take care of it, she'll be gone in a week. Yep. We can't promise summers but we'll guarantees winters. You fuckin' serious with that turtleneck? Yeah, you lose a lot of heat in the neck. Jivin' Pete says he pulls a pikes outta here yesterday. Heard Jivin's been hanging out with some degens from up country. He's a decent guy, but ain't no way he pulled no pike outta here yesterday. Says he pulled a pikes, a perch, a wallseyes and a trout. Is that a brook trout? No, it'd be lake trout. Why's that? 'Cause we're on a fuckin' lake, Dary. I'm hungry. There's whitefish in the cooler. Well, how the fuck did that get there? I pulled outta here before you's got here. No, you never. Did too. No, you never. Did too. No, you never. If you did you'd still be talking about it. Oh yeah, well, where'd it come from then? Well, you brought it from home likely. Well, there's nothin's even to cooks it on anyways. You gonna let that stop you? What do you means? Haven't you ever heard of sashimis? Sashimis? Oh, I got time for sashimis. What about sushi? Sushis. Oh, I got so much time for sushis. Yeah, we should pull it out and hack it out and down the hatch. Oh no, I knows what it is, I just. I just don't think you needs to put an s on the end to that word. Hey, Dary, you ever had sushis with shrimps? Yeah. You ever had sushis with unagis? Yeah. That's eels. Oh, I know that's eels. I just. I'm pretty sure you don't needs an s to pluralize those words. Hey, Dary, you ever had sashimis with salmons? Oh, yeah. You ever had sashimis with tunas? Yeah. With wasabis? Oh, yeah. Love wasabis. I like wasabis, too. If asks you politelys to stop this, would you do it? Oh, you can have yellowfin tunas, bluefin tunas. I think tunas make the best sashimis. I thinks I'm having a panics attack. Well, the Japanese call the bluefin tunas maguro tunas, those are kind of like the default tunas that they use in sushis. Yeah, but toro is a more expensive tuna but it makes the best sashimis. Oh, it's way better than salmons. Hey! When's. When's Katy's gettin' back from the citys? Oh, she'll come back when she's good and ready. She'll figure it out. I figure she'll be back for sledding season. Oh, Katy loves sleddin'. It chap your ass at all that there's only one shack on the shed trail through Letterkenny? Well, it doesn't chap my ass, but I guess there could be another stop along the trail for a social. Yeah, like it doesn't chap my ass either, but I'm just sayin' that sleddin' and socials go together like piss and a fart. Yeah. I guess there could be another stop along the trail for a social. Could be another stop along the trail for a dart. Well, it's a great spot for a dartyparty. So, we're gonna build a new shack? I'm surprised we're not buildin' a new shack right now. That's what I'm sayin'. I figure it's about time that we stopped talkin' about it and started bein' about it. Oh, we could just throw up the structure and get all the materials paid off sellin' twodollar cans. Twodollar socials. Yeah, we could sell whitefish sashimis to help expedite the process. Oh, we could get real stinky and sell perch and walleye sushis. Hey! Walleye. Perch. And whitefish. Are not. Sushi or. Sashimi grade. Well, yeah, I guess you'd have to do pot to accomplish that sort of appetite. Says you. Pregame sandos? Check, buddy. Pregame nappies? Check, bro. Don Cherry's Rock 'Em Sock 'Em 6 for motivation? Don Cherry's Rock 'Em Sock 'Em 6. Chel Tourney for game situation visualization? Second Chel Tourney for peak performance imagery. Pregame dump? No pregame dump. Hmm. No pregame cruncher. No pregame deucer. Better go drop that bomb. Better go release the chocolate hostage. Better bust a grumpy. Better go call in a code brown. Better go boost one. Eat. Sleep. Boost. Caffeine. Check. Creatine? Check. Livin' the dream. Livin' the dream. Hold my spitter. Hold my spitter. All right, how're we gonna fuck this pig? Well, you're gonna wanna starts with dimensions. What're you thinkin' there? 14by16. What, you wanna play dodgeball in there, Dary? 14by16, well, that's five me's, five you's and five Dary's. You wanna play three team dodgeball in there, Dan? Call it 12by14. You wanna play fuckin' dodgeball in there, Dary. 12by14. That's four me's, four you's and four Dary's. You wanna play twoteam dodgeball with one sub each in there, Dan? How about 8by10? Well, I'd fuck with 8by10. No, you're not playin' no dodgeball in no 8by10s. I never wanted to play no dodgeball in no 8by10. Oh, I got so much time for 8by10. 8by10, that's three me's, three you's and two Dary's. Comfortably? You're cozy. Plus some wiggle room in there. Call it 8by10. Call it a Texas size 104, good buddy. Show you how we're gonna have the structure. What we're gonna do is put a space heater here, mini fridge here. Gonna throw the genny right out there. What about the sushis and sashimis? Hey!  Hey! Hey. How're ya now? Good, and you? Not so bad. You fuckin' serious with that turtleneck? Lose a lot a heat in the neck. You fuckin' serious with that hair? Figure it out. You figure it out. Where you's been? Modeling. How's that for you? Boring. Okay. There's no money in it. Way she goes. A monkey could do it. Good enough. Missed sleddin' season, too. I told you she'd miss sleddin' season. I was the one who said she'd figure it out. You figure it out. You figure it out. Where's your shits? About that. These are. My friends. Well, what are your friends named? Shep and Kingsley. Those are dude's names? Yeah. They sound like dog names. I don't like where this is goin'. We'll be in my room. Guys, hang up your coats. Where's your fuckin' shirt, Shep? Where the fuck is your shirt, Kingsley? It ripped. It ripped? Mine too. How? 'Cause I'm so fat. Me too, I'm so fat. I'm a bat fastard. I'm a fat podger. Guys. Enough, let's go. If I was a Dr. Seuss book I'd be The Fat in the Hat. If I was an arcade fighting game I'd be Mortal Komfat. If I was one of the five boroughs in New York City I'd be the Fatten Island. If I was an Italian citystate I'd be the Fatican. Put a fuckin' shirt on! I don't know what happened to you dusters, but, fuck me, do you fuck dog! Walkin' around poutin' like your little sister took your last Oreo. And not a traditional Oreo, no, a limited edition Oreo, or seasonal Oreo they're gonna take off the shelf for another year. Hey, Barts, did little Natiesha take your last Halloween Oreo? You didn't get a chance to say goodbye to that delicious orange frosting? What about you, Yorkie? Huh? Did little Tamsyn take your last Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Oreo? Well, it gets worse. Those have been discontinued forever. What about you, Scholtzy, huh? Did little Tay'Rhonda take your last Ice Cream Oreo Orange Sherbet? That is a summertime flavor. Good luck suckin' back on one of those in the next six months. Fisky, I know. You're a Birthday Cream Fudge guy. They're all gone. What? Little DeSondra was the culprit. And her pal LarawnShawn took the last Heads or Tails Mega Stuff, too! Hey, Boomtown. You're an only child. You got your NASCAR Daytona Oreos? It's fucking embarrassing! Let me give you some advice, donkeys. Take a page out of Jonesy and Reilly's book. My boys, I skipped curfew call for you last night 'cause I knew you'd be doin' legs, and I didn't want to interrupt. We've been doin' legs twoadays since the first week of summer, Coach. Blocked every wheelchair ramp in the arena so we'd have to do stairs. Tenacity. You can't teach that. You know, I never thought those pheasants would fuck the dog so hard that you two would become my studs! Thanks, Coach. Thanks, Coach. Well, I need one win. One W. What are you gonna do to get me that? Selfish hockey. Selfish hockey. That's right. Selfish hockey! Break it down. Skate the puck. Don't pass it. Head man's still gonna be there when you catch up. Take it coasttocoast. Shots from poor angles are still shots. Buck and a half, twominute shifts, three minutes even. Cruise the blue line to catch your breath. Bad bounce, that's a good breakaway. Gotta get the bounces, boys. Perfect. And a retaliation penalty never hurt anyone. What's our mantra?. They don't ask how, they ask how many. That's right. What did I tell you about stick tape? You don't need it! The only people that'll be worrying about puck handling are Jonesy and Reilly! Save it for them! Huh? W! Well, let's fuck this pig. Structure goes here. Sled parking here. Pretty good spot for pissin' over there. Pissin' outside's for dogs and degens. I piss outside as much as the dog does. Well, I'm not above it either. I'm just sayin'. Fuck, we could really use some kind of bar in this town, eh? Katy. Big brother. How're ya now? Good and you? Not so bad. My friends need to borrow clothes. Give 'em barn clothes. I won't have barn clothes in the house. They stink. Guess you have to put your friends in the fuckin' barn then. They don't have any clothes of their own. Okay. They don't have any money. Way she goes. Models are always broke. Good enough. You have a baker's dozen plaid shirts. They only need two. Give them the handmedowns I got from Dan's second cousin. Who, Garrett? No, Jarrett. 104. Over and out. These are the only ones that fit. 'Cause we're too podgey. Ugh, don't start. If I was a major league baseball team I'd be the L. A. Podgers. If I was a major league baseball pitcher I'd be Podger Clemens. If I was a pickup truck I'd be a Podge Ram. If I was a disguising clothing pattern made for hunting and combat I'd be camoupodge. No, better without the shirts. Okay. Now, go shut both doors and lock them.  Roald.  You'll need to repeat that. He's gone. He's gone? Along with all his stuff. Devon is gone. Roald. Dude. Hysterics are fruitless. (HIGHPITCHED SQUEAL) Stewart. Tears are useless. Stewart. Pain is inevitable. Where? Why? W motherfucking five! I don't know. He had everything here. Hours upon hours of ultracompetitive gaming laced with hiphop karaoke. Add a dash of latenight loitering and a splash of petty vandalism. And what have you got?. Stewart. Utopia, Arcadia, Kingdom come! Devon hated petty vandalism. He called it twobit. Shabby. Shoestring. Mmm, hence the term, petty, Roald. Don't be redundant. But you're right, he did hate that. This was his. Verify. Yeah. Yes. You got it the summer before grade six at a Sidewalk Sale Day. Went halfsies on it. Veracious. And this? Roald, substantiate! Yes. You stole it from his grandma so you could game Ecco the Dolphin on Sega CD in grade three. Irrefutable. Well, I guess he didn't take all of his stuff, now, did he? Fuck me, that was refreshing. Incoming! Stink bombs? Devon. Fuck, she looks friendly as a couch, ain't she, boys? Went up faster than shit through a goose, too. Licketysplit. Real nice of Tyson and Joint Boys to help us out. More hands make less work. Welp. Fire up the genny, Gary. Now test out the motion sensor, Dan. Boss, man. I appreciates this. Aw, it's tits. Well, there's one step left. Yeah! Christen it? Should we christen it? Well, are we gonna christen it? Should we christen it? I feel like we should be christening it. Well, I'm surprised we're not christening it right now. Gordie Howe hat trick, ferda. Game puck goes to Gordie. Yeah. I had 18 shots on net, boys. Ovechkin numbers. Played no less than 38 minutes. Duncan Keith numbers. But, uh, 94 ferda. Ferda other team. You know, it's sick, unreal stats. But, uh. Be nice to have a couple of W's, too. Be nice to have a W. Players only meeting? Yeah. Coach is right, I mean, no W's on the season that's just. Fucking embarrassing! Coach. Players only meeting. Oh. Well, that's embarrassing. Jesus. All right you pheasants, what's the problem? Spill it, pheasys. My wife left me, you little bitch! Feels like someone ran a coarse glove hustle on my love muscle. Yorkie? Same, Barts. Feels like someone forkgored my pork sword. Scholtzy? She's gone. Feels like someone took a big snackers on my little knackers. Pussy. Fisky. Out the door. Feels like someone slammed a super soccer kick into my RonDonny long schlong. Boomtown! I'm an only child, as Coach previously and pitilessly pointed out. I'd kill for a little Natiesha, Tamsyn, Tay'Rhonda, DeSondra, LarawnShawn, in my life. But someone did steal my last NASCAR Daytona Oreo! That wasn't funny! But, you all love your wives. What happened, boys?   Angie? Boys. Unreal game. Who wants to take me out for a sando? I'll let you work it out. Angie? That's my girl, you little bitch. She makes me want to rub slick on my disco stick. Yorkie? Correction, Barts. She's mine. She makes me wanna go Warcraft all over my man shaft. Scholtzy. Mine. She makes me wanna take a low fiver to my deepV diver. Pussy. Fisky? Uhuh. She's mine. She makes me wanna take a fresh fruit to my flesh flute. Boomtown! You all have sisters. I hope you're kind to them. I hope you cherish them. This one's mine! This is bad, buddy. This is really bad, buddy. I think we've got. A puck bunny. It looks darker out here than the inside of a fuel tank. Head towards the sensor light, Dan. I don't appreciates this. Well, how we gonna fuck this pig? We find who did it. And we beat the shit out of them.
