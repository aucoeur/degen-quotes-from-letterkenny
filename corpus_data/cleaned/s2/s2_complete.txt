You're out pickin' stones with your pals the other day. Sundays are for pickin' stones. Tale as old as time. Would you rather pick stones or pick worms? Well, pickin' worms is done at night and it can gets rather brisk. So I'd say pickin' stones 'cause it's in the sunshines. There's been an incident and I'd like to talk about it. Get after it. Well, PitterPatter, let's get at 'er. Spit it out, big shoots. I seen Stewart's horn. What? You seen his impaler? His bobby dangler? Well. You seen his PhD? His WMD? Now, look, fellas. You seen his friendly weapon? His sticky grenade? His ground squirrel? Yeah, I seen his ground squirrel. You seen Stewart's middle stump? You've seen his custard slinger? Well, I'm comin' up the stairs and he's comin' out of the bathroom just naked as a jay bird for some fuckin' reason. I round the corner and, yeah, so I seen his, uh. His hollow point. His hard drive. Well, his floppy disk is what I seen, yeah. Well, what's the evaluation? Yeah. I'd hear an assessment. You wanna know what? Looked like a tall boy can of Red Bull hangin' there. No. Looked like a tube of tennis balls hangin' there. A fourpack. Shut up. Looked like a fuckin' policeman's flashlight from the 1980s hangin' there. You're joking. That is no joke. Good job, Stewart. That's what I said. I said, good for him. Good for you, Stewart. Like I'm happy for him. Yeah, it's really good for him. Well, it's a terrific opportunity. Good for you, Stewart. Pump the brakes. Stewart isn't a really big dude. Are you sure the size of his horn wasn't accentuated by his really tiny frame? Looked like a oneliter thermos hangin' there. Because. Because, you know, a really big dude can have a massive horn, but it would look really small in proportion to his gigantic frame, right? Have you been reading my diary? I'll tell you what, it looked like a deflated football hangin' there. Fuck! You wanna know what? There's such a thing as too much horn talk and a fella ought to be fuckin' aware of it. Like, none of these donkeys even dip, bro. None of these chumps even chew, bro. Like none of these dunces ever had a dinger? These losers never had a lipper, bro. Like chill out, have a chaw. Peace out, have a pull. Have a hogger. Have a danger. Have a hammer. Say hello to Sergeant Spitter, boys. Spitter! Spitter! Big roadie this weekend, schmelts. Let's see some heart. Where we goin', boys? You don't know? Check the schedule. This is senior A whale shit hockey! Do you think I check the scheddy? I don't give a shit about the scheddy. Take a lap, lifer. Hang 'em up, hero. Shut it down, Tom Scheddy. Hit the showers, Scheddy Vedder. You're softer than Scheddy Ruxpin. Schmelts got jokes, Yorkie. They won't be laughing for long, Barts. You're about to meet the natives, boys. The senior A natives. You thought the juniors were tough? The senior natives will fuckin' kill you. You got the native flu, you little bitch? Yorkie. That's the native flu if I've ever seen it, Barts. Scholtzy. You scared of the natives, pussy? Fisky. Fever. Body aches. Nausea. All symptoms fraidycats fake to get out of playing the natives. Boomtown. I hate fraidycats like I love my wife. Intensely. I love her so much. We do not have the native flu. No? So what's got you looking like a fraidycat, you little bitch? Yorkie. Cacophobia? The fear of ugliness? Don't think so. I'm gorgeous. Scholtzy. Coprophobia? The fear of poop? Nah. You both pooped your pants when we mentioned the natives, pussy. Fisky. Alektorophobia? The fear of chickens? Uhuh. 'Cause you'd be afraid of each other. Boomtown. Pentheraphobia? Fear of your motherinlaw? Fuck that. I love my motherinlaw like I love my wife. I'm a good man. It's not the native flu. You're a cry baby. You're barely off the tit, you little bitch. Yorkie. Put the bottle away, Mom. He still wants the tit. Scholtzy. You're scared of the natives, pussy? Fisky. Gutless. Spineless. No heart. Boomtown. I'm a good man. Check the schedule, schmelts. Know the schedule, schmelts. Watch some Scheddy Murphy. Pussy. Fisky. Listen to some Scheddy Van Halen. Boomtown. Or Sched Sheeran. My wife loves Sched Sheeran. Schmelts have the native flu, boys. Those aren't real things. I'm not checking the scheddy. Fuck the scheddy! Fuck it! Fuck it. Yeah! How do you like that, schmelt? Let me go! No! No! Let's do it. We, uh. We need to talk, boys. Uh, but not to her, boys. Piss off. You were getting squeezers from each other's billet sisters the entire time. Dude, did you tell her about those handys? Who told her about the glovers, bro? You just did. Shit. Fuck. Fuck it. We got a roadie to the rez this weekend, boys. Big roadie to play the natives this weekend, boys. You got the native flu? We do not have the native flu. We do not have the native flu. Don't be scared to admits it. Those natives are tough as hell. Yeah, those natives are tougher than hell. Look, we can handle the natives in the rink, boys. We know we got business in their barn, boys. But Tanis and her troops are gonna be waiting for us in the parking lot, so we. We need back up, boys. Hard no. Aw, come on. Where's your jam, bud? Not my pig. Not my farm. Where's the sacrifice? Oh, get off the cross, we need the wood. We tuned 'em up on our turf just a fortnights ago. Yeah, we step back on theirs now, that's a suicide mission. Mmm. I heard Tanis wants the ban on Letterkenny lifted, too. Then she shouldn't have burned down the fuckin' produce stand. Come on. Where's your goddamn hustle, bud? Let's see the hustle, boys. When a man asks you for help, you help him. PitterPatter. Well, I guess I haven't been in a scrap in a while. We could go get bags of darts, too. And their venison pepperettes are not to be missed. I pert near popped a street meat vendor outside of a Jays' game one time for sellin' me a venison dog. Ain't no goatdagoddamn way that's venison dogs. No. Well. I'd go for a scrap. We'll need reinforcements. Joint Boy? Yeah, you could call JB. What about. No. Oh, you mean the Ginger? Hard no. But? Now, everybody listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once, we never talk about it again. You understand? We all lay off the Ginger and Boots now. Because the Ginger and Boots did not fuck an ostrich. Yeah, I heard they fucked two ostriches. Allegedly. Folks'll say that it takes two people to fuck an ostrich. Three even. Folks are also saying that it was a sick ostrich. Allegedly. Now, I went on the Internet and researched ostriches. Firstly, ostriches can run up to 70 miles an hour. So catching one, even a sick one, is a super tall order. Yeah, but there was two of them. Secondly, when a male ostrich, it's called a cock, fights over a female ostrich, they're called a hen, they're known to kill each other by head butting. Probably should wear hockey helmets. Hockey helmets, buddy. Well, they'd need a race car helmet, likely. Finally, ostriches use their legs to defend from predators. And can use them to kill even their largest and most deadly enemies, which are fuckin' lions. That's the king of the jungle. Still just a cat. So you'll see there is no way the Ginger and Boots could have fucked an ostrich. Maybe they tranqed the ostrich. Like they roofie'd the ostrich?. You wanna know what? You should feel bad about even suggesting that the Ginger and Boots fucked an ostrich. Bad gas travels real fast in a small town. My research concludes that the only way the Ginger and Boots could have fucked an ostrich is if it was a dead ostrich. Ginger and Boots. a dead ostrich? I thought it was just sick! Oh, my! Ginny? The Ginger and Boots effed a dead ostrich. Oh, bother. Of course I know what the male ones are called! Check my browser history. Don't show her weakness, Stewart. I'm not. I'm sun burnt. Hey, you! Hey, you. This is awkward but your shirt seems to have shrunk in the wash. Not awkward. Things shrink in the wash. How do you explain your dick? Quick wit. Valuable asset. Must really serve a lady of the night like you well. He means you're a hooker. Thanks, Roald. You speak? Heard a song this morning that reminded me of you. Really? So cool. What was it? Die, Die, My Darling. Metallica. Love 'em. Actually, they have a song that reminds me of you, too. Oh? Yeah. Sad But True. Hmm. Why don't you run along and get your essentials? You know, long, smooth, cylindricalshaped objects. Actually, I'm just looking for some threeinch screws to hang a frame. Hey, you know what three inches looks like, right? She skewered you! Don't listen to him, Devon. They wanted you to go to debate school. Hey, what's up? We. We're just goin'. Kidding! I don't give a fuck. Look like you got a bad case of the native flu. Should've brought your fuckin' bodyguards. We do not have the native flu, okay! It's not the native flu! Right. And one tit's better than two. Tanis, what we want to do is go inside, rip a couple of snap bombs and then go home. Just wanna rip some snaps and bury some claps, Tanis. Hack some limbs and rack some PIMS. Lay beats and fill seats. Yeah? Yous want to get pucks deep? Get pucks deep. Yeah, get pucks in the net. Shut the fuck up. If yous think you're gonna make it into that rink, you're fuckin' stupid. Do some damage, boys! Wa'tsok. Listen, we're four lines deep of BFI's in there ready to speed bag you space men. What's a BFI? Big Fuckin' Indians. Not sure that's PC but you said it. If you chodes walk out of there with all your chicklets, then I'm a fuckin' ferret. Piss off. Cool. That's not cool. You ready for a chin check? Yup. You can avoid it if you want to. Nope. Hmm. I want the ban on Letterkenny lifted. There's some good money that can be made selling smokes there. Yous made your point. We fucked off. Point's not made yet. It's not calculus. Finite math is worse. Trigonometry fucked me. I forgot long division in grade six. Okay. Lift the ban on Letterkenny. We'll make a buck and yous can cruise the rez. Bags of darts? Yeah, go to the casino. Venison pepperettes? Yes. Go watch a fuckin' hockey game. Mmm. Nope. FBIs coming. Who's that? Fuckin' Big Indians! Now, one of yous farted right before she got here and she definitely thought it was me. Dan? I'd admits it. JB? Would've went out my window. Maybe she farted. It was me. Hey, since when did algebra become a quick wank? I once popped my grade nine math teacher over the Pythagorean theorem. Did you get expelled? Just suspended. Yep, called probability and statistics. Like probably never gonna need them statistics in your whole life. That's kind of like fractions. Like multiplying and dividing them. Like who the fuck's doin' that? My friend David does tool and dye and he uses fractions. Should have just got his fridge ticket. David has his fridge ticket. Then he should just drive truck. Well, it's never too late to drive truck. Oh! Eyelash. Make a wish. Wish you weren't so fuckin' awkward, bud. Five minutes! Yup. You ready, bro? Born ready, buddy. You stretch it out, bro? Good and limber, bro. I say we get a couple of shifts in before we answer the bell. Get a couple of shifts in before tea time. Get that first shot in and just keep goin', buddy. Don't hesitate, buddy. Take a shift, schmelts. Ooh! Pulled salad in the scrum. Got a mitt full, boys. You get any good shots in? Think I was on my feet for a bit there, bro. Hey, are you hurt or are you injured? Ah! Don't. 100% pure organic, grassfed, Triple A Alberta beef. Better believe it's 'Berta beef. What you got there? Top sirloins? Yeah, the New Yorks are grainfed. Three times the omega3's in grassfed. Bought and paid for. Well, you're gonna want 'em aged if they're top sirloins. Pump the brakes. Two things. One. We'll let those sit for 10 to 15 minutes till they're room temperature. Two. Where's the salt and pepper, bud? Don't you fuckin' start. S and P, the choice for me. I paid a Chair just shy of 20 for each of these Csuckers and I will not be told how to cook 'em. You paid 20 apiece for 'Berta beef? Only 'Berta beef. Well, no guff. But I wouldn't pay 20 apiece for Japanese wagyu. Always 'Berta beef. Hard yes. But I wouldn't pay 20 apiece for Australian wagyu. Gonna want a rib eye if it's a wagyu. Oneinch thick top sirloin. Grill at 400. Four minutes a side. Down the hatch. You are fuckin' up, bud. That's textbook. Not without the S and P. Those fine ranchers in Alberta'd be a Chair away from not sendin' it here if they knew you were sprinklin' salt all over the Csuckers. You're a Chair away from gettin' Csuckin' socked, good buddy. Montreal steak spice really should be a part of this conversation. Oneinch thick top sirloin steak. Salt and pepper heavily. Grill at 400. Four minutes total. Flip each minute to get the good grill marks. Let sit for two minutes. Down the hatch. Flip twice. Grill marks, bud. Sacrilege. I will strike you. Blasphemy. Do you wanna get striked? Finish the whole thing off with a real nice herbs and garlics butter. Don't fuck up my steak dinner, Dary! Any decent chef will tell you, you don't even want to let those things touch the grill. Make it dryer than a fart. What ya wanna do, pan sear it, both sides, finish her off in the ovens. Well, see, now that sounds like overhandling to me. You'd be overhandling them, Squirrelly Dan. Well, he'd be Squirrelly Dan'dling. Oh, yeah, me and Gordon Ramsay are both morons. You wanna know what? Meet half way. All right, no S and P, flip twice. Good. Rare to medium rare. Medium rare. Yo! Ding, ding, pink dicks. This one's mine. Throw them steaks on, Dary, this won't take long. Oh! Remember me, boys? Where's that 'Berta beef? Grill marks, bud. That's the twofight rule for the win, boys. Two fights, that's your night, buddy. Hmm. Hey, did you get any good shots in? No good ones, bro. He fishhooked me, so I chomped his finger. He gave me a pretty good seatbelt, so I pinched the shit out of the back of his arm, buddy. I fuckin' hate when that happens. He did too, buddy. Hey. We would have dusted them if they hadn't jumped us. Proper dustin', ferda. Oh, shit! Fuck, buddy. We would have dusted them if they didn't jump us. Proper dustin', ferda. Hey, shirttucker! That doesn't really narrow it down. You. Meet me half way. I'll level with you. We have a BFI on standby that will fuck you up. K. He'll lynch you. Good. He'll end you. That's redundant. You can end this if you lift the ban. You burned down our produce stand, Tanis. Listen. I don't want to call him. You can call him. Yeah, but I don't want to. Ah, give him a call. I'd rather work this out with you. Too much talk. Wait, wait, wait! We're having a really hard time on the rez, okay? And selling cigarettes in Letterkenny really helps us out. And all of the money goes back into the community. This dude doesn't exist, does he? I want you to meet someone. Dustin! We don't have a lot of money. And I'd sure like to play baseball. Please lift the ban, Wayne. You can get a glove for free at the Sally Anne. Just have Mom or Dad drive you down there. Don't, uh. Don't care much for kids, so. Bubba Wally! The cupboards are bare in the elders' lodge. And we're so tired and sore. Please lift the ban, Wayne. I've got plenty of fresh produce on the farm. Yous are welcome to it. Lego! Oh, fuck. A threelegged dog. And look, Wayne, another threelegged dog. It's cute, huh? Yous can come back once per week. Saturday mornings. Set up shop in the farmers' market parking lot. We'll spread the word. Niawen. Does this dude exist or not? Mmm. PitterPatter! Hey, Katy. Carrying lunch there? Yeah. You want a bite? Who's this? He looks just like you. You actually look great today, you know, in comparison to this bag of shit. Thank you. You're welcome. So? So? Still an unapologetically promiscuous tart? Yep. Still a heartbreakingly inadequate chronic masturbator? No! Hi, Roald. Whatever! Stewart, you and I were a bad idea. Evident. But I still think you're cool. Adios. Hey, Devon. Ugh! Want a bite? So what say that dude exists? He doesn't. Yeah, but what say that he did? What if he walks up and hoofs you right in the nuts like Joint Boy? JB's right, it's him or you. But a kick in the undercarriage? Did Tanis ever recover when I hoofed her? I think she kind of did. Just kiddin'. I don't give a fuck. You still sweet on her, though, Dary? No. Why? Bonnie McMurray, that's why. You're sweet on Bonnie McMurray? Oh, you bet I am. Ha. Same. Well, it's no fuckin' mystery, Murdoch. Better to be the dude doin' the hoofin' than the dude gettin' hoofed. Or the girl gettin' hoofed. Exhibit A. Tanis. But a kicks in the cojones? Well, it's too late once you've been hoofed in the nuts, isn't it? You stand there holdin' your ball sack wondering why you didn't hoof first. Or you stand there holdin' your box wondering why you never hoofed first. So what you're sayings is if that dudes existed. We've already established the dude doesn't fuckin' exist, have we not? You'd kick him right in the pills? I'm fuckin' irritated. Would you kick him right in the pillbox? I'm gonna go see what's on television. We're just speakin' hypoethically here, bud. Ain't no reason to get upset, Wayne!. Save me an Indian taco. How're you now? Does the dude exist or not? No. Yous worked through our finest. No one else measures up. Yet. Stay for a barbecue? No, thank you. Stay. What are yous cookin'? Wagyu. Wagyu? Wagyu New York. I was told you should go for the ribeye if it's a wagyu. Duh. How you cookin 'em? Oneinch thick wagyu, New Yorks. Heavily salt and peppered. Grill at 400. Four minutes total. Flip once a minute for those good grill marks. Let sit for two minutes and then down the hatch. Flip once a minute, eh? Grill marks, bud. Grill marks, bud. You were huckin' the ball around with your pals the other day. Say, uh. What's the deal with your sweetie there, Squirrely Dan? Well, I took her out last night. Where to? Outs to the chip truck. Fries and gravy? I had mine with gravy. She had hers with salts and malts vinegar. Do you know that salt and malt vinegar's a nontraditional way to dress your French fries in the United States? What the fuck is wrong with them? Like malt vinegar is not a staple condiment on tabletops in restaurants in the United States. Fuck, figure it out. That's what I say. I say, figure it out. Got no vinegars on the tables, no Krafts peanut butters. Figure it out. Fuckin' figure it out. Better not forget those fuckin' alldressed chips. No ketchup chips neither. Figure it out. Somebody really ought to write a letter. They do got six different types of Cap'n Crunch, though. How do you know that? Saw a comedian talks about it on the Juste Pour Rires. Can't remember his name, though. Good guy, though? A little longwinded for my taste. But, yeah, a pretty good guy. Well, glad to hear he's a good guy at least. They have running water down there? Anyhoo, the evening went so well that, uh, we got up to a little bits of a foolin' around. Did you French her?. Kind of out of line there, Dary. Did you go up her shirt? Now you're really out of line, Dary. We did French, that much I will reveal. Well, you already revealed that much, might as well just tell us if you went up her shirt. It's impolite to kiss and tell, Dary. I don't like to kiss and tell, but. The Frenchin's tooks a hard left turn, from which I have yets to recover. Do you wanna know what? I'm not asking you to kiss and tell, 'cause that's impolite. But. I'm kind of curious. Yeah, Dan, kiss and tell. I'm sure you boys have had a couple of curve balls thrown your way betwixt the sheets. Well, not to be impolite, but, you know, sometimes a gal will be kissin' around on, like, the area near your genitals, but not quite on your genitals. Makes me ticklish and insecure. You know, not to be impolite, but sometimes a gal will do some kissin' on the ears, which makes me uncomfortable, because even though I clean my ears, sometimes a tater will just roll out of there unexpected. I kind of likes both those things. Yeah, it's why you're called Squirrely Dan. Yeah, reason fuckin' five million. Well, nots to be impolite, but. This gal suggested that maybe I should have some attentions paid to my butts hole. That ever. Ever happen to you guys? Did you ever have a gal suggest that you need some attentions paid to your butts holes? I'll take that as a hard no, I guess? She put a couple of fingers up there and. It turns out you got a. An erogenous zone up there. Found. Found the hot button and. Gaves it a tickle and, uh. Yeah. Feels, uh. It feels pretty good, you guys, okay? Pop fly. I really liked it. It felt. Felt very natural. Nice. That's how you get the body in front of it. Get the body in front of it. They call it milking the prostate. Well, it's impolite to kiss and tell. Where's Stewart been, Katy? He's not talking to me. Why? I don't know. Here are your birthday pancakes, big brother. Don't fuck with tradition. Thank you. You're welcome. Happy birthday, Wayne. Jinx. You owe me a Coke. Well, see now, that you can get in the States. What you can't get, though, is Crush Cream Soda. We got you a present, Wayne. Two Cokes. We don't make a thing of birthdays in this family. Can we skip my supersoft birthday party then this year? Hard no! It's not a birthday thing, it's an efficiency thing. Uh, if you can be one thing, you should be efficient. We got you an appointment with a matchmaker. Get the. Take a. Well, start walkin'. Well, you won't do online dating. There's no more MoDeans, so you can't meet girls there. You're handcuffed, cowboy. Figure it out. Yeah, figures it out. Don't you tell me to figure it out. Yous are the ones should figure it out. All you have to do is sit down with a matchmaker, answer a few questions, and then she sets you up on three dates with girls that she thinks you'll jive with. Has anyone heard from Jivin' Pete lately? Oh, yeah, yeah. No, Jivin' Pete's one nut got all swole up. I don't give a shit about Jivin' Pete's one nut. No, no, this is a story about Jivin' Pete's other nut. Yeah, Jivin' Pete's had himself a botched vasectomy a little while back, so now his one nut's there all swole up bigger than the first nut that was all swole up. If you can believes that nonsense. Was Jivin' showin' it to people again? Oh, he's showin' it to people. I seen it. You seen it, Dary? Oh, I seen it. Yeah, I never seen it. It looks like a rambutan. Which is to say, this hairy fruit. So, not smooth like a persimmon?. No, although it is about the size of a persimmons. Which, of course, is much like a tomatoes. What sort of potent peace pipe was some prick pulling off when he titled tomatoes fruits? Well. Now both Jivin' Pete's nuts have a story, which I hope guarantees that I'll never have to listen to another story about Jivin' Pete's nuts. He's a good guy. He's a real good guy. No, he's a great guy. Wayne. You're looking for love. And you said it yourself, If you can be one thing, be efficient. Do's it once, do's it rights. Figures it out. Pitter patter, let's get at 'er, figure it out. You shouldn't gang up on people on their birthdays. We don't make a thing of birthdays in this family. She's comin' this afternoon. Don't be in your barnin' clothes. I fuckin' hate praccy, bro. It's SeniorA whale shit, bro. Why even praccy? Like, I'm just gonna praccy like a donkey. I could donk all day. Just blast clappers at the hash marks at the fuckin' plug tendy of ours. Clappys from the hashys, buddy. Just steppin' into one from the ladies' tees. Just bulldoze that speed bump. Just firin' ringers at his ears. Just firin' warmup ringers. Just tossin' chesthigh sauce at the boys. Just tossin' anklehigh rocket sauce. Just tossin' mad sui's up the middle. Just tossin' mad sui's through the trolley tracks. Just tossin' mad breakout sui's directly into the skates. Just tossin' mad breakout sui's. You know, it might be a fun praccy after all. I could donk all day, boys. I don't think I've ever sat on a hay bale before. That's a straw bale, and that's barley. Wonderful. Great. Um. So, a little bit about me. Uh, my service is called Goldilocks and the Three Dates. Katy. I forgot to tell her not to tell you that. So, I've modeled my business after the charming story that it's inspired by. I send my clients on three dates, and like the beds that Goldilocks laid down in after eating the three bears' porridge, maybe one is too hard, and maybe one is too soft. But in the end we hope that maybe one is just right. Katy. Get after it. You're losin' him. Okay. Wayne, why don't you just tell me a little bit about yourself. It's impolite to talk about yourself. Keeps his truck clean. Loves his dogs. Enjoys a beer and a smoke. Beer. Beer and smoke. That's. Wow, you know. I get it. Rustic. Trucks, got it. We will make this work. I love it, okay. And then, um, Wayne, can you just tell me a little bit about your past relationship? You shouldn't air your dirty laundry. Five years. Ended a while ago. No baggage. No baggage, love that. No baggage, no babies. Likey. This is fun. I'm having a fun time in this place. And, Wayne, can you tell me how much you make in a fiscal year?. Katy! It's impolite to talk about your money. He's no slouch. Okay. Touche. Well, I'm about to begin your story. Where maybe one is too hard. Maybe one is, um. But in the end. Yeah, you lost him. He seems. He seems nice. Do you live. Do you live in here? So, what did you think of Goldilocks and the Three Dates there, Wayne? Ready to fall in Goldilove? Or Goldilust? You won't be Goldilaughin' when I break your Goldilegs. Dim the Goldilights? Nights of your Goldilife? Use your Goldilanguage. Make her Goldilaugh. Make it Goldilast. Better Goldilay off, before they find your Goldilimbs in a Goldilandfill, Goldiliterally. Take her on a Goldilunch? Maybe a Goldilate suppers? Maybe she's a Goldilawyer. Ooh. You think I'm Goldilyin'? Enough Goldilip. A Goldilongshoresman will find your bodies in the Goldilake! Gentlemen, a question. A query. An inquis. Pitter patter. Has Katy mentioned anything about me not talking to her? Can confirm. Major league. It's working. What's working? By not talking to her, she will form the conclusion that I'm upset with her and eventually ask me why. Why you so butthurt, Stewart? Well, she acts like. Just kidding. I don't give a fuck.  Wait. So, you're upsets with her, and you wanna communicate that by not communicatings? Acutely. You are spare parts, aren't you, bud? Let me know if Katy asks about me. Heads up! Ow! I'm Kim. I'm a psychologist and a feminist. I'll be paying the bill. I'm Wayne. Wayne! Glen. How are you now? Ah, good and you? Oh, not so bad. Well, I guess the kitten's out of the clutch on this one. I also have to work as a waitress to make ends meet.  Sure you do. I'm Kim. Are you ever. Look at you. I'm lovin' this. You're like a shark. I'm scared. Like a Julie Moore, or like a Jessie Chastain. What can I get you to drink? Uh, we'll need a minute. Uh, please and thank you. Hmm. All right. Well, you'll take care of little Miss Nicki Kidman here till I get back, Mr. McConaughey? Sure, I will. All right. He crosses his arms. Are you aware of the psychology behind that? Now, when you say he, you're talking about me, right? He has wit. Do you know why you cross your arms? Feels like you're talking to two people right now. Crossing your arms, whether it be consciously or subconsciously, is a sign of defense. You're protecting your vital organs. Do you feel threatened by me? Well, I don't, but the other guy might. He is hilarious. Enough psychology for now. What do you know about feminism, Wayne? I know it's unsafe territory to discuss with a feminist. Why? Someone will start shoutin'. Why? I don't know. Feminism is the belief that women and men should have equal rights and opportunities. So, are you a feminist, Wayne? Well, I trust my sister with just about any job under the sun over a man. But 'cept this one, I guess. Excuse me? Not to be impolite but you're not exposed to talk about sex, politics or religion at the supper table. What do you want, Wayne? I'd have a Gus'n Bru, likely. Not what I'm asking. What's a Gus'n Bru? Ooh! I'll google it and find out. I'm kiddin'. I know exactly what it is. But we don't have any. So, what can I get you to drink? I'll have a Caesar and he'll have a. Pint of lager, please. Something local. Thank you.  All right. So, a local lager for Mr. Brando and a Caesar for Sandy Bullock. I love those orders. Be right back. I didn't think they'd have it at Four Dancers. Yes, I didn't think they'd have it at this restobar. Gastropub. Says restobar on the sign. It's more of a microbistro. Says brasserie on the menu right there, too. It's more of a bistrobrasserie. When I came in they asked me if I wanted to sit at the restobar or the gastrolounge. I'm glad you chose the restobar. This is actually the gastrolounge. Do you know what an emergency call is, Wayne? Negative. It's when you have a friend call 10, 15 minutes into a date to be sure the date isn't a total bust. And if it is, then you can play the phone call as though it's an emergency and leave the date. Well, that's fair. I guess we are first cousin to an emergency here. A good one. And you shouldn't be afraid of it. I think we could do good things here. I'm going to call my friend and cancel her pending emergency call, and when I get back, let's talk about your feelings, Wayne. Okay. Let's really talk about them. Okay. I wanna take 'em, and I wanna talk about them. Oh, it's Wayne. How are you now? Oh, not so bad. Yeah, this one's too hard. We don't have time to discuss that business. Devon. Stewart. I come in peace. How do we know you don't have another one of those in your sock? You don't. Speak. Do not approach. Seen Katy around? No. That is all.  Stewart! Trouble in paradise? If there was, she wouldn't know it. I'm not talking to her. Well played. Wait it out. That way she'll come to the conclusion that you're upset with her and ask you why. Precisely. She should anyway. If she's smart. I know. Why are you mad at her? She acts like. You should try an open relationship. Could be productive. You could also try a hall pass. It's when you give, you know, her being allowed to sleep with one person and that's it, no questions asked. Another plausibly fruitful option. New GTA and COD out today. We're going to sesh. Been gaming much? Always gaming. You? Just gamed. Stimulating morning game. Evening game will eclipse. I gamed a 00to00 shift last night. You're gaming taxi driver's hours? I gamed a 00to00 shift today. Gaming banker's hours. I'll probably game a 00to00 shift now. Cinq a sept. Nous aussi. You guys wanna hit up a happy hour? We're gonna hit another happy hour. Heads up!  Ow!  I'm Lisa. Wayne. Wayne! Glen, how are you now? Good and you? Not so bad. Well, I guess the teddy's out of the tickle trunk on this one, too. I also work here. Reason is the Salty Treat blew out an amp the other day, rockin' out pretty hard to some Lifehouse covers, which will happen. So, I'm pickin' up the slack. I'm happy to do it. Way she goes. I'm Lisa. Are you ever. Look at you! It's America's little sweetheart over here. You're like a little Katy Heigl or like a little Katy Hudson. What can I get ya? Do you have cookies and cream? Do I. Do I have cookies and cream? I sure do have cookies and cream. And I'm thinkin' maybe a vanillafudge swirl chunk for Mr. Newman over here? That'll do, thank you. Okay. And you're gonna keep an eye on little Caty Blanchett here for me till I get back? Sure will. Thank you! Be right back! So, you're a farmer, Wayne? Can confirm. You don't smell like one. I'm kidding. I'm a preschool principal. Do you like kids? Hmm. I know, everyone likes kids. They're so silly. I love them when they're silly. But if they get too silly, they have to come see me. Silly? Mischief. Trouble. We use gentler terms. As a policy. Well, so what happens when they come see you? Well, we do things a little differently in our program. The approach is progressive and positive. We issue a hug consent form to parents, which allows us to hug their kids. Because 99% of the time, all kids need is a hug. A hug? A squeeze. Well, you squeeze 'em. An embrace. Oh. Oh? Well. What is it? Nothin'. Wayne. Yeah? Speak freely. No, I'd better not. That's the only way we'll get to know each other. But do you ever smack 'em? Excuse me? Like, give 'em a good whack? I don't follow. Do you ever hit the kid? Like, for being too silly. No! Wayne. We never hit our kids. You shouldn't hit kids. Well, you know what, don't you remember how scared you were of your principal when you were growing up? It's 'cause he'd smack you if you were being too silly. Like your parents wanted you to have a principal who would smack you. They took comfort in the fact that they were sending you to a place every day where someone would smack you for them if you were being too silly. And sometimes I see kids these days, I kind of think, like. Like, wish you could still do that. That sort of discipline is long outdated, Wayne, and frowned upon. We sit the child down. That's another problem. What is? In my opinion. Sitting? Well, no wonder kids are failin' school, just sittin' around all day. Stand up, you're not doing nothin'. You think sitting is a problem? Yeah. Why? 'Cause it makes you soft. Literally or figuratively? Well, both, I suppose. Both? Yeah. In my opinion. My phone's buzzing. Well, so you like cookies and cream ice cream, hey? Well, I think it's pretty good, too. Hi, Michelle. Oh, no. Okay, I'll be right there. I'm sorry, Wayne, I've gotta go. It's. An emergency. Yeah. Okay. It's Wayne. Well, how are you now? Oh, not so bad. Yeah, this one's too soft. What? I'm not talking to you. Super.  It's been three days. Why haven't you asked me what's wrong? Something wrong? Of course it is. You act like I don't. Should I have known that? It's called the silent treatment. Step one, I stop talking to you. Step two, you form the conclusion that something is wrong. Step three, you ask me what's wrong. What's up with step one? You've skipped step one and two. What's step three again? You ask me what's wrong! Got it. Good. You bet. Go ahead. Where? Step three. What's step three again? We'll skip step three. I'm just going to tell you what's wrong. That should have been step one. Wrong. Step one and two are fundamental steps. You missed steps, Stewart. How? Step one, become angry with someone. Step two, tell that someone that you're angry. Step three, resolve anger with that someone. Step four.  Step four. Step four, resume peaceful existence. Your logic is frighteningly bewitching. Phantasmagoric. It's time for you to go. What? Where? Leave here? It was a rebound. Even though there was no physical act of rebounding, which is a first for me. Gross. Seriously, Katy. W5. No one has time for the silent treatment, Stewart. Not even in Letterkenny. Adios.  Heads up!  Nice try, shirttuckers! Ow! Hi, Wayne. Angie. Wayne! Oh, my gourd, what a coincidence. Oh, I bet you're thinkin' I work here. I don't work here. I just love Guy's fries. They're so crispy, and you add a little salt. I just think they're so delicious. Ooh! Who is this? You're a masterpiece, aren't ya? You're like a Shelly Pfeiffer, you're like a Charlie Theron, or like a Penny Cruz. Ooh! You're like a little Angie Jolie. That's who you are, you're Angie. How are you now? Good and you? Not so bad. Can we talk? Okay. Talk. In your truck. Okay. Now that was just right. So how did you make out, super chief? Did you find the missing Goldilink? You fallin' in Goldilove? It's better to Goldilet this go, before I Goldilose my shit. Oh, take your drink, you Goldilush. Tread Goldilightly. So, that's no toecurlin' then? It's impolite to kiss and tell. Nothin' wrong with a little stank on the hang down. Nothin' wrong with a little takesin' out in the trades. A little hizzin' in the skizzins. No, I know there's nothin' wrong with a little goin' to the bone yard, I know that. Nothin' wrong with a little bacon makin'. Nothin' wrong with a little shot twixt winds and waters. A little building the blanket monster. I know there's nothin' wrong with a little pituitary poke. I know that. Nothin' wrong with a little makin' the beast with two backs. Makin' feet for children's stockin's. Testing the tube steak. Look, I know there's nothin' wrong with a little crawl up the skin slide. I know that. Nothin' wrong with a little, Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Now just pump the brakes right there. I got a question. Have at 'er. Then I got a comment. Well, let's hear it, good buddy. Now, my question. When have you ever heard a girl go, Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Well. Other than in a porno. I don't believe I have. Me neithers. That's because we don't say that. Well. Not unless it's in a porno. Now my comment. You see, the way Dary did the yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's is not the way they do the yes, yes, yes in pornos. That's the way they do it. The girl gets all excited, and she goes, Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, but the way you're doing the yes, yes, yes, yes's is not the way they do the yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.. It is the way they do it. They go, Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. That's exactly how they do it. No, they don't. What they do is they find a superhigh pitch for those first four yes's. And then they come in all dramatic for that final yes. So, it goes a little something like, Yes, yes, yes, yes. And then they get all dramatic for that final yes. Say, Yes! Oh. I don't think that's how they do it. I'd have to hears it again. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Yeah. Yeah, porno girls do that. But only when the porno guys aren't busy finding some superlow tone and repeating over and over again, Ah, fuck. Ah, fuck. I takes a bit offense to that, Miss Katy, as I have a naturally low voice, and I do likes to say, Ah, fuck. Ah, fuck. Exceptin' I don't do it in pornos. Well, then you should do voiceovers for Englishdubbed foreign pornos, Dan, because that was a text book ah, fuck, ah, fuck. Why thank you, Miss Katy. I've never had any complaints from any of my sexual companions about my ah, fuck, ah, fuck.. Let me hear yours, Dary. Well, I. I'm confused still on the yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's. So, Wayne, it's like, uh, Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes? See, it's not as if it's a fuckin' question, Dary, is it? You're saying it like it's a question. So, it's like, Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. You're gettin closer, Dary, but what you want to do is put a little pepper on the end of it. You just want to put a little pepper on the end of it. Like, Yes! Yes! Ah, fuck. It's like, Yes, yes, yes. Ah, fuck. .yes, yes, yes! Ah, fuck. Like, Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes! Just having a fight with my hat.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Feels really good. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Three praccys a week, buddy? Three praccys a week in SeniorA whale shit, buddy. Half these guys wheel their fuckin' bags into the rink. The day I fuckin' wheel my bag into the rink is the day I stop playing hockey. Afuckin'men, buddy. Why do we even praccy, buddy? Should be rippin' sandos. See me toss the sauce in the skates all night long, buddy? Just tossin' rocket sauce straight into the blades, boys. I don't even know what a tapetotaper is anymore. Not sure what a tapetotaper is anymore, buddy. Fuck tapetotapers, buddy. Fuck tapers. I fired a pointblank clap bomb directly into Barts's chest tonight. Fired a pointblank point bomb straight in Yorkie's junk. I snowed our plug tendy no less than nine times. I snowshowered our plug tendy and that was his own D, man. Praccy's not badski when you're donkin'. I could donk all day, boys. Attention. An amateur MMA asshole asks you to engage in aggressive altercation. Who the fuck is the toughest guy in here? That'd be me. Bullshit. Bopped you so bad in the bean you were beyond assbackwards. No blood, albeit bloody brutal. Clunk. Clocked your carriage, clipped your canopy, caught your conscious with a carefully concocted combative cuffing. Dink. Decked you defiantly. Easy. Ended you efficiently. Fuckin'. Fucked your face up from front to Finland in a fairly unfair fashion unfortunately for females. Goof. So you got up, gathered your goods, guts and gonads, got after the goofy goon, gave glory a good go. Have at 'er. Hucked a haymaker. Instantly. Irked the idiot. Jackass. Outjuked the jerk. Outjabbed the joker. Outjammed the juice head. K. King Kong threw a karate kick that kinda caught you in the kisser. Loser. But that legend lady luck was lingering and you left you with only a lovely little lump on your lip. Mint. But maybe mention you may use MMA, Mr. Muay Thai. Nincompoop. Knees are unnecessary. Over it. Okay, onwards. Please. You outpunched the prick. Outplayed the peasant. Pushed proper pugnacity on the pinhead, left him praying for peace while Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. Quickly. He got queasy, wanted to quit, folks were quoted as quietly quipping he looked like a quirky, quackish queen on Quaaludes. Right. Roughed up the rook. Wrecked his reality. Ruined his rep. Superb. You socked the sucker. Slammed the sally. Secured the scuffle by successfully outscrapping the skirt. Tremendous. You took over the tiff. Outtangoed the tosser. Tough titties on that trade, you twit. No truce. Unreal. Utterly. Violent. Very. Wonderful. Well, whatever. Exceptional. Exactly. Yup. Yup. Zebra? Zip it. Tell us about your date last night, Wayne. Hard to the fuckin' no. Pitterpatter. Oh, I'd rather have a cupafart in the face. What's cupafart? Oh, that's when you farts into your hand and then cup it like you're transporting a tiny bird and release it into the face of an unsuspecting pal. There could be worse things. You're up! Well, for starters, I ran late chorin', so I didn't have time to get the truck washed before I went over there. So? Well, so what if Dad's standing there when I come up the laneway to pick up his daughter with a dirty truck? He'd say, Who's this tit? Fair. And I barely got the truck in park before she hops in there so I can't get the door for her. So? Well, so what if Mom's standing there and I come up the laneway to pick up her daughter and I don't get the door for her? She'd say, Who's this nut tugger? Fair. I couldn't get my footing after the rocky start so nothin' to report thereafter, fuck. Well, you lived to fight another day. Well, I am lookin' for love. Boy, howdy. Like I've been going on dates and will be going on other dates. Get after it. Like if there was a general theme, like, for the next six weeks, it would be, Wayne's looking for love. Could be worse things. Gentlemen. How're ya now? Perfect. Good 'n you? Same bat time. Same bat channel. Eh, shirttuckers? Now, I'd say give your balls a tug, but it looks like your pants are doing that for you. You look like you could lose a hand in there playin' pocket pool.  Here's a poem. Star light, star bright, why the fuck you got earrings on? Bet your lobes ain't the only thing that got a hole punched in 'em. See the muscle shirt came today. Muscles comin' tomorrow? You get a tracking number? Oh, I hope he got a tracking number. That package is gonna be smaller than the one you're currently sporting.  Tall order, Dary. You ever had a cupafart? You can cupafuck off. Hey, Katy. Hi, Dan. Gentlemen.   Seatbelt. That kid's a polished turd. Heard about you and your sweetie, buddy. Heard she cheated on you, buddy. That's a real kick in the knackers, bro. Just a real ouchie, bro.   Wait, does Stewart get points for opening Katy's door? Johnny Cash could have stepped out of that shit box and I'd still say, Why is it not clean? Well, should we jump into Dary's shit box and go to the Ags Hall? Now, I know McMurray's meetings can be a bits of a chore. Even worse when Mrs. McMurray's there. But the Ags Hall is as much ours as anyone else's, and we should be there for the important decisionsmaking. Squirrelly Dan, you'll be snoring within the first five and I'd bet as many bucks on it. Well, I had my coffee today so I will takes that bet. You don't need to shake, I trust ya. It's 'cause I cupafart, isn't it?. That was a very productive first hour and 45 minutes, I must say. On to item number 29 of 39. Yep! It's still item number 28, baby. Item 28 is a twopart item. Huh! Thank you, darlin'. MRS. You're welcome, baby. All right, on to item 28, part B. I, McMurray, motion that the front weather mat be changed, from a Remington charcoal, fourfoot by eightfoot by threemillimeter thick rubber doormat, to a raisin charcoal threefoot by sixfoot by threemillimeter thick ribbed vinyl boot tray. It came in a gainsboro grey also, which is a pale tone of grey. That's correct. It also came in puce. Puce is a warm grey, tonally. Grey tones don't clean up as well as dark tones. Hence, the raisin charcoal. Better look goddamn clean after you're done cleanin' the cocksucker, that's what I always say.   Mmmhmm. Would a member second my motion? I second, baby.  I second so hard. Thank you, baby, I knew you'd second the shit right out of it. Dan!  Daniel. Mm, he's a real deep sleeper. Oh, super deep. Like he fell asleep at the IMAX during Transformers 2. Fell asleep riding the back of a garbage truck one time. Intolerable. Daniel! Do you know dogs sleep for 80% of their lives? You wanna know what? He might be faking it. He's faking it. Oh, he's faking it. I can see he's faking it. Are you faking it, Dan? Look, I can see one of his eyes are open.  Yeah, he's faking it. Daniel! Don't touch it, it hurts. You better cut out all that goddamn snoring before I stuff a cocksuckin' work sock down your skull cave. Keep going, baby. Everybody's listening. Everybody loves you. Thank you, darlin'. You better listen to her, Daniel. Now, I'm sure you no doubt have all noticed that we are down to one dozen coat hangers in the front hall. There are approximately twelve dozen in the rear hall. All standard steel wire, baby? All standard steel wire in a flattened triangular shape. I, McMurray, motion that one dozen be transported to the front hall. K. Wayne. Wayne, Wayne, Wayne. Wayne. Wayne. Wayne. Look at me, Wayne. Wayne. There is a tried, tested and true system at work here. And, as President of the Agricultural Hall, I must demand it be respected. One member makes a motion. Then another member then seconds that motion. Second, K. K is not a second. Well, it's the second time I said K. So you second my motion? You want to know what? I'm all out of seconds, bud. So it's not a second? Well, this is taking too many seconds is what I'm saying. Well, you only have to second once. All right, give me a second. So are you saying that you second or that you need a second? Well, one second. All right. Wayne, you shall be given one second. Whilst Wayne is taking one second. I second the fuckin' motion, McMurray! Now move the fuckin' coat hangers! Well, thank you, Wayne. Let the secretary note that I, McMurray, motioned to move one dozen coat hangers. I'll move the fuckin' coat hangers myself. Can't sit around here all fucking day with my horn in my hands. Got chorin' to do, for fuck's sake. Would the secretary note that aforementioned coat hangers have such been moved. Thanks to a very overzealous beaver. There's order, people, and it must be followed. Concluded! Item 30 of 39. Wayne. Jim Dickins. How're ya now? Good'n you? Not so bad. Wayne, 100% bullshit 'round here. Got a bidder now, one. Lookin' at two. Two, and now at lookin' at three. Three hundred now, can I get a four? Four there now, sold. 400% bullshit 'round here. Well, it's never so bad it couldn't be worse. Worse than 400% sounds an awful lot to me like five. 500%, now lookin' at six. 600%, lookin' at seven. 700%, can I get an eight? Sold. 800% bullshit 'round here. Well, meetings run a Chair long but it's important business so. If someone doesn't do something about this bullshit soon. We'll be at nine. 900%, now lookin' at 10. Ten over there, now lookin' at 11. Can I get a 12. All right. All right, cool it. What would you have him do, there, Jim? If Wayne runs for Ag Hall president, I'll give him. One vote right here, looking at one, we got one vote here, and lookin' to get two. Well, see, now that sounds a bit dramatic to me, Jim. No. I don't think that's such a bad idea. Did that not sound a bit dramatic to you? I'd back that. Well, it's bloody Shakespearean. It'd be usurpin' the throne. I'd back that like a spinal cord. It just sounds dramatic to me. Jim! Tell you what, Jim. I'll think on it. Have a good one. Have a good one, Jim. One little birdie bird flying in the sky. We got two little birds and we're lookin' at three. Three little birdies, now we're lookin' at four. Why do birds suddenly appear every time I auctioneer?. Just a series of bad bounces for a couple of stick and pucksters, bud. Not getting the bounces, bro. Cut from the Letterkenny Shamrocks in our overage year, bud. No victory lap for the Shammy's, bro. No victory lap, ferda. Ferda. And no Katy. KatyKat stepped out. Twotimed. Played around. Caught a matinee. Carried on. You know, I should be mad, but I'm just sort of. Sad. Give your balls a tug, you tit fucker! Not gonna miss playing with Shoresy, though, bud. Always a silver lining, buddy. You know, bud, he's right. Game faces on, it's our first day of senior hockey, bud. Well, first impression's a lasting one, bro. Are you ready for this, bud? Forecheck, backcheck, pay check, bro. Ding! What the fuck are you doing?. What does it look like?. Doing legs. Leg day! Where's Stormy been? I haven't seen her all day. In her pen. Why? She's being punished. Why? She tried to kill her stud again. That's my girl. Why? Well, fucked if I know, Dan. It's supposed to be natural for animals to want to breed. And fucked if those pups wouldn't be as beautiful as she is. She was a beautiful pup. She's a beautiful dog. She was a gorgeous pup. Well, she's a gorgeous dog. But why is she in her pen? It's 'cause aggression's to be discouraged. It's like Cesar Millan says, exercise, discipline and affection, in that order. I'd have a Bloody Caesar. Do you wanna know what? I'd have a Caesar, too. I could have a Caesar if you guys are havin' Caesars. Hard to see a Caesar and not want a Caesar. That's actually how they market Caesars. You should call up Gail over at her Bed and Biscuits. I bet ya she's got some studs for Stormy. Well, better to let the dust settle on Modean's burndown before I bug her. We need a new bar in this town. But why's Stormy trying to kill all her studs? 'Cause they're sayin' the wrong things, likely, just like humans. First line better be a winner. First impression's a lasting one. Like what? Well, to be honest, I've taken to breaking the ice with the lyrics from '90s pop songs. The words are penetrating because she's likely heard 'em before, but she likely won't realize it when they're spoken rather than sung with musical accompaniment. Five bucks says you cannot successfully sell me on this. Hey, girl, give me your heart. Make it real or else forget about it. That's Rob Thomas and Carlos Santanas. K. Hey, girl. I wanna stand with you on a mountain and I wanna bathe with you in the sea. Savage Gardens. Uhoh. Hey, girl, I swear by the moon, the stars in the sky, I'll be there. All4Ones. Well, fuck a duck. Hey, girl, I'll make love to you like you want me to, then I'll hold you tight, baby all through the night. Are you talking to me, you fuckin' greaser? You don't talk to me like that, you fuckin' pud. Argh! I'll beat the shit outta you. Ah! Don't! You're real good at beatin' up Dary and that's what I appreciates about you, Katy. Oh, is that what you appreciate about me? I'll stake 20 to 25% off her over there, Squirrely Dan. Hey, Roald, uh, I bet you have a name for your bong.  Samwise Ganja. Cool. Formerly known as Paul Tokenfold. Awesome. Formerly known as Air Bud. Hey, maybe your next one can be called Air Bud. Golden Receiver. All right, guys, we're outty. Peace.  Peace.  Bye, guys. Bye, Stewart, not Katy.  Pardon?  Huh?  I'll be in the car. Cool, baby. Devon, you may elaborate on your entanglement. And, Roald, your exasperation.  Cool, babe.  Speak! My entanglement is that when that came along, that started happening. Seriously, Stewart what are you even wearing? It's so gay. But you're gay. So what? He's a homophobe now, too.  No! Yes! I was born this way, Stewart! We don't even know where you are half the time. We're going to the Weeknd show. It's Tuesday. No, The Weeknd is here. In three days, yeah. No, I mean The Weeknd is here today. No, it isn't. Yes, he is. Who is he? The Weeknd. Wow! Slightly sexist statement to say Saturday and Sunday are the masculine ones. He's a misogynist now, too! No. Yes! I mean we are going to see The Weeknd perform. She's got you totally brainwashed, man. You don't even know what day it is. I was born this way, Stewart. Ahh! No, no, no!   Did you just stab me with an EpiPen? Pain is good.  Taste three mills.  Oh! Oh! What? If any bees come in here we are so fucked! Don't open those peanut M&Ms, Connor!. Epinephrine OD. Well, uh, Jimmy Dickskin. Dickins. Dickskin, that's what I said. You motioned for an emergency meeting and that's why we're all here. Goddamn Dickskin's cuttin' into my gin and tonic time, that's all I know. Dickins! That's what I said, Dickskin.  All right, well, Dickskin, you can have the floor. MRS. Dickskin. After, of course, we explore the several Agricultural Hall related issues that I have detected within the last 24 hours. Pick one! Well, as I've mentioned, there are several so we will begin with one of them. Well, don't bore us, get to the chorus. Wayne, you're uh, acting fairly curt. I'll be fuckin' Courtney if it gets us through this before Christmas. I motion Wayne assume the title of President of the Ag Hall effective immediately. All those in favor, gonna need one vote. Do we have one vote? Are we lookin' at one? One over here, now we're gonna need two. Two down, we got two. Lookin' at three for Wayne for president and we'll get it over there. Now gonna get four, gonna get four over here. Now we're gonna have four over here for Wayne for President. Can we get five? What've we got, five? Five over here now! We're getting into six. Six over here, feels good over here, now we're lookin' at seven. Seven over here now, can I get an eight? Eight now, can we get any more here?  You shit. No nine, that's all right, for my friend Wayne. Celebrate good times. Baby get along. Sold! This is a fuckin' outrage. You're out of order! This. It wasn't. It wasn't motioned. That's not the right way. There wasn't a motion. Well, you're about to find out how hard this job really is. You're in the hot seat now, big boy. It is fuckin' pipin' hot. Like 1500 goddamn watts. Well, you're gonna run 'er. I love you. I love you, so much. Anything pressing? Back to chorin'. Gotta break the ice here, boys. We gotta get the ball rolling, bro. First impression's gotta be a good one. First impression's a lasting one, buddy. You thinking what I'm thinking? Great minds think alike, buddy. You boys wanna go wheel some snipes after praccy? Wheel snipe celly, boys. Dirty fuckin' dangles, boys. I'm married, you little bitch. Yorkie? Happily married. Scholtzy? I love my wife, pussy. Fisky? I'd fallen in with the wrong crowd, went down a dark path. My wife saved me. Boomtown? I love my wife like I love doing legs. Okay. All right. Um. You guys wanna grab some sandos after praccy? Crush some appies? I'm glutenfree, you little bitch. Yorkie? Fuck gluten. Scholtzy? Gluten gives me gravy pants, pussy. Fisky? Glutenfree, dairyfree, gaseous intestinal byproductfree. Boomtown?

Winning hardware, winning gold. Boomtown? I love winning like I love glutenfree livin'. Okay, we really need to pull out the big guns on this one here, buddy. Dig deep. Bear down, buddy, okay? Have you boys ever heard of dinkerball? How about a round of dinkerball, boys? Dinkerball? Okay, I got this. Okay. You see, you grab your dink or your ball. You scrunch it up in your hand and then someone has to guess whether it's a dink or a ball. Dink or ball? You fuckin' serious right now? We don't want to see your junk, schmelt. Put your junk away, schmelt. Uh, schmelt? What's schmelt? So the schmelts want to play games, Yorkie. Yeah, I think we got a game for the schmelts, Barts. You like games, right? Sure.  You're out. Out of what? This. What's this? This. Is not your crew anymore. This is not your life anymore. This is not the weekend. It's Tuesday.  But this is. Not your basement anymore. This is my basement now. And you are not welcome. Are those loaded? Only one way to find out. The great playwright Anton Chekhov invented the principle of Chekhov's Gun. What is the principle of Chekhov's Gun? Ha! If in the first act you say a gun is in the room, then in the second act, it must absolutely go off. In other words, if you're gonna bring heat, you better use it. I'm preheated to 375, ready to go to 425, big boy. Blast off, Major Dongfucker. You schmelts ever played Duck, Duck, Goose? Yeah, with the four to sixyearold group we had at hockey summer camp. What are we, four to sixyearolds, boys? I guess you're four to sixyearolds. You schmelts ready? Close your eyes. Duck. Duck. Duck. Duck. Duck. Goose! Schmelts are gongshows, boys. Schmelts are gongers. This is better than doing legs, you little bitch. Yorkie? Let's do legs right now. Scholtzy? I love doing legs, pussy. Fisky? Stairs. Works calves, quads, glutes. Boomtown? I love doing stairs like I love winning. Let's do this, boys! How many games in this season, buddy? 42, buddy. Do you have any baby wipes? I don't, buddy. There's been. An uprising. K. I'm homeless. K. Wayne. Hard no. If a man asks you for help, you help him. You're gonna work the ground game, then, huh, Katy? If you asked me for help. I would help you. Oh, look, they're comin' land, sea and air now. You can stay here. Wondrous! For a couple of days. Favorable. That's 48 hours, max. Satisfactory. We'll put your shit in the spare bedroom. Come on. Hold it! End of the laneway. Don't come on the property. Rematch. K. Knocked you out. Can't believe you got back up. You come here to throw fists or flap lips there, big shooter? You suckered him. Still knocked him the fuck out. Then he got back up and knocked you out. So rubber match then. We already established that. Unless you wanna do some more talking. Good amount of chinwagging goin' on over there. All right, I suckered you. So we shake hands, clear the air, then we square off. Good enough. You're fuckin' 10 ply, bud. You're having some beers in the barn with your pals the other day. So, have you figured out what you're gonna do as first act of Ag Hall President there, super shoots? You're looking at it, pea shoots. No, he's talking about a charitable act, big shooter. We'll advise you there, shoots and ladders. We'll be your team, half court shooter. K. Like when Obamas became president, he started bringing troops home. Oh, is that what he did? Or when Trudeau became Prime Minister, he started bringing refugees over. Oh, did he do that? Whatever you do, just make sure peoples know about it. Yeah, like you're gonna want to have somebody come down from the paper, take a photo of it. Tweet a tweet, snap a chat. Why? Well, if it's not in the papers or on the Internets, it's pretty much worthless. You know what I think, we should almost be snapping a chat about us talking about doing the charitables right now. Pump the brakes. Now, am I doing the charitables for the charity's gain or my own? Well, you do the charitables for the charity, but the whole point of doing the charitables is that people think you're a good guy for being charitable. Yeah, behaving charitably, you'll have people saying, like, Oh, he's a good guy. Oh, he's a real good guy. Oh, he's a great guy. No! I think you have had too much sugar cereal. The whole point of doing the charitables is to help the charity and to make you feel good, not look good. Figure it out. Yeah, but it feels good to have people call you a real good guy. You figure it out. Oh, it feels even gooder when someone says you're a great guy. You figure it out. You want to do a charitable? Drive into town first thing in the morning, dead of winter, after a fresh snow fall. Shovel a handful of folks' driveways before they wake up. No one does a tweet. Feels fuckin' sweet. Also, it's a substantial core workout, from what I've been told. Or if you're done doing hay for the day, drive on over to someone's place that isn't done doing hay for the day, cut their grass or something like that. No one snaps a chat. Go fuck your hat. Or couldn't you just help them do hay? But gets a photo. You're gonna need a photo. You wanna know what? No one likes a preachy Patrick, but you are pissing on the seat here. Well, no one likes an impracticals Pete. No one likes an unprepared Paul. Or if you're a woman, no one likes an unproductive Pams. Or an improper Pippa. No one likes a pestering Preston. Or if you're a woman, no one likes a patronizing Peggy. Trust me, good buddies, any charitables act, big or small, is an act wasted if your face ain't attached to it. Any charitable act? Any charitables act. Well, then come on, Dan. Let's drive into town. We'll let the dog drop a shit on Main Street and snap a chat of you picking it up. Good? Pitterpatter! Choice work, super chief. Oh, there's your lipstick. Hey, 19! Nice stats, no stats. Scored 40 genos in the dub, onenine. Sixty apples in the O, 19. Lead the Q in PIMS as an overager, buddy. Wheeled my buddy's billet sister. Fucking 200 PIMS, boys. PIMS 200 club, boys. All the light bulbs don't work on the scoreboard, eh, bud? A quiet night in the red light district, onenine. Suck my knob. Drink milk, onenine. What'd they get in a trade for you, tin of chew and a half a bag of pucks? Set of used practice jerseys? Tub of orange slices? Go carboload, 19. Suck my knob, you plug. Hey, Schmelts. You do not get to talk to Mr. Sakic. Mr. Sakic has earned our respect. You have not earned our respect, Schmelts. You do not get to talk to Mr. Sakic. Your first period in the league, Schmelts. You'll be sent down by the second. This is fantasy camp for you. Hey! You think you can just walk into this league and start chirping? Know your role, pheasants! You had a cup of coffee. You're seat fillers at the ESPY's. You're Tiger's caddy now that nobody gives a shit! It's fucking embarrassing! I don't miss playing for that guy, buddy. Always a silver lining, buddy. Give your balls a tug, you tit fucker! The fuck did Shoresy come from? I didn't even know he was here, bro. Hey. All this time chirping could be better spent doing legs, Schmelts. Never skip leg day, Schmelts. Hey, nice work on legs day today. Hey, you rocked legs today, Yorkie. Thanks. Barts, you're faster than the Russian Rocket, Pavs Bure. That is where leg day got you! Yorkie, statistically, Mike Gartner was faster than Bure, and that's where leg day got you. Let's win it all, Barts. Let's win this ship, Yorkie. So, from now on, you're supposed to call the police when you got worm pickers on the property, and not 911. Good? Now that's the business. Except for that, anything pressing? And she's back to choring. One moment! Or should I say motion. McMurray, how are ya now? Good n' you? Not so bad. Good. I will speak candidly here. Go ahead, baby. Everybody's listening. Everybody loves you. All right. The goings on from last week's emergency meeting left me some terrible upset. Some terrible upset. Oh, yeah, the ass pisses all goddamn week, that's all I know. This is true. I have had the ass pisses, also known as p'zazz. He's been making the weakest cocksucking gin and tonics I ever goddamn had. All of these events combined have brought me to one conclusion. I, McMurray, motion something must be done. Something has to be done. A proper election must take place, whereby both Wayne and I campaign for a week to see who will be president of the Agricultural Hall. I second that motion. I love it when you motion. I love you, too, baby. Your motion. All right. Jimmy Dickskin, do your thing. Dickins. Well, that's exactly what I said. Have at her, Dickskin. All those in favor of a oneweek election period, give me one hand up, can we get a onedollar bill, one hand, we're looking at two. Two hands up, give me two, we're looking at three, three hands up, getting to three. We got three over here, we're looking at four. Four hands up, we're looking at four. Four over here, now we're looking at five. Can I get a fivedollar bill, five over here, now we're looking at six dollar, can I get a six? Six over here, now can I get a. Hands up, baby, hands up! Give me your heart, give me. Sold! Majority rules. Election awarded to McMurray. Get on. Get on. Ride that pony. Ride it. All right.  Oh! Good girl. Good girl. All right, we knew justice would be served. Well, see you next week, big boy. That's a good pinch. You still got the p'zazz? It's not shit, it's a blister from choring. Put her there. Have it as you like. Get your stuff, baby. Let's hit the road. I wouldn't go in there if I was you. Why is she standing outside?  Don't know. Why are you standing outside, Bonnie? They crop dusted inside. We crop dusted inside. Super. I crop dusted on the way over here, too. Did you? I did. Very cool. I know. And you're single. How? I hate everyone. Especially you. Couldn't tell. Oh, no? No. Guess I have work to do then. You don't know what work is. You sure do, entertaining two hockey players at the same time. Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life. Hmm, that's clever. Isn't it? I see what you did there. I smell what you did there. It's clear now, Katy. You can come in. Yeah, why don't you go in, Katy? This has been a lot of fun. Has been? Still is. Oh. Fuck off, is what I meant. We're busy. You're busy? Very. Busy ripping farts in coordinated outfits at the dollar store. What of it? Shut up, Roald. Then what? Are you gonna steal some bikes and ghost ride them into the river? How did she know that? Shut up, Roald. Maybe you could even find a new spot to rip farts in, in coordinated outfits. You know, if you're not too busy. Oh, we have other spots!  Roald! Who's the genius behind these coordinated outfits, anyways? Well, actually if you are interested. Just kidding, I don't give a fuck. Nice to see you, buddy. Don't listen to her, Devon. They wanted you to go to law school. Shut up, Roald! Devon! Devon! How are ya now? Spanking! Not so bad. Are you the creator of Fartbook? I am the sole creator of Fartbook! Cocksucking love that Fartbook, that's all I know. Thank you. Good farts. Now listen, I'm running against Wayne for the presidency of the Ag Hall and was wondering if I could commission you, and him, too, to make us a sort of a campaign video. You are running against Wayne. Cocksucking right, he is. Hurting Wayne hurts Katy. Hurting Katy hurts Stewart. It can be done and it will be done! Make it stop. Make it stop. Okay. Okay. All right. So, look, whatever. Whatever is good. I just wanted to know that we're on the same page, all right? I want it to be a sort of a. Like a good old. Smear campaign. What's that? It's when you run ads suggesting negative things about your opponents. For what purpose? To make yourself look good by making your opponent look bad. Oh, if you got nothing good to say, you shouldn't say nothing at all. You must acknowledge the appetite for negativity in today's world. The misfortune of others, it's become sustenance. You must evolve from your primitive thinking. Do you remember the band Primitive Radio Gods? Had that one really good song? Bet it's on iTunes. I hear McMurray has commissioned Devon et al, to make a video for his campaign. I suggest you follow suit. What sort of video? A spectacle, pure adrenaline, Babylonian. You're spare parts, bud. Tell you what. I'm gonna go into town, mow some lawns. Give people one less chore to do this week. Seems more productive than namecalling. You wanna know what? The dog's in the barn, if you wanna go hurl some insults. You can get your sustenance. He won't know what the fuck you're talking about anyway. Have a good one. Have it your way, shirttucker! (CAR DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) What is Devon up to? I'm Devon, the director. Okay. Brown guy here. Asian woman here. Native man here. Gail. Please. And the whites over there. As you know, the purpose of this cinematic experience is to influence voters. And we'll do that by reaching as many ethnicities as possible with our message about Wayne, which is. He's just not ready. That's good.  Right. He's just not ready to be president of the Ag Hall. Um. There aren't any ethnicities on the Ag Hall board. But there will be. Okay, but why? Because it's 2015. It's not 2015. And just to really hit home this whole ethnicities thing, brown guy, have you ever seen The Simpsons? Yes. Excellent. Need you to talk like Apu, from the KwikEMart? Asian woman, have you ever seen The Karate Kid? Need you to talk like Mr. Miyagi. Wax on! Native man. You're pretty dialed in already. Gail. Where's my money, bitch? Exactly. And our whites are. They're superwhite, so just be yourselves! Thank you. Where is our gay vote? Tad Roald. Tad. Tad Roald! They'd already put cheese on it, but I picked it off. Tad Roald was too shy to be in our video, but said he'd organize our gay vote. So where is our gay vote?  I am so sorry that I'm late, you guys. Crazy story. My bike chain flew right off my bike but I happened to be next to the ice cream truck. So I picked myself up a little sweet treat. Ha. It's hot out today, don't you think, Devon? Whew! My. No, Glen, no. What? Modesty. Mm. Disappointing. Why does he have his underwear on? I don't know. Where's my money, bitch? You spit on me. You're welcome. Hi, Roald. As predicted, Devon's made a video. The song by Primitive Radio Gods is called Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand. And it is on iTunes. Ah, you're not gonna like this one bit. I might like it one drill bit. And the message is you're just not ready. Ah, it doesn't sound so bad. Yes, it does! So I won't like it one bell pepper. Watch! Hmm. Looks like we got good goddamn candidates here, is all I know. Let's talk about Wayne. All right. Under the part that says experience, it doesn't say anything about ever being president of the Agricultural Hall?  Hmm. That's a hard no. He'd be inheriting a lot of problems. Letterkenny problems. He's a farmer. But has anyone ever seen him do any actual work? Ah, hell, no. I hear he's been cutting people's lawns. Like that will stop the grass from growing? Pitterpatter, let's get down to the real issues here. Being President of the Ag Hall is not an entry level job. How are ya now? Not so qualified. Can we really trust a man who can't even be bothered to wear a belt? Hell to the nahnah. He's just not ready. He's just not ready. He's just not ready. He's just not ready. He's just not ready. He's just not ready. Nice hair, though. Nice ass. Hmm. That's what I appreciates about him. He's just not ready!. Wayne for president of the Ag Hall? He's just not ready. Oh, hell no. Hmm. There's a text from your mum. Cream for your anal fissures is in. Wha. It already has 1,001 views. Slightly concerning on account of there only being 5,000 people in Letterkenny. We must respond posthaste. Two wrongs don't make a right. It's jumped 10 views since we've been conversing! 1,011. This thing's going viral. There could be worse things, Stewart. I can beat Devon's view count. I give you my personal guarantee. And when I do, you won't have to sit through McMurray's pointless, purposeless, aimless, godless, motherless, meetings anymore! There's something in it for both of us. Now that's likely the least concerning thing on your hand, isn't it? All actors are present. Wondrous! Why are they here? Money talks. He gave us 50 bucks. It's like cutting twoandahalf lawns. But we don't even wanna be here, boys. You cheated on us, boys. Oh, pipe down, Pete and Repeat. You were both getting blowies from your big city slams the entire time. Dude, who told her about the blowies? Who blew the whistle on the blowies, bro? You just did. Oh, that's gutty, bro. Shut the back door, bro. Reilly and Jonesy, Katy, are here to help us secure the youth vote. There aren't any youth voters on the Ag Hall board. There will be. Why? Because it's 2015! It's not 2015. Now, gentlemen, since you are such crafty vets of the chirpslashbeak slashcarve game, I've decided to let you improvise. We're really good. Yeah. Wayne, let's start with you. Just, um, look directly into the camera and say something slanderous about McMurray. Kind of feels like I should make sure my own backyard's clean before throwing junk in someone else's. He slandered you first. What, so you think if he goes jumps off a bridge, I'm gonna, too? Figure it out. Dan? Daryl? Please help. Reilly! Jonesy! Let's see what you can do. Okay. Warm up? Yeah, warm up. Oh, sure. Absolutely. All right. . The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips. The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips. The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips. The tip of the tongue. Boys! Katy? Girls gone wild. It's not complicated! We want to slander McMurray so Wayne can win the election and I can beat Devon's view count. Now, let's try this. Think about your favorite actor and try to channel them. Who are your favorite actors? Go! Kevin Costner. Keanu Reeves. John Candy. Chloe Sevigny. It's easy. Taylor Kitsch, boys. Big Riggins himself. You picked Big Riggins, so I'll take Michael Fassbender, bro. Yeah. But if. If Big Riggins, if he's not available, 'cause he's my number one, it's easy, Chad Michael Murray, boys. Big Riggins is still my number one but I love Chaz Michael, bro. One Tree Hill! Boom! Go with Michael Fassbender. Try channeling that. Choose Big Riggins. You know what? Actors named Michael could really reinvent themselves if they change their names to Spike, like uh, Spike Fassbenders or, uh, Spike Caine or Spike J. Fox. Spike Buble. Chaz Spike Murray? Oh, C. Spike Murray? Let's try and stay on task! Well, now it might be kind of awkward, might be kind of awkward if actors named Richards started going by Dick. Right? Like Dick Gere. Dick Pryor. Dick Dreyfuss. Lionel Dick. Feel like Richard Simmons probably prefers Dick. Dude, he got fucking mad. Well, looks like she's back to cutting lawns. All those for Wayne resuming presidency of the Ag Hall. Can I get a one vote here? We got one over here. Now can I get a two? Twodollar bill. Two over here now can I get a three. Looking at three, three over here, now can I get a four? Looking for a four. Wayne for President for four? No four. Three for Wayne. Those for McMurray reclaiming presidency of the Ag Hall, can I get a one vote here, looking for onedollar bill. We got one over here, one over here! Now can I get a two, looking for a two, two over here! Now can I get a three, looking at a three? Three over here, we're looking at three, can I get a four, looking for a four. Four over here, now can I get a five? Fivedollar bill, looking for a five. Five over here, now can I get a six? Six dollars, looking for a six, six over here! Now can I get a seven? Seven right here, you can tell by the way he uses his walk he's a woman's man. Sold! Majority rules. Presidency awarded to McMurray. Come on, baby. Come here. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Okay. You gotta act classy. Now you're the First Lady. McMurray, Mrs. McMurray, congratulations. Thanks, Wayne. P'zazz is all cleared up and everything. I'm back to my old self again. Glad to hear. Best of luck. Appreciate it. Let's go get a couple of cocksucking G&Ts, that's what I always say. Okay, girl, let's do it. Sorry, I couldn't vote for you, Wayne. Your video really threw me off. Thanks for cutting my lawn, though. I'll return the favor one day. Good enough, Jim. Stewart's YouTube page. McMurray's a piece of shit. McMurray's a piece of shit. McMurray's a piece of shit? Why would I say McMurray's a piece of shit? All right, he's a piece of shit. Hello? Yo. What's up, B? Nothing. Chilling. What's up with you? McMurray's a piece of shit. True. What's up? What up? Yo, who's that? Yo, pick up the phone. What up? What's up? What up?. What up?. Ahh. McMurray's a piece of shit. McMurray's a piece of shit. Message approved by Wayne. Fuck a duck. I mean, this is no fun, boys. Team NoFun, boys. We gotta start giving it back to them or they're just gonna fucking walk all over us, buddy. Yeah, but where do we start, buddy? What the fuck is that, boys? Yo, you leave the house like that, buddy? What's the problem, Schmelt? You got a fucking bush, bud. You got a bush, bud. Who's the bush inspector around here, boys? Bush inspector's sleeping on shift, boys. On our junior team it's a fivedollar fine every game and praccy 'til she's shaved down to the wood, boys. Hey, get that hedge hog off your tummy stick, bud. You're fucking gross, bud. You're fucking gross, bud. Looks like we got a couple of cocklookers, Yorkie. Of course, the Schmelts like a good cocklook, Barts. Oh, yeah, I fucking cocklooked 'cause your junk's a fucking car crash and you can't look away. I cocklooked 'cause your junk's a fucking strobe light. I can see it with my eyes closed! So you were cocklooking. They just admitted they cocklooked. Well, I cocklooked 'cause your junk's a fucking welding flame, buddy. You look directly at it and your fucking retinas getting burned. I cocklooked because your junk's a fucking child walking in on his parents. Once you see it, it cannot be unseen. All this time cocklooking could be better spent doing legs. More legs, less cocklooking, Schmelts. I fucking skipped leg day, boys. Fuck leg day, boys! You are woefully uninformed, aren't you? How? I said I would beat Devon's view count, not win you the election. And guess what? I did beat Devon's view count. Look. Oh, I don't give a care. I've been contacted by Budweiser and Carl's Jr. over copyright infringements, but I don't think they're serious. You wanna know what? McMurray's meetings are a bit painful, but not sure that's good enough reason to get into politics. They're all crooks. Every one of them. Now run along, Stewart, before I get bored of behaving. Well, I guess she's off to chore. Been busy cutting other people's fucking lawns all week. Jim Dickins. How're ya now? It's Dicks. Nope, you got it right that time. Good n' you? Not so bad. I said I'd return the favor for cutting the lawn. I figured there's no time like the present. Can we give you a hand with anything?You're having thirsty Thursday with your pals the other day. It was my cousin's sixth birthday party yesterday. Which cousin? Samuel. I fuckin' hate Samuel. Well, Samuel likes you. Fuckin' hate Samuel so much. Well, Samuel's not so bad. I seen Samuel in the laundry room with the cat one time. You just know that little fucker's gonna put him in the dryer. That's a hasty conclusion. Not if you seen Samuel trying to put himself in there 15 minutes earlier. I seen Samuel snort a line of Fun Dip on his fifth birthday. Well, it's reason fuckin' five million I didn't go to his sixth birthday party. He was doing a Fun Dip dry rip. A what? Or rippsin' a Fun Dip dry one. Well, what's that? Well, in schneef terms, if you do a line of schneef before you've ingested any booze to alter your judgment, it's called doing a dry rip. Or rippsin' a dry one. Doin' dry rips is a pretty good indication you got a schneef problem. You got yourselves a schneef issue. Well, yous ever done a dry rip? Well, back in the day. In the glory days. Yeah, I done a dry rip. I'd a rips a dry one. Not sure if rippin' a Fun dip dry rip would have the same effect, but doin' it is still a pretty good indication you got some sort of problem. Well, hoopin' Fun Dip definitely wouldn't have the same effects, but it's definitely an indication you got yourselves a problem. Well, what's hoopin'? Well, that's instead of taking the drugs orally's or intranasally's, you take 'em anally's. What the fuck you talking about now? Well, instead of down the hatch or up the nose, you take 'em in the pooper. Wait, you put drugs up your pooper? That's the fastest way to absorbs 'em into your systems. Do you mean like you take the drugs with your hand. Well, then you put 'em up your pooper? Correct. But you don't poop 'em out? No, your pooper absorbs 'em. Well, isn't that curious. Hoopin' Fun Dip definitely wouldn't have the same effect as hoopin' schneef. But doing it is still probably a pretty good indication you got some sort of a problem. I guess a Fun Dip dick dinger wouldn't be the ends of the world. You wanna know what? I heard my friends J. P. and J. W. talk about Fun Dip dick dingers one time. Well, whose dick was gettin' dinged? Well, I thought it was a bit intrusive to ask whose dick was gettin' dinged. As long as they're both consentin' adults, it really doesn't matter whose dick's gettin' dinged. Well, I really hope the Fun Dip candy stick isn't going to waste in all this. Do you wanna know what? I pulled my first allnighter with my friend Chad in grade eight playing Pokemans and eating Fun Dip. Oh, waits. If. If Samuel's already been takin' Fun Dips orally's and intranasally's. Yeah, we should probably go check on Samuel. I fuckin' hate Samuel so much. You got any dates lined up this week, good buddy? Nah, I'm gonna put that bullshit on the back burner for a bit, bud. Soft, literally. Parks 'er behind the barn for a bits? Tenply. No. Gotta find Stormy a stud. That's a priority. She's a beautiful dog. Oh, she's a real beauty. No, she's a gorgeous dog. She just tries to kill her studs, is the thing. Well, that's my girl. Maybe you should takes her in for a fingers in the bum. Are you fuckin' preoccupied? That's only the answer sometimes. Squirrelly Dan working' Squirrelly OT. Not all the time. Just to checks. Sometimes. Are you fuckin' preoccupied? Doesn't matter what you takes her in for. As sure as a bush is gonna break your fall, Stormy's gonna get some fingers in the bum. How deep? Fuck's sake. What do ya means, how deep? How many knuckles? Like how many knuckles deep? Yeah, are we talking about a oneknuckler or a twoknuckler? Oh, be at least a threeknuckler to gets to the bottom of this. Oh, see, now, that's too many. Is not. Well, a person's got two knuckles so you're saying that the vet would have to fire a threeknuckler up Stormy's bum to get to the bottom of it? A person has three knuckles. Well, a person has two knuckles. Figure it out. A person has three knuckles. You figure it out. A person's got two knuckles, okay? One, two. Three. You forgots about the little knuckles underneath the fingernails. Well, see now, that's not a knuckle, though, Dan. To be a knuckle, you gotta be able to punch somebody with it. You can't punch somebody with the knuckle underneath the fingernail, can you? Can too. Well, you'll be looking pretty fuckin' silly. First knuckle, one knuckler. Second knuckle, twoknuckler. Third knuckle, threeknuckler. So then by your logic the vet would have to fire a full finger up Stormy's bum to get to the bottom of it. Correct. See, I'm just not so goddamn sure I can stand by and watch the vet give Stormy a threeknuckler up the bum. No, I don't think Stormy would need a threeknuckler up the bum. Well, thank you, Dary, because then you'd think the vet's a bit funny, would you not? Mmm, a person has three knuckles, though. Thank you, Dary. Fuck's sake, go ahead and have a fuckin' fight with your first knuckle then. You'll be lookin' pretty fuckin' silly. Yeah, but when we're talkin' about a twoknuckler, we're talking about horizontal knuckles. I'm gonna stop you there. By your logic, a sixknuckler can be dealt with using these two fingers? Correct. Incorrect. No such thing as a sixknuckler. A sixknuckler existed, I'd know about it. How are ya now, Gail? Good, and you? Not so bad. Got a stud for Stormy. Comes from the Baumgartner breeders. Name's Ken. Ken Baumgartner? Yeah. Okay. You're not exposed to give dogs human names. Can do what I want. Well, sure you can, I'm just sayin' you're not exposed to. Baumgartner's been breeding German Shepherds out in Chemmy for six years. Champion bloodlines. Elegance. Strength. Raw food diet. You got him in the truck? Yeah. Well, pull around back. See if they'll have a go. Okay. Hey, Dan. Do you wanna know how I know about a sixknuckler? Okay. Reilly. Jonesy. You guys been gettin' a lot of ice time? Well, actually.  I'm just kiddin'. I don't give a fuck. I stepped down from your old junior team. Turns out the senior team needed a new bench boss. Real work to be done here. Real men. Turns out you guys have been havin' a bit of a cake walk up here, huh? Is that right, Reilly? Eh, a little angel cake? A little angel food cake with a top glaze? Huh? Have your mom mix up the egg whites and the vanilla? Huh? Have your mom cut it with a knife or a small spatula through the batter releasing air bubbles and bake? Light as air? Huh? Virtually fatfree? Fuck you, pheasant! Come on, man. Oh, Jonesy's got something to say. What kind of cake are you walkin', huh? A little Lady Baltimore? Huh? A little date and walnut loaf? A little Napoleonshatte? Coach, it's not that we're. Cake walk's over, all right, Johnny Cheechoo and Chuck Huddy? Gonna have the boys tossing up sueys up the middle all night, just tossing up hot suey sauce? You know why?. 'Cause you've been skipped leg day? You think you can skirt legs and crack the Czech Extraliga? Huh? You couldn't even crack the HockeyAllsvenska, let alone the Deutsche Eishockey Liga! Fuck! You plugs are gonna learn some jam. It is fuckin' embarrassing! I'm sick of playing' hurt, buddy. Are you hurt or are you injured, buddy? This time it's different. My feelings are hurt. No, feelings are injured, bro. I wanna dust on praccy. No praccy means no game, buddy. I know. I wanna dust on praccy, too. What do we do? Crush a couple sandos? I don't think I could crush a sando right now. But you love crushin' sandos, bro. I know. I'm fuckin' terrified. Me too. Hey. Hey. It's okay. Thanks, buddy. (HIPHOP SONG PLAYING) I'm here for a normal reason. Okay, but sure it's this? Yeah, it's all cued up. And this is their best song? It is. Well, it's the one he knows. Oh. If it fails, it's on you. What? Hey, we got, uh. We got Digable Planets all cued up for you, Stewart. I'm more into Shabazz Palaces right now. Uh, we don't have them. What about Busdriver? Milo? Open Mike Eagle? You love those guys. Hmm? Have any Freddie Gibbs? Vince Staples? It's darker. Young Thug?  Don't act like anyone knows what he's saying, Devon. I've got an idea. Danny Brown. Cue it up. Cue it up. Cue it up. Cue it up. Okay. This gets worse before it gets better, cowboy. Did she. Stormy tried to kill Ken Baumgartner. Well, that's my girl. The Baumgartners aren't gonna be too jazzed about this. Guess we could try his brother Nolan. Nolan Baumgartner? Yeah. Okay. No more Baumgartners. It's not the Baumgartners. It's Stormy. Fuckin' shithead! Gail. She's a shithead and I'll fuckin' say it to her face. I'll say it to fuckin' your face. Fuckin' rip open her face, take out her eye sockets, get right in there and tell it to her fuckin' frontal lobe. Fuck! Fuck! It's too nice a day to get cross. You should try a sedative. What? Are you kiddin' me? God. Oh, my. Oh, this is what we were talkin' about in my women's studies class right here. Let's have a fuckin' field day with this bullshit, that's for goddamn sure. Fuckin' patriarchy. Professor Tricia would literally shit a brick! What's wrong with you? I'm very upset. Sort yourself out. Gail just said she wants to roofie Stormy. No, I didn't. Doesn't sound like she did. If you want to give Stormy drugs to the point of impairments so that Ken Baumgartners can have his filthy sex with her, well, then, that is.  Don't say it. We get it. What about Nolan Baumgartner? Okay, you think I wanna carpet Stormy? Yeah. Sounds to me like you wants to rope her. What the actual fuck are you two talkin' about? Carpet and rope are slang for roofies. Every drug has, like, a million different words. Name one. Marijuana. Dutch. Keef. Dank. Assassin of youth. K. Name another. Cocaine. Uptown. Nose beers. Booger sugar. Stripper salt. Outstanding. Name another. No, I get it. MDMA. And don't say Molly. Who's that? Bombers. Hug drug. Mmm, little fellows. EBaums world. Mushrooms. Zoomers. Boomers. Cracker stackers. Simple Simon.  Better not call me Simple Simon, I'll tell you where to go. Fuck, yeah. I've got another stud for Stormy. Fuck you. Give me half hour. Well, I'll go run 'er. Might help. Little exercise. Discipline and affection in that order. Hey, Dan, do you know another name for Ecstasy is Dancin' Shoes? 'Cause it makes me wanna dance. Makes me wanna hug. I get real huggy when I'm on the ecstasy's. Ecstasy bear. Somethin' about that drug, you know. You just wanna reach around and enjoy the tactile sensations that make up this fabulous world. Wide worldy bear. Yeah, just. Just wanna hold people. Okay, how can I help? Rock bottom, boys. Rock bottom, ferda. Ferda. Boys, do you know I think that there is a reason why you found me. Well, yeah, I mean, you were waiting for us. Kinda right by the door. Okay, I think there's a reason. .that y'all found me, okay? You found me because you need guidance. You're. You're lost. Nowhere to turn. And do you know what I say to those who need guidance? Do you know what I say to those who are lost? Who have nowhere to turn? I say turn to him. Turn to who? God. Can't we just talk to you, buddy? Yeah. Talk to God. Why do we have to talk to God? Why can't we just talk to you? You're right here. Well, I. I understand but we're all saying the same thing. I'm here, I'm the one. I'm a conduit. I'm the one that. I'm the messenger that. Talk to me. I'm your spiritual counselor, okay? You can talk to me. Thanks, buddy. Sick, buddy. All right. So, I think to get to the root of your problem we need to figure out here, together, where did it begin? Sick, buddy. Sick. Boys, where did it all begin? What? Oh, do you mean when? No. Yes, actually. Yes. Thanks. Surprise. When, when did the problem start? Oh, um. When. When we lost. She we do not speak of. Ooh, Katy? No. Yes. Just, we do not speak of her. Then, yes, but, buddy, we're talking about her right now so. We're speaking of her to try to make it so she isn't she we do not speak about anymore. Yeah, I know, but is that even okay, buddy? Oh, my God. Yes. It's fine. It's fine. It's okay. It's okay. I want you to think about this. I want you to hear this and I want you to think about it. I want you to think about how many fish there are in the sea, 'cause there's a lot of them. A lot of fish in the sea and there's a lot of fish on menus and most often good restaurants have a lot of fish on them. And I want you to think, Look at this menu. Have I tried all this fish? Have I thought, do I want fish? Oh, what's this? Oh, this is a shellfish. That looks like calamari, I wanna try that. Oh, you mean like our big city slams? I guess we could call up our big city slams, bro. I didn't. I didn't mean that at all, but fine. Do whatever you want. Big city slams, ferda. Ferda! Hey, it's never gonna make sense to me. Where are you going? He has the car. See? I told you. It's his. Worth it. I gagged. Gail, how are ya now? Good, and you? Not so bad.  You gotta rich inner life. Boy, howdy. Got another stud for Stormy. Comes from the Buchburger breeders. Name's Kelly. Kelly Buchburger? Yeah. Okay. The Buchburgers have been breedin' German Shepherds out in Arva for 16 years. They're outgoin'. Strong. And heavyboned.  So he's in the truck? Yeah. Well, pull around back, we'll see if they'll have a go. Gotta say, Wayne, if it doesn't work out with Kelly Buchburger, you're approaching the bottom of the well. Oh, bother. I was sure you had a winner in Ken Baumgartner. You could always use his brother, Nolan Baumgartner. If you don't want to sedate. I've had just abouts enough of that talks, Gail. If you're past a knuckle or two up the bum. It'd take three knuckles to gets to the bottom of this. I'd say Stormy's just not fit for breedin'. But she's a beautiful dog. She's such a beautiful dog. A real beauty. She's a gorgeous dog. Yeah, but she keeps on tryin' to kill her studs. Well. PitterPatter. My Instagram is just blowing up. Oh, my goodness. Oh! Yes, Katy. To be clear, I wanna sign you. So you're gonna call me, right, even if it's just to talk? I am gonna lay everything out for you. All your pretty options. We're gonna start with a tour of the office. Maybe a lowcal lunch. But you have to come to the city. I really can't do anything here in Letterkenny. So you're gonna call me, right? Yes. Awesome. Cool. Talk soon. Okay? Okay. Hey, KatyKat? Hey, Katy?  Big city slams, boys. Big city slams, boys. Gail, how are ya now? Good, and you? Not so bad. Got the perfect stud for Stormy. My cousin up in Tobermory will be here with him later. This dog is different. Strong, silent type. Hard worker. No bullshit. Fuck, I'd do him. Sounds like a good guy. Sounds like a real good guy. Probably a real good guy. This is the one, cowboy. Okay. You can trust this old goat. So your cousin's coming up later with the stud? Yeah. What are we gonna do till then? Ah, you're fuckin' lookin' at it, super chief. Well, you know, back in the day. Back in the glory days. We'd hoover some schneef. You wanna know what? I feel like yous been working your way towards this for about six weeks. It's been a long, long time since I've hoovered some schneef. 'Cause you were a fuckin' degen when you did, Dan. I was skinny. And here's another thing. You shouldn't call it schneef anymore. I think you should call it schniff. Why? 'Cause it's funnier. I think. It's kinda like that word queef. See, you can have a lot of fun with that word queef. But what's funnier, well, I think, is the word quiff. I could hoover a bit of schneef. Schniff. You ever hoovered backseat schneef? Schniff! I've hoovered schneef off of the headrest of a Pontiac Tracer traveling to SARSfest. Ever hoovered backstage schneef? I've hoovered schneef off of Jann Arden's charcuterie board. I'd have a beer. You ever hoovered boat schneef?. Schniff! I've hoovered schneef off of Theodore Tugboat's baseball cap. I got the NES out for you. What happened to the 64? Six hours Mario Kart. Six hours Diddy Kong Racing. Have I been sleeping that long? He did melatonin dry rips. You did melatonin dry rips? Did you play GoldenEye? Pointless. Everyone has the multiplayer maps memorized. What's on NES? We beat Mario 1. Almost done Mario 3. What about Mario 2? That's it? Desist? You are amiss. Super Mario Brothers 2? What kind of dismantled, bemused, lugubrious motherfucker wants to play that, Stewart? I'm sad, Devon. I know. Do what you must. I will. We will. You will? Mmmhmm. We need you back at one hundred. One hunnid. Zero to one hunnid? Real quick. So? We will get her back. Roald? That better be the duck hunter gun in your pocket. It's called an NES zapper. But, no. I miss Katy, buddy. I miss KatyKat in a big way, buddy. Where have you been for the past four and a half minutes, boys? Gettin' blowies. I just got a squeezer, but still. Ferda. Okay, boys. If I'm Katy, I don't wanna date you. Bro. Bro. Just saying. And if I'm Wayne. I don't. I don't want you dating my sister. I think I know what he means, buddy. But ya don't. I think I get it, bro. You definitely don't. We need to go through Wayne to get to Katy. Okay, I can work with that. Maybe we're on to something. We need to beat the shit out of Wayne to get to Katy? Okay, you don't. You lost me again. Beat the shit outta Wayne, ferda KatyKat. Ferda KatyKat. And. None of it, none of it makes sense. Lord, I tried. I tried. Lord. Lord knows I tried! Ah, there will be no peace in Letterkenny. No, sir. Satan has secured his estate. Thousands below the asking price. Our Father, who art in heaven. Hallowed by Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not unto temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. You ever hoovered police station schneef? I've hoovered schneef off a sergeant constable's nightstick. You should call it schniff. Ever hoovered airport schneef? I've hoovered schneef off a Drakkar Noir display at the hors taxes. Well, suit yourselves. My cousin should be here any minute. It's fuckin' tilly time, boys! Go time! Go grab a rake and tidy that gravel you've upset. Are you fuckin' deaf, hick? Let's have a donnybrook! That tone's unhelpful. Tarps off? Sheddin' the tarp. Now, as I recall, that's your ritual before a fight, and my patience is wearing thin, so I'll ask. Are you fuckin' high? No. No. We want Katy back. We'll go through you to get her. Unnecessary as of five minutes ago but as of right this second, you should make sure your shoelaces are tight. Bye, Katy. What does that have to do with anything? What? Air! Ramped! Fire! I've come to reclaim the Lady Katy. Fuck you, pheasant! We've been waitin' a long time to fight you, pheasy? We're ready to defend. So there's a line? If so. I'm budgin'. We should breakdance fight. It's safer. And I'll win. Too much talkin'. Shall we? Oh, shit, I actually do need to tie my shoelaces. What the fuck? Let's get at it! Wayne, this is my cousin. What's your cousin's name, Gail? Rosie. Rosie, how are ya now? Good, and you? I'm not so bad. Should I pull around back and see if they'll have a go? Couldn't have said it better myself. PitterPatter. Wayne? Yeah? I want you back. Oh. Wayne. Yeah? I'm pregnant. Oh. Oh, fuck. You ran out of beers with your pals the other day. What do ya have, some kind of drinking problem? What's the problem, Dan? That's alcohol's abuse. Well, to be fair. Oh, don't say to be fair. I hate when people say to be fair. It sounds like, To be faiuh. To be faiuh. Well, to be faiuh. The bottom inch of a beer bottle is 50% spit. Well, don't be gross. Bugs could have crawled down there and died, too. You don't know. What'd I just say? Well, it's the same reason you don't eat the bottom of an ice cream cone. Not sure how I feels about this talk. What, do you think they check for bugs down there in the cone factory? Fuck, no. They just throw the cones in the box. Figure it out. Can we move past this, please? What, do ya think they check for bugs down there at the cone shop? Fuck, no. They just throw the ice cream on there. Have a good one. This conversation's fast becoming a confrontation. Like, here, have some ice cream and fucking bugs, likely. What do you do with the bottoms of the ice cream cones? Well, you throw it on the fucking ground, Dan. You let the bugs eat it. It's the circle of life. Didn't you never see The Lion King? You know I love The Lion King. We're out of beer. No. No. Beer store's closed. Fuck, do I miss MoDean's. Reason fucking five million we need some sort of bar in this town. Green, blue, and gold? I don't like where this is headed. Yeah, it's the leftovers from the Christmas potluck. We haven't had that in years. A half dozen at least. Well, a half baker's, but that's splitting hairs. Creme de menthe, Blue Curacao, Butter Ripple Schnapps. Now, what the fuck am I supposed to do with creme de menthe? Splash of milk, with three scoops of chocolate ice cream, you got yourself a Frozen Girl Scout. Do I look like the type of prick to have a Frozen Girl Scout, Dary? What am I supposed to do with Blue Curacao? Mix apple juice, pear juice, garnish with blackberries, you got yourself a Blue Bijou. I think I'd rather have a Blue Bijou. There's not enough for two. Says you. Well, what am I supposed to do with Butter Ripple Schnapps? Well, that's easy, KatyKat. Down the hatch. I'd be tasting that for days. What's the meaning of this? I found it in an old golf bag. And why do you get it? It's warm. It's still a beer. Well, to be fair. To be faiuh. To be faiuh. To be faiuh. To be faiuh. He is essentially drinking a bottle of piss right now. Now, you're no mixologist but your best bet here is to mix 'em all together into what you call donkey juice. However, to be faiuh, donkey juice will make you spit. Well, can't win 'em all. Uncle Eddie died. Did he? Dumdiddydo. Well, you can't win 'em all. Mr. Letterkenny himself. Longeststanding mayor in the history of Letterkenny. And you know that snowbird enjoyed the homestretch in Fort Lauderdale. Oh, yeah, just hanging out down there playing crokinole and shuffleboard with his good pals. He was a good guy. He was a real good guy. He left us a bunch of money. Did he? Dumdiddydo. How much? Five K. What a great fucking guy. He was a real great fucking guy. Well, he'd want us to have a party. He wants us to put it back into the community. What a great fucking guy! He says in his will that he's fallen out of touch with the community and he trusts our judgment to give five K some legs around here. Well, sure as God's got sandals. So, how do you want to fuck this pig? Well, you'd better put it on your fucking Facebook. PitterPatter. Let's get at 'er. (HIPHOP MUSIC PLAYING) Faster than shit through a goose. Licketysplit. You've entered the barn, where ideas come to blossom or be ridiculed relentlessly. On one side, two nononsense farmers are looking to give away their uncle's money. On the other, savvy entrepreneurs hoping to acquire it. First up, three degens from Letterkenny are hoping to sell the farmers on their solution for a common smalltown problem. Hi, Bonnie. Hi, Katy. Hi, Wayne. How are ya now? Good and you? Not so bad. Say, thanks for the, uh. Well, the thing you did there. No problem, Wayne. Any time. Good afternoon, hicks. We are asking for. Is it true that you have a massive horn? Yes. No. No?  I mean, there's no way that they could possibly know that. I saw Stewart's penis at the Elmira pool on my 11th birthday. Looked like a 12ounce cut of pork tenderloin hanging there. Erroneous. I saw Stewart's penis when we touched tubes, as normal, inquisitive, young boys do, and it looked six pool balls were stuck inside a gym sock, hanging there. Unverified. Told ya. Fuck! We are asking for five K for 66.6% of our company. Outstanding. We want to give back to the community by helping people get sober. Uncle Eddie got sober as a birthday present to himself on his 90th. Which was curious, 'cause he'd come that far, right? I should say. And we plan on doing this by getting the biggest disasters in Letterkenny, and putting them in a room with cameras. From there, we film their friends and family telling them they must halt said disastery, posthaste! Is disastery a word? It's a band name. Quantifiable. Want to know what? It feels like I might have seen something like this on a TV show one time. We've arranged a demo of how this might work. We have? Stewart, you are such a disastery that sometimes you don't even know if it's a weekday or the weekend. It hurts me to see you being such a disaster. I wish you could go back to being only a mild disaster. Love, Devon. This antic was not discussed or rehearsed. Stewart, I worry that your disastery is the result of when we touched tubes as young boys. I think about touching tubes with you and sometimes wish I could go back in time and not touch tubes. Perhaps had we not touched tubes, you wouldn't be such a disaster. Love, Roald. Drollery was to be left on the cuttingroom floor. Anywho. Your idea comes from a good place, but Uncle Eddie always believed that if a man needs help, he'll ask. He won't be told. And for that reason, I'm out. Sounds like touching tubes was a pretty big setback for Stewart, but your pitch was the real disaster. I'm out. So, do we win? No. No. Up next in the barn, these winners of the genetic lottery with no more than an ounce of gray matter between them, hope the farmers get behind their plan for young people in Letterkenny. So, are you just going to do that every time, then, Bonnie? Well, if you want me to, Wayne. Yes, please. You got it, Wayne. Thank you. Good afternoon, Wayne, and shewedonotspeakof. Oh, piss off. You both took down your team's student trainer on her kinesiology coop. How'd she find out about. Shh! There's hope for you yet, boys. We are here asking for five K for 49% of our company. Super. We want to give back to the community by investing in the youth, boys. Really hustle for the youth, boys. Uncle Eddie loved kids. His only shortcoming, really. We want to take the toughest youth in Letterkenny and put them into a house together, with a gym and with a pool. There, they'll work out together while receiving instructions from coaches, Joint Boy and Tyson. They will then fight each other one by one to find out who is, in fact, the toughest kid in Letterkenny. This concept sounds a bit familiar. No, it's a fresh concept, ferda. Ferda fresh. Well, I'm trying to wrap my head around this, so I've got a few questions, here. So, you want to put a bunch of dudes in a house together? Yes. They'll be wearing only gym shorts, as you can see in the poster. And then you'll have all these dudes work out together? Yes, and they'll always be shirtless 'cause there's no AC. It's hot. Then when all these dudes are done working out together, they can go swimming together? Oh, we'll teach them how to wrestle, too. Hold downs, full mount, top control. Throw some booze in the house. They can have a drink together. What are you really trying to accomplish here, boys?. Great presentation. I really love the bulletin board with all the sweaty dudes. You can just leave that here. But I don't think that Uncle Eddie would say, Katy, great investment in sweaty dudes. And for that reason, I'm out. You want to know what? I'm just going to come right out and say it, and you can take that bulletin board with you, please and thanks. This idea's a tad fruityloops. And for that reason, oh, I'm out. What?. Up next in the barn, this bartender turned dogbreeder hopes Cupid will find his way to Letterkenny. Say, Bonnie, could I get you anything? A glass of water, or. I'm okay, Wayne. Thanks, though. Well, if you change your mind, you can just run to the house there, help yourself. Maybe I will run over then. Can I get you anything? Well, no, I'm okay. Do you want anything from the. Hmm. Wet your whistle. No, I'm good. I got some water. Okay. No, we're okay. Thank you, Bonnie. Cool, Wayne. Good afternoon, Wayne, Katy. Gail, how are you now? Good, and you? Well, not so bad. I'm asking for five K for 69% of my company. Why 69? Both sides benefit. Good enough. I want to give back to the community by helping people find love. Uncle Eddie was a notorious matchmaker. And a real fucking legend on the D floor right up till the bitter end. Yeah. And I plan on doing that by putting 20 women from Letterkenny into a house with you, and having 'em all compete for your hand in marriage. Who, me? Yeah. Well, get after it. Isn't this already a reality series? If it is, no one watches it. Well, I'd fucking watch it, boy howdy. I'll have the girls perform campy tasks and complete silly challenges to prove their mettle. Well, that sounds fun. Unnecessary, but go on. Then you'd go on group dates with them and oneonone dates with them. And then you ax them one by one until you decide which one you want to marry. Okay. I'm not sure it's reasonable that he could choose a wife based just on that. I know. Tastes good, but where's the cream filling? Like a Boston cream? Canadian maple's better. Well, that's a Texassized 104. Here's the kicker. When it gets down to the final three girls, deal is, you get to go to their houses and meet their families. See? Now that's reasonable. And then you get to spend a night with each of them, until you decide which one you want to marry. Is that. Does she. With all three? Does she mean. After the. Well, maybe it means that I would have to. I don't want to talk about it, just ask her. Okay, I'll ask her. You want to know what? I got some fucking questions here. Shaboink! Now, when you say I spend the night with three of them, is it implied I have sex with all three of them? Sure is. So, I meet their families. Then we go have sex. I do that with three of them, before deciding which one I want to marry? Yeah. And do the girls know going into the process that I will be having sex with them and two other girls before deciding which one I want to marry? Yeah. Maybe more. And do the girls' families, who I've just met, also know, going into the process, that I will be having sex with their daughters, as well as two other girls who are not their daughters, before deciding which one I want to marry? Yeah. And the girls, and their families, find this process entirely rational, despite how selfharming, healthhazardous, and humiliating it very likely will be? Yeah. And do you say 20 girls, and their families will happily sign up for this process? Over and over, I imagine. Oh, Gail, I don't want to date a girl like that, for fuck's sake. Comes from a family like that. Fuck. Gail, could there be a female version where there's one girl and 20 dudes? Yeah. I'm in. No! Ew! You're out. And do you want to know what? What? I'm out. Okay. Up next in the barn, this husband and wife pair from RR2 Letterkenny wants to go hunting for buried treasure. Bonnie! Bonnie! Did ya feed the dog? Yes! Oh, well, thank you. Jim Dickins, how are you now? Good, and you? Oh, not so bad. McMurray, how are. Wayne, how are. Well, good. Well, I'm good and. I'm not so. Oh, not so. Uh. Not so bad. Go ahead. You, you were first so. No, why don't you go ahead? Oh, I didn't want to be impolite. Just start talking, please, McMurray. So you can go ahead and start. If you're going to go first, then it would be your turn. Just pretend what I had to say wasn't important. You're here to pitch, are you not? Are you sure you don't want to say anything? Jesus, PitterPatter, McMurray! Good enough. Have at 'er. Yip, yip, yip. Now, we are asking for five K for 5% of our business. Okay. We want to give back to the community by helping them cocksuckers get rich. Uncle Eddie used to buy lottery tickets for the seniors at the home every week. MRS. And we want to goddamn do that by auctioning off other people's shit. Bingo. Did you know that there are storage facilities surrounding Letterkenny that are filled with other people's useless piles of their shit, that they have forgotten about? Abandoned it, baby. They abandoned their shit. Abandoned their shit. Now, whose knob do I got to polish to get a cocksucking gin and tonic around here? All right. We have secured the auctioneering right for these such storage facilities with the help of our friend, Jimmy Dickskin. Dickins. That's exactly what I said. So, what we want to do is we want to take people down there and have them rummage through all the shit and then buy some of the stuff and probably, more than likely, most definitely, find hidden treasures, gold and jewels. And I'd settle for a Tom Collins, if it'll get this rig rolling. So, you want to sell other people's shit that they left in their storage locker. Abandoned. Abandoned. Things that they abandoned. But it's a storage locker and nobody's got any good shit in there. You would be surprised. I'm never surprised. Well, you will be once we show you a demonstration of one such storage locker that we have brought down from the tiny town of Tiverton. Baby, if you will. Shall I call you Vanna, for a little roleplay? Uhhuh, baby, you know what I mean? All right, and a one, and a two, and a three, Jimmy Dickskin! Got a beautiful set of DVDs. To start the bidding. DVDs galore, look at that.  One, two, three, four, five. That's $50 guaranteed for sure for DVDs alone. Then we got a VCR. That's a vintage VCR. Guaranteed $50 for that sweet piece of machinery right then and there. Maybe 100, maybe 150. No big problem. What else have we got, baby? Fishing lures. What man doesn't want 'em? What man doesn't need 'em? What man doesn't throw fishing lures all over the goddamn place? Hundreds by the thousands. Five dollars a fishing lure guaranteeing it for fucking sure. So, you got five, probably times 100, probably $5,000 right there, sitting alone in that box. That microwave was probably touched by Mahatma Gandhi. Easy! Maybe even Jesus. The proper thing, I guarantee ya, is worth $100,000, no problem. A bit generous on your evaluations there, bud. All right, 100,000 might be too much, but maybe 50,000. What have we got now, baby? Looks like we got a handyman storage locker, baby.  Handyman storage.  We got corn silk white. We got lavender brush white paint. We got.  Mint. Mint cream white paint! You can cream all over the place! All over your ceilings! You can do them! Come in here and buy all of that paint and paint your apartment and give you $100 cash in your hands. Ya hear me? What else we got, baby? And now we're talking big money. We got the bits. We got bits. Bits coming out of the ass. Twist bits, drill bits, fucking Brad bits. All over the place. Baby's putting them in. Gonna have so many bits, you can put 'em in your tits. You can put in your mouth, you can shake 'em all around, do a little dance, and all kinds of shit. Bits all over the place. You can have so many, you can lick 'em, suck 'em, kick 'em fucking right in. Not for me, though, but somebody else who's into that kind of shit. Each one is guaranteed to be at least $100. No problem there, for sure. $100 each bit! No, they're not. Sure God damn are! No, they're not. Jimmy Dickskin! Dickins! I know it's Dickins, and I meant no offense. I was just trying to get you to stop the. Well, the thing you're doing. No one keeps shit in their storage locker that you can rich off of. Only shit like Brad point bits, really. Yep, see. Uncle Eddie would have wanted me to take this idea and put it in a storage locker, then abandon it. I'm out! You want to know what? Whoever called it the Brad point bit would have done themselves a favor by calling it the Brad Pitt bit. But either way I'm out. That's marketing genius right there, Wayne, but you snooze, you lose, buggers. You're looking at three millionaires walking away from ya in the dust. Have a good day! On the morrow!. Up next in the barn, this southern evangelist turned Letterkenny youth worker brings the sound of music. Bonnie, where'd you get your dress? I don't know. It was a Christmas present. Can you find out? I think so. It's so cute. Thank you. You're welcome. Do you like it, Wayne? Glen, how're you now? Oh, good and you? Not so bad. Well, I want your five K. For what percent? Uh, at 0%. That's the Lord's percentage. Oh, is that what it is? Yes. Now, what I would like to do, is to give back to the community by spreading the word of Christ. Okay .through song! Uncle Eddie was an atheist. Well. Then he couldn't have been a Boy Scout because atheism violates our pledge. You're a Boy Scout? Uh, yeah. Fastest Boy Scout to ever earn his badges in basketing and buglery. Hey, ya ever had a Frozen Girl Scout? Yes! But with three scoops of chocolate gelato instead of ice cream. I'm proudly lactose intolerant. So am I, but you can power through that if you really want to. Wayne! I'd like to introduce you to Milo, Levi, and Finn. Those sound like stage names. Oh, they are. Their actual names are Kennedy, Cullen, Campbell. Those sound like last names. They are. Now I would like to take these boys to Los Angeles to audition for a little show you might have heard of, called America's Got Talent. Now, I know what you're thinking. Why can't you just bring 'em to the local model search and talent show that's coming to town soon? Well, I would prefer to bring them directly to the epicenter of everything. Make 'em superfamous and then inspire loads of other boys, all over Letterkenny, to sing. What do ya sing? Oh, we sing Enya. We sing Enyathing. It's a choir joke. Anywho, I'm their choirmaster but I consider myself to be more of a. A playercoach in the equationatto. Because, I mean, frankly, who wants a trio when you can have a quartet? Ticktock. Okay, boys. Ragazzo! Grazioso. Espressivo. Energetico. Grandioso! Finn?  Well, there was supposed to be an intermezzo, but Milo keeps forcing his falsetto and not accepting the fact that he is a castrato. Okay. And Levi thinks this is madrigals, and will not allow me my obbligato. Uhhuh? And then there's Finn. This is not fucking Glee. Now the soul of the piece is obviously in my ostinato, in my praise him. By the time we get to Los Angeles the piece will begin with a sonatina, it will be accompanied by a partita. It will then accelerando into a capriccio. I will play my third role in the equationatto as the contralto of the quarteto. So? Some people prefer a trio. I am one of those people. And for that reason, I'm out.  Say, when is Los Angeles? It's next weekend! Holy fuck. What? Oh, fuck, bud. What? I'm out. Up next, two barn favorites have a plan. Hi, Bonnie. Hi, Daryl. Hi, Bonnie! Hi, Dan. How are you now? Good, and you? Not so bad. Taking a piss? Just a fucking pisser, yeah. Okay. I yacked from donkey juice. Oh, did ya have a spit? You meatsauced. I was up all night, pretty near spitting everywhere. That's pretty near the whole point of donkey juice. Like, you know you're gonna have to spit. Had to call Earl. I called Huey, too. Yeah, I solds the Buick. Oh, did you all toss a sidewalk pizza? Yep. Yep. Yeah. Well, that's pretty near the point of donkey juice. Like, you know you'll have a spit. We are asking for five K for 50% of our business. Fucking serious? Oh, we sees everyone else doing it, figured we'd toss our hats in the ring. You can borrow some money if you want to. No, we've got enough to get by, thanks. Well, we wants to give back to the community by getting jobs for peoples. Well, Uncle Eddie used to always say. An idle mind is the devil's playground. 104, good buddy. Over and out. So Dary and me been making these duck calls and we wants to open up a factory to manufacture these duck calls. Well, see now that is a great, original idea. And, uh, see Dan has a beard and I'll grow a beard, and then the only people that we'd have working in the factory, would also have beards. And that would contribute to our original and unique brand. Unique and original. Yeah. And when we're not making duck calls to contribute to our unique brand, we'd, uh, shoot guns and blows up beaver dams. Oh. Will the beavers be out of the dams before you blow them up? That's unclear. But a dam's got to get blowed up. I'm surprised we're not blowing up beaver dams right now. This is a choice idea, boys. And one that definitely no one has ever attempted before. I think I'm in. What could go wrong? And after we grows our brand and got a followings, we could use our influences to condemn homosexuals. Oh. No, no, 'cause. It's okay because, you know, once we've created our brand, and then condemned the homosexuals, we'll just like go home with our families to eat supper and then hold hands and pray. Well, see now, that's a wee bit of a curve ball, superchieftains. What do you have against homosexuals? Me? Nothing. LQBT is all rights with me. Daryl? Yeah. Nothing. So, why do you want to condemn them? Yeah? We. We seens it on a TV shows. We know. We know. We actually seens it on two TV shows. One was the TV show, what we seens it on, and then the other was a news program about what we seens on the TV shows. We know. But those guys got real popular and they looked like they was having lots of fun so we just figured if we dids what they dids. We could have lots of fun, too. Well, do you still want to blow up beaver dams? Oh, can we still blows up the beaver dams? Oh, yeah, I kind of thought this whole conversation was about us blowing up beaver dams. I'm surprised you're not blowing up beaver dams right now. This idea has lawsuit written all over it. This is the worst pitch we've seen. Ever. And for that reason, I'm out. You want to know what, Dary? You can't even grow a beard. Can too. Cannot. Can too. Cannot. Can too! Cannot! Figure it out!. No, can too! No, you can't. And for that reason, I'm out. But. Well, what are you guys doing now? Me? Nothing. Do ya want to get hammered? Yeah, I'd get hammered. Yeah. I think we're out of beer, though. Beer store's closed.  No! Fuck, do I miss MoDean's. Well, reason fucking five million we need some sort of bar in this town. What did you say when I told you that Uncle Eddie died? I say he's a good guy. The other thing? I say he's a real good guy. The other thing. He'd want us to have a party! Bonnie, thank you for your help today. You're welcome, Wayne. Save me a dance at the next jamboree? Can do. Hey! We all know Uncle Eddie was a real good guy.  Oh, he was a great guy! He was a really good guy! A real good guy. He was a really good guy. Nice guy. Here's to Uncle Eddie. And here's to his five K put back into the community in the most appropriate way possible. Hear, hear! Whoo. This is definitely what he wanted, brother. Did he? Dumdiddydo. We're out of beer. $5,000 worth?. Correct. Beer store's closed.  No!
