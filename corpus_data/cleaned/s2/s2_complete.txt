<STOP> <START> Now that's reasonable. <STOP> <START> And then you get to spend a night with each of them, until you decide which one you want to marry. <STOP> <START> Is that. <STOP> <START> Does she. <STOP> <START> With all three? <STOP> <START> Does she mean. <STOP> <START> After the. <STOP> <START> Well, maybe it means that I would have to. <STOP> <START> I don't want to talk about it, just ask her. <STOP> <START> Okay, I'll ask her. <START> You want to know what? <STOP> <START> I got some fucking questions here. <STOP> <START> Shaboink! <STOP> <START> Now, when you say I spend the night with three of them, is it implied I have sex with all three of them? <STOP> <START> Sure is. <STOP> <START> So, I meet their families. <STOP> <START> Then we go have sex. <STOP> <START> I do that with three of them, before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do the girls know going into the process that I will be having sex with them and two other girls before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Maybe more. <STOP> <START> And do the girls' families, who I've just met, also know, going into the process, that I will be having sex with their daughters, as well as two other girls who are not their daughters, before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And the girls, and their families, find this process entirely rational, despite how selfharming, healthhazardous, and humiliating it very likely will be? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do you say 20 girls, and their families will happily sign up for this process? <STOP> <START> Over and over, I imagine. <STOP> <START> Oh, Gail, I don't want to date a girl like that, for fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> Comes from a family like that. <STOP> <START> Fuck. <STOP> <START> Gail, could there be a female version where there's one girl and 20 dudes?

I mean, there's no way that they could possibly know that. <STOP> <START> I saw Stewart's penis at the Elmira pool on my 11th birthday. <STOP> <START> Looked like a 12ounce cut of pork tenderloin hanging there. <STOP> <START> Erroneous. <STOP> <START> I saw Stewart's penis when we touched tubes, as normal, inquisitive, young boys do, and it looked six pool balls were stuck inside a gym sock, hanging there. <STOP> <START> Unverified. <STOP> <START> Told ya. <STOP> <START> Fuck! <STOP> <START> We are asking for five K for 66.6% of our company. <STOP> <START> Outstanding. <STOP> <START> We want to give back to the community by helping people get sober. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie got sober as a birthday present to himself on his 90th. <STOP> <START> Which was curious, 'cause he'd come that far, right? <STOP> <START> I should say. <STOP> <START> And we plan on doing this by getting the biggest disasters in Letterkenny, and putting them in a room with cameras. <STOP> <START> From there, we film their friends and family telling them they must halt said disastery, posthaste! <STOP> <START> Is disastery a word?

<STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, these winners of the genetic lottery with no more than an ounce of gray matter between them, hope the farmers get behind their plan for young people in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> So, are you just going to do that every time, then, Bonnie?

<START> Yes. <STOP> <START> They'll be wearing only gym shorts, as you can see in the poster. <STOP> <START> And then you'll have all these dudes work out together? <START> Yes, and they'll always be shirtless 'cause there's no AC. <STOP> <START> It's hot. <STOP> <START> Then when all these dudes are done working out together, they can go swimming together?

<STOP> <START> I'm just going to come right out and say it, and you can take that bulletin board with you, please and thanks. <STOP> <START> This idea's a tad fruityloops. <STOP> <START> And for that reason, oh, I'm out. <STOP> <START> What?. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, this bartender turned dogbreeder hopes Cupid will find his way to Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> Say, Bonnie, could I get you anything? <STOP> <START> A glass of water, or. <STOP> <START> I'm okay, Wayne. <STOP> <START> Thanks, though. <STOP> <START> Well, if you change your mind, you can just run to the house there, help yourself. <STOP> <START> Maybe I will run over then. <STOP> <START> Can I get you anything?

<START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Well, get after it. <STOP> <START> Isn't this already a reality series? <STOP> <START> If it is, no one watches it. <STOP> <START> Well, I'd fucking watch it, boy howdy. <STOP> <START> I'll have the girls perform campy tasks and complete silly challenges to prove their mettle. <STOP> <START> Well, that sounds fun. <STOP> <START> Unnecessary, but go on. <STOP> <START> Then you'd go on group dates with them and oneonone dates with them. <STOP> <START> And then you ax them one by one until you decide which one you want to marry. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> I'm not sure it's reasonable that he could choose a wife based just on that. <STOP> <START> I know. <STOP> <START> Tastes good, but where's the cream filling? <STOP> <START> Like a Boston cream? <STOP> <START> Canadian maple's better. <STOP> <START> Well, that's a Texassized 104. <STOP> <START> Here's the kicker. <STOP> <START> When it gets down to the final three girls, deal is, you get to go to their houses and meet their families. <STOP> <START> See? <STOP> <START> Now that's reasonable. <STOP> <START> And then you get to spend a night with each of them, until you decide which one you want to marry. <STOP> <START> Is that. <STOP> <START> Does she. <STOP> <START> With all three? <STOP> <START> Does she mean. <STOP> <START> After the. <STOP> <START> Well, maybe it means that I would have to. <STOP> <START> I don't want to talk about it, just ask her. <STOP> <START> Okay, I'll ask her. <START> You want to know what? <STOP> <START> I got some fucking questions here. <STOP> <START> Shaboink! <STOP> <START> Now, when you say I spend the night with three of them, is it implied I have sex with all three of them? <STOP> <START> Sure is. <STOP> <START> So, I meet their families. <STOP> <START> Then we go have sex. <STOP> <START> I do that with three of them, before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do the girls know going into the process that I will be having sex with them and two other girls before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Maybe more. <STOP> <START> And do the girls' families, who I've just met, also know, going into the process, that I will be having sex with their daughters, as well as two other girls who are not their daughters, before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And the girls, and their families, find this process entirely rational, despite how selfharming, healthhazardous, and humiliating it very likely will be? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do you say 20 girls, and their families will happily sign up for this process? <STOP> <START> Over and over, I imagine. <STOP> <START> Oh, Gail, I don't want to date a girl like that, for fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> Comes from a family like that. <STOP> <START> Fuck. <STOP> <START> Gail, could there be a female version where there's one girl and 20 dudes? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> I'm in. <STOP> <START> No! <STOP> <START> Ew! <START> You're out. <STOP> <START> And do you want to know what? <STOP> <START> What? <STOP> <START> I'm out. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, this husband and wife pair from RR2 Letterkenny wants to go hunting for buried treasure. <STOP> <START> Bonnie! <STOP> <START> Bonnie! <STOP> <START> Did ya feed the dog?

<START> You should feel bad about even suggesting that the Ginger and Boots fucked an ostrich. <STOP> <START> Bad gas travels real fast in a small town. <STOP> <START> My research concludes that the only way the Ginger and Boots could have fucked an ostrich is if it was a dead ostrich. <STOP> <START> Ginger and Boots. a dead ostrich? <STOP> <START> I thought it was just sick! <STOP> <START> Oh, my! <STOP> <START> Ginny? <STOP> <START> The Ginger and Boots effed a dead ostrich. <STOP> <START> Oh, bother. <STOP> <START> Of course I know what the male ones are called! <STOP> <START> Check my browser history. <STOP> <START> Don't show her weakness, Stewart. <STOP> <START> I'm not. <STOP> <START> I'm sun burnt. <STOP> <START> Hey, you! <STOP> <START> Hey, you. <STOP> <START> This is awkward but your shirt seems to have shrunk in the wash. <STOP> <START> Not awkward. <STOP> <START> Things shrink in the wash. <STOP> <START> How do you explain your dick?

<STOP> <START> Samuel. <STOP> <START> I fuckin' hate Samuel. <STOP> <START> Well, Samuel likes you. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' hate Samuel so much. <STOP> <START> Well, Samuel's not so bad. <STOP> <START> I seen Samuel in the laundry room with the cat one time. <START> You just know that little fucker's gonna put him in the dryer. <STOP> <START> That's a hasty conclusion. <STOP> <START> Not if you seen Samuel trying to put himself in there 15 minutes earlier. <STOP> <START> I seen Samuel snort a line of Fun Dip on his fifth birthday. <STOP> <START> Well, it's reason fuckin' five million I didn't go to his sixth birthday party. <STOP> <START> He was doing a Fun Dip dry rip. <STOP> <START> A what? <STOP> <START> Or rippsin' a Fun Dip dry one. <STOP> <START> Well, what's that? <STOP> <START> Well, in schneef terms, if you do a line of schneef before you've ingested any booze to alter your judgment, it's called doing a dry rip. <STOP> <START> Or rippsin' a dry one. <STOP> <START> Doin' dry rips is a pretty good indication you got a schneef problem. <START> You got yourselves a schneef issue. <STOP> <START> Well, yous ever done a dry rip? <STOP> <START> Well, back in the day. <STOP> <START> In the glory days. <START> Yeah, I done a dry rip. <STOP> <START> I'd a rips a dry one. <STOP> <START> Not sure if rippin' a Fun dip dry rip would have the same effect, but doin' it is still a pretty good indication you got some sort of problem. <STOP> <START> Well, hoopin' Fun Dip definitely wouldn't have the same effects, but it's definitely an indication you got yourselves a problem. <STOP> <START> Well, what's hoopin'? <STOP> <START> Well, that's instead of taking the drugs orally's or intranasally's, you take 'em anally's. <STOP> <START> What the fuck you talking about now? <STOP> <START> Well, instead of down the hatch or up the nose, you take 'em in the pooper. <STOP> <START> Wait, you put drugs up your pooper? <STOP> <START> That's the fastest way to absorbs 'em into your systems. <STOP> <START> Do you mean like you take the drugs with your hand. <STOP> <START> Well, then you put 'em up your pooper? <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> But you don't poop 'em out? <STOP> <START> No, your pooper absorbs 'em. <STOP> <START> Well, isn't that curious. <STOP> <START> Hoopin' Fun Dip definitely wouldn't have the same effect as hoopin' schneef. <STOP> <START> But doing it is still probably a pretty good indication you got some sort of a problem. <STOP> <START> I guess a Fun Dip dick dinger wouldn't be the ends of the world. <START> You wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I heard my friends J. <STOP> <START> P. and J. <STOP> <START> W. talk about Fun Dip dick dingers one time. <STOP> <START> Well, whose dick was gettin' dinged? <STOP> <START> Well, I thought it was a bit intrusive to ask whose dick was gettin' dinged. <STOP> <START> As long as they're both consentin' adults, it really doesn't matter whose dick's gettin' dinged. <STOP> <START> Well, I really hope the Fun Dip candy stick isn't going to waste in all this. <STOP> <START> Do you wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I pulled my first allnighter with my friend Chad in grade eight playing Pokemans and eating Fun Dip. <STOP> <START> Oh, waits. <STOP> <START> If. <STOP> <START> If Samuel's already been takin' Fun Dips orally's and intranasally's. <START> Yeah, we should probably go check on Samuel. <STOP> <START> I fuckin' hate Samuel so much. <START> You got any dates lined up this week, good buddy? <STOP> <START> Nah, I'm gonna put that bullshit on the back burner for a bit, bud. <STOP> <START> Soft, literally. <STOP> <START> Parks 'er behind the barn for a bits? <STOP> <START> Tenply. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Gotta find Stormy a stud. <STOP> <START> That's a priority. <STOP> <START> She's a beautiful dog. <STOP> <START> Oh, she's a real beauty. <STOP> <START> No, she's a gorgeous dog. <STOP> <START> She just tries to kill her studs, is the thing. <STOP> <START> Well, that's my girl. <STOP> <START> Maybe you should takes her in for a fingers in the bum. <STOP> <START> Are you fuckin' preoccupied? <STOP> <START> That's only the answer sometimes. <STOP> <START> Squirrelly Dan working' Squirrelly OT. <STOP> <START> Not all the time. <STOP> <START> Just to checks. <STOP> <START> Sometimes. <STOP> <START> Are you fuckin' preoccupied? <STOP> <START> Doesn't matter what you takes her in for. <STOP> <START> As sure as a bush is gonna break your fall, Stormy's gonna get some fingers in the bum. <STOP> <START> How deep? <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> What do ya means, how deep? <STOP> <START> How many knuckles? <STOP> <START> Like how many knuckles deep? <START> Yeah, are we talking about a oneknuckler or a twoknuckler? <STOP> <START> Oh, be at least a threeknuckler to gets to the bottom of this. <STOP> <START> Oh, see, now, that's too many. <STOP> <START> Is not. <STOP> <START> Well, a person's got two knuckles so you're saying that the vet would have to fire a threeknuckler up Stormy's bum to get to the bottom of it? <STOP> <START> A person has three knuckles. <STOP> <START> Well, a person has two knuckles. <STOP> <START> Figure it out. <STOP> <START> A person has three knuckles. <START> You figure it out. <STOP> <START> A person's got two knuckles, okay? <STOP> <START> One, two. <STOP> <START> Three. <START> You forgots about the little knuckles underneath the fingernails. <STOP> <START> Well, see now, that's not a knuckle, though, Dan. <STOP> <START> To be a knuckle, you gotta be able to punch somebody with it. <START> You can't punch somebody with the knuckle underneath the fingernail, can you? <STOP> <START> Can too. <STOP> <START> Well, you'll be looking pretty fuckin' silly. <STOP> <START> First knuckle, one knuckler. <STOP> <START> Second knuckle, twoknuckler. <STOP> <START> Third knuckle, threeknuckler. <STOP> <START> So then by your logic the vet would have to fire a full finger up Stormy's bum to get to the bottom of it. <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> See, I'm just not so goddamn sure I can stand by and watch the vet give Stormy a threeknuckler up the bum. <STOP> <START> No, I don't think Stormy would need a threeknuckler up the bum. <STOP> <START> Well, thank you, Dary, because then you'd think the vet's a bit funny, would you not? <STOP> <START> Mmm, a person has three knuckles, though. <STOP> <START> Thank you, Dary. <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake, go ahead and have a fuckin' fight with your first knuckle then. <START> You'll be lookin' pretty fuckin' silly. <START> Yeah, but when we're talkin' about a twoknuckler, we're talking about horizontal knuckles. <STOP> <START> I'm gonna stop you there. <STOP> <START> By your logic, a sixknuckler can be dealt with using these two fingers? <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> Incorrect. <STOP> <START> No such thing as a sixknuckler. <STOP> <START> A sixknuckler existed, I'd know about it. <STOP> <START> How are ya now, Gail? <STOP> <START> Good, and you?

(HIPHOP MUSIC PLA<START> YING) Faster than shit through a goose. <STOP> <START> Licketysplit. <START> You've entered the barn, where ideas come to blossom or be ridiculed relentlessly. <STOP> <START> On one side, two nononsense farmers are looking to give away their uncle's money. <STOP> <START> On the other, savvy entrepreneurs hoping to acquire it. <STOP> <START> First up, three degens from Letterkenny are hoping to sell the farmers on their solution for a common smalltown problem. <STOP> <START> Hi, Bonnie. <STOP> <START> Hi, Katy. <STOP> <START> Hi, Wayne. <STOP> <START> How are ya now? <STOP> <START> Good and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> Say, thanks for the, uh. <STOP> <START> Well, the thing you did there. <STOP> <START> No problem, Wayne. <STOP> <START> Any time. <STOP> <START> Good afternoon, hicks. <STOP> <START> We are asking for. <STOP> <START> Is it true that you have a massive horn? <START> Yes. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No?  I mean, there's no way that they could possibly know that. <STOP> <START> I saw Stewart's penis at the Elmira pool on my 11th birthday. <STOP> <START> Looked like a 12ounce cut of pork tenderloin hanging there. <STOP> <START> Erroneous. <STOP> <START> I saw Stewart's penis when we touched tubes, as normal, inquisitive, young boys do, and it looked six pool balls were stuck inside a gym sock, hanging there. <STOP> <START> Unverified. <STOP> <START> Told ya. <STOP> <START> Fuck! <STOP> <START> We are asking for five K for 66.6% of our company. <STOP> <START> Outstanding. <STOP> <START> We want to give back to the community by helping people get sober. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie got sober as a birthday present to himself on his 90th. <STOP> <START> Which was curious, 'cause he'd come that far, right? <STOP> <START> I should say. <STOP> <START> And we plan on doing this by getting the biggest disasters in Letterkenny, and putting them in a room with cameras. <STOP> <START> From there, we film their friends and family telling them they must halt said disastery, posthaste! <STOP> <START> Is disastery a word? <STOP> <START> It's a band name. <STOP> <START> Quantifiable. <STOP> <START> Want to know what? <STOP> <START> It feels like I might have seen something like this on a TV show one time. <STOP> <START> We've arranged a demo of how this might work. <STOP> <START> We have? <STOP> <START> Stewart, you are such a disastery that sometimes you don't even know if it's a weekday or the weekend. <STOP> <START> It hurts me to see you being such a disaster. <STOP> <START> I wish you could go back to being only a mild disaster. <STOP> <START> Love, Devon. <STOP> <START> This antic was not discussed or rehearsed. <STOP> <START> Stewart, I worry that your disastery is the result of when we touched tubes as young boys. <STOP> <START> I think about touching tubes with you and sometimes wish I could go back in time and not touch tubes. <STOP> <START> Perhaps had we not touched tubes, you wouldn't be such a disaster. <STOP> <START> Love, Roald. <STOP> <START> Drollery was to be left on the cuttingroom floor. <STOP> <START> Anywho. <START> Your idea comes from a good place, but Uncle Eddie always believed that if a man needs help, he'll ask. <STOP> <START> He won't be told. <STOP> <START> And for that reason, I'm out. <STOP> <START> Sounds like touching tubes was a pretty big setback for Stewart, but your pitch was the real disaster. <STOP> <START> I'm out. <STOP> <START> So, do we win? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, these winners of the genetic lottery with no more than an ounce of gray matter between them, hope the farmers get behind their plan for young people in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> So, are you just going to do that every time, then, Bonnie? <STOP> <START> Well, if you want me to, Wayne. <START> Yes, please. <START> You got it, Wayne. <STOP> <START> Thank you. <STOP> <START> Good afternoon, Wayne, and shewedonotspeakof. <STOP> <START> Oh, piss off. <START> You both took down your team's student trainer on her kinesiology coop. <STOP> <START> How'd she find out about. <STOP> <START> Shh! <STOP> <START> There's hope for you yet, boys. <STOP> <START> We are here asking for five K for 49% of our company. <STOP> <START> Super. <STOP> <START> We want to give back to the community by investing in the youth, boys. <STOP> <START> Really hustle for the youth, boys. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie loved kids. <STOP> <START> His only shortcoming, really. <STOP> <START> We want to take the toughest youth in Letterkenny and put them into a house together, with a gym and with a pool. <STOP> <START> There, they'll work out together while receiving instructions from coaches, Joint Boy and Tyson. <STOP> <START> They will then fight each other one by one to find out who is, in fact, the toughest kid in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> This concept sounds a bit familiar. <STOP> <START> No, it's a fresh concept, ferda. <STOP> <START> Ferda fresh. <STOP> <START> Well, I'm trying to wrap my head around this, so I've got a few questions, here. <STOP> <START> So, you want to put a bunch of dudes in a house together? <START> Yes. <STOP> <START> They'll be wearing only gym shorts, as you can see in the poster. <STOP> <START> And then you'll have all these dudes work out together? <START> Yes, and they'll always be shirtless 'cause there's no AC. <STOP> <START> It's hot. <STOP> <START> Then when all these dudes are done working out together, they can go swimming together? <STOP> <START> Oh, we'll teach them how to wrestle, too. <STOP> <START> Hold downs, full mount, top control. <STOP> <START> Throw some booze in the house. <STOP> <START> They can have a drink together. <STOP> <START> What are you really trying to accomplish here, boys?. <STOP> <START> Great presentation. <STOP> <START> I really love the bulletin board with all the sweaty dudes. <START> You can just leave that here. <STOP> <START> But I don't think that Uncle Eddie would say, Katy, great investment in sweaty dudes. <STOP> <START> And for that reason, I'm out. <START> You want to know what?

<STOP> <START> Like a Boston cream? <STOP> <START> Canadian maple's better. <STOP> <START> Well, that's a Texassized 104. <STOP> <START> Here's the kicker. <STOP> <START> When it gets down to the final three girls, deal is, you get to go to their houses and meet their families. <STOP> <START> See? <STOP> <START> Now that's reasonable. <STOP> <START> And then you get to spend a night with each of them, until you decide which one you want to marry. <STOP> <START> Is that. <STOP> <START> Does she. <STOP> <START> With all three? <STOP> <START> Does she mean. <STOP> <START> After the. <STOP> <START> Well, maybe it means that I would have to. <STOP> <START> I don't want to talk about it, just ask her. <STOP> <START> Okay, I'll ask her. <START> You want to know what? <STOP> <START> I got some fucking questions here. <STOP> <START> Shaboink! <STOP> <START> Now, when you say I spend the night with three of them, is it implied I have sex with all three of them? <STOP> <START> Sure is. <STOP> <START> So, I meet their families. <STOP> <START> Then we go have sex. <STOP> <START> I do that with three of them, before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do the girls know going into the process that I will be having sex with them and two other girls before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Maybe more. <STOP> <START> And do the girls' families, who I've just met, also know, going into the process, that I will be having sex with their daughters, as well as two other girls who are not their daughters, before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And the girls, and their families, find this process entirely rational, despite how selfharming, healthhazardous, and humiliating it very likely will be? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do you say 20 girls, and their families will happily sign up for this process? <STOP> <START> Over and over, I imagine. <STOP> <START> Oh, Gail, I don't want to date a girl like that, for fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> Comes from a family like that. <STOP> <START> Fuck. <STOP> <START> Gail, could there be a female version where there's one girl and 20 dudes? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> I'm in. <STOP> <START> No! <STOP> <START> Ew! <START> You're out. <STOP> <START> And do you want to know what? <STOP> <START> What? <STOP> <START> I'm out. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, this husband and wife pair from RR2 Letterkenny wants to go hunting for buried treasure. <STOP> <START> Bonnie! <STOP> <START> Bonnie! <STOP> <START> Did ya feed the dog?

<STOP> <START> I got some fucking questions here. <STOP> <START> Shaboink! <STOP> <START> Now, when you say I spend the night with three of them, is it implied I have sex with all three of them? <STOP> <START> Sure is. <STOP> <START> So, I meet their families. <STOP> <START> Then we go have sex. <STOP> <START> I do that with three of them, before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do the girls know going into the process that I will be having sex with them and two other girls before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Maybe more. <STOP> <START> And do the girls' families, who I've just met, also know, going into the process, that I will be having sex with their daughters, as well as two other girls who are not their daughters, before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And the girls, and their families, find this process entirely rational, despite how selfharming, healthhazardous, and humiliating it very likely will be? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do you say 20 girls, and their families will happily sign up for this process? <STOP> <START> Over and over, I imagine. <STOP> <START> Oh, Gail, I don't want to date a girl like that, for fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> Comes from a family like that. <STOP> <START> Fuck. <STOP> <START> Gail, could there be a female version where there's one girl and 20 dudes?

<START> You should feel bad about even suggesting that the Ginger and Boots fucked an ostrich. <STOP> <START> Bad gas travels real fast in a small town. <STOP> <START> My research concludes that the only way the Ginger and Boots could have fucked an ostrich is if it was a dead ostrich. <STOP> <START> Ginger and Boots. a dead ostrich?

Hmm. <STOP> <START> That's a hard no. <STOP> <START> He'd be inheriting a lot of problems. <STOP> <START> Letterkenny problems. <STOP> <START> He's a farmer. <STOP> <START> But has anyone ever seen him do any actual work?

<STOP> <START> Figure it out. <STOP> <START> Dan? <STOP> <START> Daryl? <STOP> <START> Please help. <STOP> <START> Reilly! <STOP> <START> Jonesy! <STOP> <START> Let's see what you can do. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Warm up?

<STOP> <START> Go! <STOP> <START> Kevin Costner. <STOP> <START> Keanu Reeves. <STOP> <START> John Candy. <STOP> <START> Chloe Sevigny. <STOP> <START> It's easy. <STOP> <START> Taylor Kitsch, boys. <STOP> <START> Big Riggins himself. <START> You picked Big Riggins, so I'll take Michael Fassbender, bro. <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> But if. <STOP> <START> If Big Riggins, if he's not available, 'cause he's my number one, it's easy, Chad Michael Murray, boys. <STOP> <START> Big Riggins is still my number one but I love Chaz Michael, bro. <STOP> <START> One Tree Hill! <STOP> <START> Boom! <STOP> <START> Go with Michael Fassbender. <STOP> <START> Try channeling that. <STOP> <START> Choose Big Riggins. <START> You know what? <STOP> <START> Actors named Michael could really reinvent themselves if they change their names to Spike, like uh, Spike Fassbenders or, uh, Spike Caine or Spike J. <STOP> <START> Fox. <STOP> <START> Spike Buble. <STOP> <START> Chaz Spike Murray? <STOP> <START> Oh, C. <STOP> <START> Spike Murray? <STOP> <START> Let's try and stay on task! <STOP> <START> Well, now it might be kind of awkward, might be kind of awkward if actors named Richards started going by Dick. <STOP> <START> Right? <STOP> <START> Like Dick Gere. <STOP> <START> Dick Pryor. <STOP> <START> Dick Dreyfuss. <STOP> <START> Lionel Dick. <STOP> <START> Feel like Richard Simmons probably prefers Dick. <STOP> <START> Dude, he got fucking mad. <STOP> <START> Well, looks like she's back to cutting lawns. <STOP> <START> All those for Wayne resuming presidency of the Ag Hall. <STOP> <START> Can I get a one vote here?

<STOP> <START> How? <STOP> <START> I said I would beat Devon's view count, not win you the election. <STOP> <START> And guess what? <STOP> <START> I did beat Devon's view count. <STOP> <START> Look. <STOP> <START> Oh, I don't give a care. <STOP> <START> I've been contacted by Budweiser and Carl's Jr. over copyright infringements, but I don't think they're serious. <START> You wanna know what? <STOP> <START> McMurray's meetings are a bit painful, but not sure that's good enough reason to get into politics. <STOP> <START> They're all crooks. <STOP> <START> Every one of them. <STOP> <START> Now run along, Stewart, before I get bored of behaving. <STOP> <START> Well, I guess she's off to chore. <STOP> <START> Been busy cutting other people's fucking lawns all week. <STOP> <START> Jim Dickins. <STOP> <START> How're ya now? <STOP> <START> It's Dicks. <STOP> <START> Nope, you got it right that time. <STOP> <START> Good n' you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> I said I'd return the favor for cutting the lawn. <STOP> <START> I figured there's no time like the present. <STOP> <START> Can we give you a hand with anything?<START> You're having thirsty Thursday with your pals the other day. <STOP> <START> It was my cousin's sixth birthday party yesterday. <STOP> <START> Which cousin? <STOP> <START> Samuel. <STOP> <START> I fuckin' hate Samuel. <STOP> <START> Well, Samuel likes you. <STOP> <START> Fuckin' hate Samuel so much. <STOP> <START> Well, Samuel's not so bad. <STOP> <START> I seen Samuel in the laundry room with the cat one time. <START> You just know that little fucker's gonna put him in the dryer. <STOP> <START> That's a hasty conclusion. <STOP> <START> Not if you seen Samuel trying to put himself in there 15 minutes earlier. <STOP> <START> I seen Samuel snort a line of Fun Dip on his fifth birthday. <STOP> <START> Well, it's reason fuckin' five million I didn't go to his sixth birthday party. <STOP> <START> He was doing a Fun Dip dry rip. <STOP> <START> A what? <STOP> <START> Or rippsin' a Fun Dip dry one. <STOP> <START> Well, what's that? <STOP> <START> Well, in schneef terms, if you do a line of schneef before you've ingested any booze to alter your judgment, it's called doing a dry rip. <STOP> <START> Or rippsin' a dry one. <STOP> <START> Doin' dry rips is a pretty good indication you got a schneef problem. <START> You got yourselves a schneef issue. <STOP> <START> Well, yous ever done a dry rip? <STOP> <START> Well, back in the day. <STOP> <START> In the glory days. <START> Yeah, I done a dry rip. <STOP> <START> I'd a rips a dry one. <STOP> <START> Not sure if rippin' a Fun dip dry rip would have the same effect, but doin' it is still a pretty good indication you got some sort of problem. <STOP> <START> Well, hoopin' Fun Dip definitely wouldn't have the same effects, but it's definitely an indication you got yourselves a problem. <STOP> <START> Well, what's hoopin'? <STOP> <START> Well, that's instead of taking the drugs orally's or intranasally's, you take 'em anally's. <STOP> <START> What the fuck you talking about now? <STOP> <START> Well, instead of down the hatch or up the nose, you take 'em in the pooper. <STOP> <START> Wait, you put drugs up your pooper? <STOP> <START> That's the fastest way to absorbs 'em into your systems. <STOP> <START> Do you mean like you take the drugs with your hand. <STOP> <START> Well, then you put 'em up your pooper? <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> But you don't poop 'em out? <STOP> <START> No, your pooper absorbs 'em. <STOP> <START> Well, isn't that curious. <STOP> <START> Hoopin' Fun Dip definitely wouldn't have the same effect as hoopin' schneef. <STOP> <START> But doing it is still probably a pretty good indication you got some sort of a problem. <STOP> <START> I guess a Fun Dip dick dinger wouldn't be the ends of the world. <START> You wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I heard my friends J. <STOP> <START> P. and J. <STOP> <START> W. talk about Fun Dip dick dingers one time. <STOP> <START> Well, whose dick was gettin' dinged? <STOP> <START> Well, I thought it was a bit intrusive to ask whose dick was gettin' dinged. <STOP> <START> As long as they're both consentin' adults, it really doesn't matter whose dick's gettin' dinged. <STOP> <START> Well, I really hope the Fun Dip candy stick isn't going to waste in all this. <STOP> <START> Do you wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I pulled my first allnighter with my friend Chad in grade eight playing Pokemans and eating Fun Dip. <STOP> <START> Oh, waits. <STOP> <START> If. <STOP> <START> If Samuel's already been takin' Fun Dips orally's and intranasally's. <START> Yeah, we should probably go check on Samuel. <STOP> <START> I fuckin' hate Samuel so much. <START> You got any dates lined up this week, good buddy? <STOP> <START> Nah, I'm gonna put that bullshit on the back burner for a bit, bud. <STOP> <START> Soft, literally. <STOP> <START> Parks 'er behind the barn for a bits? <STOP> <START> Tenply. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Gotta find Stormy a stud. <STOP> <START> That's a priority. <STOP> <START> She's a beautiful dog. <STOP> <START> Oh, she's a real beauty. <STOP> <START> No, she's a gorgeous dog. <STOP> <START> She just tries to kill her studs, is the thing. <STOP> <START> Well, that's my girl. <STOP> <START> Maybe you should takes her in for a fingers in the bum. <STOP> <START> Are you fuckin' preoccupied? <STOP> <START> That's only the answer sometimes. <STOP> <START> Squirrelly Dan working' Squirrelly OT. <STOP> <START> Not all the time. <STOP> <START> Just to checks. <STOP> <START> Sometimes. <STOP> <START> Are you fuckin' preoccupied? <STOP> <START> Doesn't matter what you takes her in for. <STOP> <START> As sure as a bush is gonna break your fall, Stormy's gonna get some fingers in the bum. <STOP> <START> How deep? <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> What do ya means, how deep? <STOP> <START> How many knuckles? <STOP> <START> Like how many knuckles deep? <START> Yeah, are we talking about a oneknuckler or a twoknuckler? <STOP> <START> Oh, be at least a threeknuckler to gets to the bottom of this. <STOP> <START> Oh, see, now, that's too many. <STOP> <START> Is not. <STOP> <START> Well, a person's got two knuckles so you're saying that the vet would have to fire a threeknuckler up Stormy's bum to get to the bottom of it? <STOP> <START> A person has three knuckles. <STOP> <START> Well, a person has two knuckles. <STOP> <START> Figure it out. <STOP> <START> A person has three knuckles. <START> You figure it out. <STOP> <START> A person's got two knuckles, okay? <STOP> <START> One, two. <STOP> <START> Three. <START> You forgots about the little knuckles underneath the fingernails. <STOP> <START> Well, see now, that's not a knuckle, though, Dan. <STOP> <START> To be a knuckle, you gotta be able to punch somebody with it. <START> You can't punch somebody with the knuckle underneath the fingernail, can you? <STOP> <START> Can too. <STOP> <START> Well, you'll be looking pretty fuckin' silly. <STOP> <START> First knuckle, one knuckler. <STOP> <START> Second knuckle, twoknuckler. <STOP> <START> Third knuckle, threeknuckler. <STOP> <START> So then by your logic the vet would have to fire a full finger up Stormy's bum to get to the bottom of it. <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> See, I'm just not so goddamn sure I can stand by and watch the vet give Stormy a threeknuckler up the bum. <STOP> <START> No, I don't think Stormy would need a threeknuckler up the bum. <STOP> <START> Well, thank you, Dary, because then you'd think the vet's a bit funny, would you not? <STOP> <START> Mmm, a person has three knuckles, though. <STOP> <START> Thank you, Dary. <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake, go ahead and have a fuckin' fight with your first knuckle then. <START> You'll be lookin' pretty fuckin' silly. <START> Yeah, but when we're talkin' about a twoknuckler, we're talking about horizontal knuckles. <STOP> <START> I'm gonna stop you there. <STOP> <START> By your logic, a sixknuckler can be dealt with using these two fingers? <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> Incorrect. <STOP> <START> No such thing as a sixknuckler. <STOP> <START> A sixknuckler existed, I'd know about it. <STOP> <START> How are ya now, Gail? <STOP> <START> Good, and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> Got a stud for Stormy. <STOP> <START> Comes from the Baumgartner breeders. <STOP> <START> Name's Ken. <STOP> <START> Ken Baumgartner? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Okay. <START> You're not exposed to give dogs human names. <STOP> <START> Can do what I want. <STOP> <START> Well, sure you can, I'm just sayin' you're not exposed to. <STOP> <START> Baumgartner's been breeding German Shepherds out in Chemmy for six years. <STOP> <START> Champion bloodlines. <STOP> <START> Elegance. <STOP> <START> Strength. <STOP> <START> Raw food diet. <START> You got him in the truck? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Well, pull around back. <STOP> <START> See if they'll have a go. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Hey, Dan. <STOP> <START> Do you wanna know how I know about a sixknuckler?

I mean, there's no way that they could possibly know that. <STOP> <START> I saw Stewart's penis at the Elmira pool on my 11th birthday. <STOP> <START> Looked like a 12ounce cut of pork tenderloin hanging there. <STOP> <START> Erroneous. <STOP> <START> I saw Stewart's penis when we touched tubes, as normal, inquisitive, young boys do, and it looked six pool balls were stuck inside a gym sock, hanging there. <STOP> <START> Unverified. <STOP> <START> Told ya. <STOP> <START> Fuck! <STOP> <START> We are asking for five K for 66.6% of our company. <STOP> <START> Outstanding. <STOP> <START> We want to give back to the community by helping people get sober. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie got sober as a birthday present to himself on his 90th. <STOP> <START> Which was curious, 'cause he'd come that far, right? <STOP> <START> I should say. <STOP> <START> And we plan on doing this by getting the biggest disasters in Letterkenny, and putting them in a room with cameras. <STOP> <START> From there, we film their friends and family telling them they must halt said disastery, posthaste! <STOP> <START> Is disastery a word?

<STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, these winners of the genetic lottery with no more than an ounce of gray matter between them, hope the farmers get behind their plan for young people in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> So, are you just going to do that every time, then, Bonnie?

<START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Well, get after it. <STOP> <START> Isn't this already a reality series? <STOP> <START> If it is, no one watches it. <STOP> <START> Well, I'd fucking watch it, boy howdy. <STOP> <START> I'll have the girls perform campy tasks and complete silly challenges to prove their mettle. <STOP> <START> Well, that sounds fun. <STOP> <START> Unnecessary, but go on. <STOP> <START> Then you'd go on group dates with them and oneonone dates with them. <STOP> <START> And then you ax them one by one until you decide which one you want to marry. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> I'm not sure it's reasonable that he could choose a wife based just on that. <STOP> <START> I know. <STOP> <START> Tastes good, but where's the cream filling? <STOP> <START> Like a Boston cream? <STOP> <START> Canadian maple's better. <STOP> <START> Well, that's a Texassized 104. <STOP> <START> Here's the kicker. <STOP> <START> When it gets down to the final three girls, deal is, you get to go to their houses and meet their families. <STOP> <START> See? <STOP> <START> Now that's reasonable. <STOP> <START> And then you get to spend a night with each of them, until you decide which one you want to marry. <STOP> <START> Is that. <STOP> <START> Does she. <STOP> <START> With all three? <STOP> <START> Does she mean. <STOP> <START> After the. <STOP> <START> Well, maybe it means that I would have to. <STOP> <START> I don't want to talk about it, just ask her. <STOP> <START> Okay, I'll ask her. <START> You want to know what? <STOP> <START> I got some fucking questions here. <STOP> <START> Shaboink! <STOP> <START> Now, when you say I spend the night with three of them, is it implied I have sex with all three of them? <STOP> <START> Sure is. <STOP> <START> So, I meet their families. <STOP> <START> Then we go have sex. <STOP> <START> I do that with three of them, before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do the girls know going into the process that I will be having sex with them and two other girls before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Maybe more. <STOP> <START> And do the girls' families, who I've just met, also know, going into the process, that I will be having sex with their daughters, as well as two other girls who are not their daughters, before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And the girls, and their families, find this process entirely rational, despite how selfharming, healthhazardous, and humiliating it very likely will be? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do you say 20 girls, and their families will happily sign up for this process? <STOP> <START> Over and over, I imagine. <STOP> <START> Oh, Gail, I don't want to date a girl like that, for fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> Comes from a family like that. <STOP> <START> Fuck. <STOP> <START> Gail, could there be a female version where there's one girl and 20 dudes? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> I'm in. <STOP> <START> No! <STOP> <START> Ew! <START> You're out. <STOP> <START> And do you want to know what? <STOP> <START> What? <STOP> <START> I'm out. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, this husband and wife pair from RR2 Letterkenny wants to go hunting for buried treasure. <STOP> <START> Bonnie! <STOP> <START> Bonnie! <STOP> <START> Did ya feed the dog?

<START> You should feel bad about even suggesting that the Ginger and Boots fucked an ostrich. <STOP> <START> Bad gas travels real fast in a small town. <STOP> <START> My research concludes that the only way the Ginger and Boots could have fucked an ostrich is if it was a dead ostrich. <STOP> <START> Ginger and Boots. a dead ostrich? <STOP> <START> I thought it was just sick! <STOP> <START> Oh, my! <STOP> <START> Ginny? <STOP> <START> The Ginger and Boots effed a dead ostrich. <STOP> <START> Oh, bother. <STOP> <START> Of course I know what the male ones are called! <STOP> <START> Check my browser history. <STOP> <START> Don't show her weakness, Stewart. <STOP> <START> I'm not. <STOP> <START> I'm sun burnt. <STOP> <START> Hey, you! <STOP> <START> Hey, you. <STOP> <START> This is awkward but your shirt seems to have shrunk in the wash. <STOP> <START> Not awkward. <STOP> <START> Things shrink in the wash. <STOP> <START> How do you explain your dick?

<STOP> <START> Well, that's instead of taking the drugs orally's or intranasally's, you take 'em anally's. <STOP> <START> What the fuck you talking about now? <STOP> <START> Well, instead of down the hatch or up the nose, you take 'em in the pooper. <STOP> <START> Wait, you put drugs up your pooper? <STOP> <START> That's the fastest way to absorbs 'em into your systems. <STOP> <START> Do you mean like you take the drugs with your hand. <STOP> <START> Well, then you put 'em up your pooper? <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> But you don't poop 'em out? <STOP> <START> No, your pooper absorbs 'em. <STOP> <START> Well, isn't that curious. <STOP> <START> Hoopin' Fun Dip definitely wouldn't have the same effect as hoopin' schneef. <STOP> <START> But doing it is still probably a pretty good indication you got some sort of a problem. <STOP> <START> I guess a Fun Dip dick dinger wouldn't be the ends of the world. <START> You wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I heard my friends J. <STOP> <START> P. and J. <STOP> <START> W. talk about Fun Dip dick dingers one time. <STOP> <START> Well, whose dick was gettin' dinged? <STOP> <START> Well, I thought it was a bit intrusive to ask whose dick was gettin' dinged. <STOP> <START> As long as they're both consentin' adults, it really doesn't matter whose dick's gettin' dinged. <STOP> <START> Well, I really hope the Fun Dip candy stick isn't going to waste in all this. <STOP> <START> Do you wanna know what? <STOP> <START> I pulled my first allnighter with my friend Chad in grade eight playing Pokemans and eating Fun Dip. <STOP> <START> Oh, waits. <STOP> <START> If. <STOP> <START> If Samuel's already been takin' Fun Dips orally's and intranasally's. <START> Yeah, we should probably go check on Samuel. <STOP> <START> I fuckin' hate Samuel so much. <START> You got any dates lined up this week, good buddy?

<STOP> <START> That's only the answer sometimes. <STOP> <START> Squirrelly Dan working' Squirrelly OT. <STOP> <START> Not all the time. <STOP> <START> Just to checks. <STOP> <START> Sometimes. <STOP> <START> Are you fuckin' preoccupied? <STOP> <START> Doesn't matter what you takes her in for. <STOP> <START> As sure as a bush is gonna break your fall, Stormy's gonna get some fingers in the bum. <STOP> <START> How deep? <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> What do ya means, how deep? <STOP> <START> How many knuckles? <STOP> <START> Like how many knuckles deep? <START> Yeah, are we talking about a oneknuckler or a twoknuckler? <STOP> <START> Oh, be at least a threeknuckler to gets to the bottom of this. <STOP> <START> Oh, see, now, that's too many. <STOP> <START> Is not. <STOP> <START> Well, a person's got two knuckles so you're saying that the vet would have to fire a threeknuckler up Stormy's bum to get to the bottom of it? <STOP> <START> A person has three knuckles. <STOP> <START> Well, a person has two knuckles. <STOP> <START> Figure it out. <STOP> <START> A person has three knuckles. <START> You figure it out. <STOP> <START> A person's got two knuckles, okay? <STOP> <START> One, two. <STOP> <START> Three. <START> You forgots about the little knuckles underneath the fingernails. <STOP> <START> Well, see now, that's not a knuckle, though, Dan. <STOP> <START> To be a knuckle, you gotta be able to punch somebody with it. <START> You can't punch somebody with the knuckle underneath the fingernail, can you? <STOP> <START> Can too. <STOP> <START> Well, you'll be looking pretty fuckin' silly. <STOP> <START> First knuckle, one knuckler. <STOP> <START> Second knuckle, twoknuckler. <STOP> <START> Third knuckle, threeknuckler. <STOP> <START> So then by your logic the vet would have to fire a full finger up Stormy's bum to get to the bottom of it. <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> See, I'm just not so goddamn sure I can stand by and watch the vet give Stormy a threeknuckler up the bum. <STOP> <START> No, I don't think Stormy would need a threeknuckler up the bum. <STOP> <START> Well, thank you, Dary, because then you'd think the vet's a bit funny, would you not? <STOP> <START> Mmm, a person has three knuckles, though. <STOP> <START> Thank you, Dary. <STOP> <START> Fuck's sake, go ahead and have a fuckin' fight with your first knuckle then. <START> You'll be lookin' pretty fuckin' silly. <START> Yeah, but when we're talkin' about a twoknuckler, we're talking about horizontal knuckles. <STOP> <START> I'm gonna stop you there. <STOP> <START> By your logic, a sixknuckler can be dealt with using these two fingers? <STOP> <START> Correct. <STOP> <START> Incorrect. <STOP> <START> No such thing as a sixknuckler. <STOP> <START> A sixknuckler existed, I'd know about it. <STOP> <START> How are ya now, Gail? <STOP> <START> Good, and you?

(HIPHOP MUSIC PLA<START> YING) Faster than shit through a goose. <STOP> <START> Licketysplit. <START> You've entered the barn, where ideas come to blossom or be ridiculed relentlessly. <STOP> <START> On one side, two nononsense farmers are looking to give away their uncle's money. <STOP> <START> On the other, savvy entrepreneurs hoping to acquire it. <STOP> <START> First up, three degens from Letterkenny are hoping to sell the farmers on their solution for a common smalltown problem. <STOP> <START> Hi, Bonnie. <STOP> <START> Hi, Katy. <STOP> <START> Hi, Wayne. <STOP> <START> How are ya now? <STOP> <START> Good and you? <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> Say, thanks for the, uh. <STOP> <START> Well, the thing you did there. <STOP> <START> No problem, Wayne. <STOP> <START> Any time. <STOP> <START> Good afternoon, hicks. <STOP> <START> We are asking for. <STOP> <START> Is it true that you have a massive horn? <START> Yes. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No?  I mean, there's no way that they could possibly know that. <STOP> <START> I saw Stewart's penis at the Elmira pool on my 11th birthday. <STOP> <START> Looked like a 12ounce cut of pork tenderloin hanging there. <STOP> <START> Erroneous. <STOP> <START> I saw Stewart's penis when we touched tubes, as normal, inquisitive, young boys do, and it looked six pool balls were stuck inside a gym sock, hanging there. <STOP> <START> Unverified. <STOP> <START> Told ya. <STOP> <START> Fuck! <STOP> <START> We are asking for five K for 66.6% of our company. <STOP> <START> Outstanding. <STOP> <START> We want to give back to the community by helping people get sober. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie got sober as a birthday present to himself on his 90th. <STOP> <START> Which was curious, 'cause he'd come that far, right? <STOP> <START> I should say. <STOP> <START> And we plan on doing this by getting the biggest disasters in Letterkenny, and putting them in a room with cameras. <STOP> <START> From there, we film their friends and family telling them they must halt said disastery, posthaste! <STOP> <START> Is disastery a word? <STOP> <START> It's a band name. <STOP> <START> Quantifiable. <STOP> <START> Want to know what? <STOP> <START> It feels like I might have seen something like this on a TV show one time. <STOP> <START> We've arranged a demo of how this might work. <STOP> <START> We have? <STOP> <START> Stewart, you are such a disastery that sometimes you don't even know if it's a weekday or the weekend. <STOP> <START> It hurts me to see you being such a disaster. <STOP> <START> I wish you could go back to being only a mild disaster. <STOP> <START> Love, Devon. <STOP> <START> This antic was not discussed or rehearsed. <STOP> <START> Stewart, I worry that your disastery is the result of when we touched tubes as young boys. <STOP> <START> I think about touching tubes with you and sometimes wish I could go back in time and not touch tubes. <STOP> <START> Perhaps had we not touched tubes, you wouldn't be such a disaster. <STOP> <START> Love, Roald. <STOP> <START> Drollery was to be left on the cuttingroom floor. <STOP> <START> Anywho. <START> Your idea comes from a good place, but Uncle Eddie always believed that if a man needs help, he'll ask. <STOP> <START> He won't be told. <STOP> <START> And for that reason, I'm out. <STOP> <START> Sounds like touching tubes was a pretty big setback for Stewart, but your pitch was the real disaster. <STOP> <START> I'm out. <STOP> <START> So, do we win? <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> No. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, these winners of the genetic lottery with no more than an ounce of gray matter between them, hope the farmers get behind their plan for young people in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> So, are you just going to do that every time, then, Bonnie? <STOP> <START> Well, if you want me to, Wayne. <START> Yes, please. <START> You got it, Wayne. <STOP> <START> Thank you. <STOP> <START> Good afternoon, Wayne, and shewedonotspeakof. <STOP> <START> Oh, piss off. <START> You both took down your team's student trainer on her kinesiology coop. <STOP> <START> How'd she find out about. <STOP> <START> Shh! <STOP> <START> There's hope for you yet, boys. <STOP> <START> We are here asking for five K for 49% of our company. <STOP> <START> Super. <STOP> <START> We want to give back to the community by investing in the youth, boys. <STOP> <START> Really hustle for the youth, boys. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie loved kids. <STOP> <START> His only shortcoming, really. <STOP> <START> We want to take the toughest youth in Letterkenny and put them into a house together, with a gym and with a pool. <STOP> <START> There, they'll work out together while receiving instructions from coaches, Joint Boy and Tyson. <STOP> <START> They will then fight each other one by one to find out who is, in fact, the toughest kid in Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> This concept sounds a bit familiar. <STOP> <START> No, it's a fresh concept, ferda. <STOP> <START> Ferda fresh. <STOP> <START> Well, I'm trying to wrap my head around this, so I've got a few questions, here. <STOP> <START> So, you want to put a bunch of dudes in a house together? <START> Yes. <STOP> <START> They'll be wearing only gym shorts, as you can see in the poster. <STOP> <START> And then you'll have all these dudes work out together? <START> Yes, and they'll always be shirtless 'cause there's no AC. <STOP> <START> It's hot. <STOP> <START> Then when all these dudes are done working out together, they can go swimming together? <STOP> <START> Oh, we'll teach them how to wrestle, too. <STOP> <START> Hold downs, full mount, top control. <STOP> <START> Throw some booze in the house. <STOP> <START> They can have a drink together. <STOP> <START> What are you really trying to accomplish here, boys?. <STOP> <START> Great presentation. <STOP> <START> I really love the bulletin board with all the sweaty dudes. <START> You can just leave that here. <STOP> <START> But I don't think that Uncle Eddie would say, Katy, great investment in sweaty dudes. <STOP> <START> And for that reason, I'm out. <START> You want to know what? <STOP> <START> I'm just going to come right out and say it, and you can take that bulletin board with you, please and thanks. <STOP> <START> This idea's a tad fruityloops. <STOP> <START> And for that reason, oh, I'm out. <STOP> <START> What?. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, this bartender turned dogbreeder hopes Cupid will find his way to Letterkenny. <STOP> <START> Say, Bonnie, could I get you anything? <STOP> <START> A glass of water, or. <STOP> <START> I'm okay, Wayne. <STOP> <START> Thanks, though. <STOP> <START> Well, if you change your mind, you can just run to the house there, help yourself. <STOP> <START> Maybe I will run over then. <STOP> <START> Can I get you anything? <STOP> <START> Well, no, I'm okay. <STOP> <START> Do you want anything from the. <STOP> <START> Hmm. <STOP> <START> Wet your whistle. <STOP> <START> No, I'm good. <STOP> <START> I got some water. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> No, we're okay. <STOP> <START> Thank you, Bonnie. <STOP> <START> Cool, Wayne. <STOP> <START> Good afternoon, Wayne, Katy. <STOP> <START> Gail, how are you now? <STOP> <START> Good, and you? <STOP> <START> Well, not so bad. <STOP> <START> I'm asking for five K for 69% of my company. <STOP> <START> Why 69? <STOP> <START> Both sides benefit. <STOP> <START> Good enough. <STOP> <START> I want to give back to the community by helping people find love. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie was a notorious matchmaker. <STOP> <START> And a real fucking legend on the D floor right up till the bitter end. <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And I plan on doing that by putting 20 women from Letterkenny into a house with you, and having 'em all compete for your hand in marriage. <STOP> <START> Who, me? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Well, get after it. <STOP> <START> Isn't this already a reality series? <STOP> <START> If it is, no one watches it. <STOP> <START> Well, I'd fucking watch it, boy howdy. <STOP> <START> I'll have the girls perform campy tasks and complete silly challenges to prove their mettle. <STOP> <START> Well, that sounds fun. <STOP> <START> Unnecessary, but go on. <STOP> <START> Then you'd go on group dates with them and oneonone dates with them. <STOP> <START> And then you ax them one by one until you decide which one you want to marry. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> I'm not sure it's reasonable that he could choose a wife based just on that. <STOP> <START> I know. <STOP> <START> Tastes good, but where's the cream filling? <STOP> <START> Like a Boston cream? <STOP> <START> Canadian maple's better. <STOP> <START> Well, that's a Texassized 104. <STOP> <START> Here's the kicker. <STOP> <START> When it gets down to the final three girls, deal is, you get to go to their houses and meet their families. <STOP> <START> See? <STOP> <START> Now that's reasonable. <STOP> <START> And then you get to spend a night with each of them, until you decide which one you want to marry. <STOP> <START> Is that. <STOP> <START> Does she. <STOP> <START> With all three? <STOP> <START> Does she mean. <STOP> <START> After the. <STOP> <START> Well, maybe it means that I would have to. <STOP> <START> I don't want to talk about it, just ask her. <STOP> <START> Okay, I'll ask her. <START> You want to know what? <STOP> <START> I got some fucking questions here. <STOP> <START> Shaboink! <STOP> <START> Now, when you say I spend the night with three of them, is it implied I have sex with all three of them? <STOP> <START> Sure is. <STOP> <START> So, I meet their families. <STOP> <START> Then we go have sex. <STOP> <START> I do that with three of them, before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do the girls know going into the process that I will be having sex with them and two other girls before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Maybe more. <STOP> <START> And do the girls' families, who I've just met, also know, going into the process, that I will be having sex with their daughters, as well as two other girls who are not their daughters, before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And the girls, and their families, find this process entirely rational, despite how selfharming, healthhazardous, and humiliating it very likely will be? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do you say 20 girls, and their families will happily sign up for this process? <STOP> <START> Over and over, I imagine. <STOP> <START> Oh, Gail, I don't want to date a girl like that, for fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> Comes from a family like that. <STOP> <START> Fuck. <STOP> <START> Gail, could there be a female version where there's one girl and 20 dudes? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> I'm in. <STOP> <START> No! <STOP> <START> Ew! <START> You're out. <STOP> <START> And do you want to know what? <STOP> <START> What? <STOP> <START> I'm out. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, this husband and wife pair from RR2 Letterkenny wants to go hunting for buried treasure. <STOP> <START> Bonnie! <STOP> <START> Bonnie! <STOP> <START> Did ya feed the dog? <START> Yes! <STOP> <START> Oh, well, thank you. <STOP> <START> Jim Dickins, how are you now? <STOP> <START> Good, and you? <STOP> <START> Oh, not so bad. <STOP> <START> McMurray, how are. <STOP> <START> Wayne, how are. <STOP> <START> Well, good. <STOP> <START> Well, I'm good and. <STOP> <START> I'm not so. <STOP> <START> Oh, not so. <STOP> <START> Uh. <STOP> <START> Not so bad. <STOP> <START> Go ahead. <START> You, you were first so. <STOP> <START> No, why don't you go ahead? <STOP> <START> Oh, I didn't want to be impolite. <STOP> <START> Just start talking, please, McMurray. <STOP> <START> So you can go ahead and start. <STOP> <START> If you're going to go first, then it would be your turn. <STOP> <START> Just pretend what I had to say wasn't important. <START> You're here to pitch, are you not? <STOP> <START> Are you sure you don't want to say anything? <STOP> <START> Jesus, PitterPatter, McMurray! <STOP> <START> Good enough. <STOP> <START> Have at 'er. <START> Yip, yip, yip. <STOP> <START> Now, we are asking for five K for 5% of our business. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> We want to give back to the community by helping them cocksuckers get rich. <STOP> <START> Uncle Eddie used to buy lottery tickets for the seniors at the home every week. <STOP> <START> MRS. <STOP> <START> And we want to goddamn do that by auctioning off other people's shit. <STOP> <START> Bingo. <STOP> <START> Did you know that there are storage facilities surrounding Letterkenny that are filled with other people's useless piles of their shit, that they have forgotten about? <STOP> <START> Abandoned it, baby. <STOP> <START> They abandoned their shit. <STOP> <START> Abandoned their shit. <STOP> <START> Now, whose knob do I got to polish to get a cocksucking gin and tonic around here? <STOP> <START> All right. <STOP> <START> We have secured the auctioneering right for these such storage facilities with the help of our friend, Jimmy Dickskin. <STOP> <START> Dickins. <STOP> <START> That's exactly what I said. <STOP> <START> So, what we want to do is we want to take people down there and have them rummage through all the shit and then buy some of the stuff and probably, more than likely, most definitely, find hidden treasures, gold and jewels. <STOP> <START> And I'd settle for a Tom Collins, if it'll get this rig rolling. <STOP> <START> So, you want to sell other people's shit that they left in their storage locker. <STOP> <START> Abandoned. <STOP> <START> Abandoned. <STOP> <START> Things that they abandoned. <STOP> <START> But it's a storage locker and nobody's got any good shit in there. <START> You would be surprised. <STOP> <START> I'm never surprised. <STOP> <START> Well, you will be once we show you a demonstration of one such storage locker that we have brought down from the tiny town of Tiverton. <STOP> <START> Baby, if you will. <STOP> <START> Shall I call you Vanna, for a little roleplay? <STOP> <START> Uhhuh, baby, you know what I mean? <STOP> <START> All right, and a one, and a two, and a three, Jimmy Dickskin! <STOP> <START> Got a beautiful set of DVDs. <STOP> <START> To start the bidding. <STOP> <START> DVDs galore, look at that.
