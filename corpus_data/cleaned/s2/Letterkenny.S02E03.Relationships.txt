Katy. <START> I forgot to tell her not to tell you that. <START> So, I've modeled my business after the charming story that it's inspired by. <START> I send my clients on three dates, and like the beds that Goldilocks laid down in after eating the three bears' porridge, maybe one is "too hard," and maybe one is "too soft." But in the end we hope that maybe one is just right. <START> Katy. <START> Get after it. <START> You're losin' him. <START> Okay. <START> Wayne, why don't you just tell me a little bit about yourself. <START> It's impolite to talk about yourself. <START> Keeps his truck clean. <START> Loves his dogs. <START> Enjoys a beer and a smoke. <START> Beer. <START> Beer and smoke. <START> That's. <START> Wow, you know. <START> I get it. <START> Rustic. <START> Trucks, got it. <START> We will make this work. <START> I love it, okay. <START> And then, um, Wayne, can you just tell me a little bit about your past relationship? <START> You shouldn't air your dirty laundry. <START> Five years. <START> Ended a while ago. <START> No baggage. <START> No baggage, love that. <START> No baggage, no babies. <START> Likey. <START> This is fun. <START> I'm having a fun time in this place. <START> And, Wayne, can you tell me how much you make in a fiscal year?. <START> Katy! <START> It's impolite to talk about your money. <START> He's no slouch. <START> Okay. <START> Touche. <START> Well, I'm about to begin your story. <START> Where maybe one is "too hard." Maybe one is, um. <START> But in the end. <START> Yeah, you lost him. <START> He seems. <START> He seems nice. <START> Do you live. <START> Do you live in here? <START> So, what did you think of Goldilocks and the Three Dates there, Wayne? <START> Ready to fall in Goldilove? <START> Or Goldilust? <START> You won't be Goldilaughin' when I break your Goldilegs. <START> Dim the Goldilights? <START> Nights of your Goldilife? <START> Use your Goldilanguage. <START> Make her Goldilaugh. <START> Make it Goldilast. <START> Better Goldilay off, before they find your Goldilimbs in a Goldilandfill, Goldiliterally. <START> Take her on a Goldilunch? <START> Maybe a Goldilate suppers? <START> Maybe she's a Goldilawyer. <START> Ooh. <START> You think I'm Goldilyin'? <START> Enough Goldilip. <START> A Goldilongshoresman will find your bodies in the Goldilake! <START> Gentlemen, a question. <START> A query. <START> An inquis. <START> Pitter patter. <START> Has Katy mentioned anything about me not talking to her? <START> Can confirm. <START> Major league. <START> It's working. <START> What's working? <START> By not talking to her, she will form the conclusion that I'm upset with her and eventually ask me why. <START> Why you so butthurt, Stewart? <START> Well, she acts like. <START> Just kidding. <START> I don't give a fuck.  Wait. <START> So, you're upsets with her, and you wanna communicate that by not communicatings? <START> Acutely. <START> You are spare parts, aren't you, bud? <START> Let me know if Katy asks about me. <START> Heads up! <START> Ow! <START> I'm Kim. <START> I'm a psychologist and a feminist. <START> I'll be paying the bill. <START> I'm Wayne. <START> Wayne! <START> Glen. <START> How are you now? <START> Ah, good and you? <START> Oh, not so bad. <START> Well, I guess the kitten's out of the clutch on this one. <START> I also have to work as a waitress to make ends meet.  Sure you do. <START> I'm Kim. <START> Are you ever. <START> Look at you. <START> I'm lovin' this. <START> You're like a shark. <START> I'm scared. <START> Like a Julie Moore, or like a Jessie Chastain. <START> What can I get you to drink? <START> Uh, we'll need a minute. <START> Uh, please and thank you. <START> Hmm. <START> All right. <START> Well, you'll take care of little Miss Nicki Kidman here till I get back, Mr. <START> McConaughey? <START> Sure, I will. <START> All right. <START> He crosses his arms. <START> Are you aware of the psychology behind that? <START> Now, when you say "he," you're talking about me, right? <START> He has wit. <START> Do you know why you cross your arms? <START> Feels like you're talking to two people right now. <START> Crossing your arms, whether it be consciously or subconsciously, is a sign of defense. <START> You're protecting your vital organs. <START> Do you feel threatened by me? <START> Well, I don't, but the other guy might. <START> He is hilarious. <START> Enough psychology for now. <START> What do you know about feminism, Wayne? <START> I know it's unsafe territory to discuss with a feminist. <START> Why? <START> Someone will start shoutin'. <START> Why? <START> I don't know. <START> Feminism is the belief that women and men should have equal rights and opportunities. <START> So, are you a feminist, Wayne? <START> Well, I trust my sister with just about any job under the sun over a man. <START> But 'cept this one, I guess. <START> Excuse me? <START> Not to be impolite but you're not exposed to talk about sex, politics or religion at the supper table. <START> What do you want, Wayne? <START> I'd have a Gus'n Bru, likely. <START> Not what I'm asking. <START> What's a Gus'n Bru? <START> Ooh! <START> I'll google it and find out. <START> I'm kiddin'. <START> I know exactly what it is. <START> But we don't have any. <START> So, what can I get you to drink? <START> I'll have a Caesar and he'll have a. <START> Pint of lager, please. <START> Something local. <START> Thank you.  All right. <START> So, a local lager for Mr. <START> Brando and a Caesar for Sandy Bullock. <START> I love those orders. <START> Be right back. <START> I didn't think they'd have it at Four Dancers. <START> Yes, I didn't think they'd have it at this restobar. <START> Gastropub. <START> Says "restobar" on the sign. <START> It's more of a microbistro. <START> Says brasserie on the menu right there, too. <START> It's more of a bistrobrasserie. <START> When I came in they asked me if I wanted to sit at the restobar or the gastrolounge. <START> I'm glad you chose the restobar. <START> This is actually the gastrolounge. <START> Do you know what an emergency call is, Wayne? <START> Negative. <START> It's when you have a friend call 10, 15 minutes into a date to be sure the date isn't a total bust. <START> And if it is, then you can play the phone call as though it's an emergency and leave the date. <START> Well, that's fair. <START> I guess we are first cousin to an emergency here. <START> A good one. <START> And you shouldn't be afraid of it. <START> I think we could do good things here. <START> I'm going to call my friend and cancel her pending emergency call, and when I get back, let's talk about your feelings, Wayne. <START> Okay. <START> Let's really talk about them. <START> Okay. <START> I wanna take 'em, and I wanna talk about them. <START> Oh, it's Wayne. <START> How are you now? <START> Oh, not so bad. <START> Yeah, this one's too hard. <START> We don't have time to discuss that business. <START> Devon. <START> Stewart. <START> I come in peace. <START> How do we know you don't have another one of those in your sock? <START> You don't. <START> Speak. <START> Do not approach. <START> Seen Katy around? <START> No. <START> That is all.  Stewart! <START> Trouble in paradise? <START> If there was, she wouldn't know it. <START> I'm not talking to her. <START> Well played. <START> Wait it out. <START> That way she'll come to the conclusion that you're upset with her and ask you why. <START> Precisely. <START> She should anyway. <START> If she's smart. <START> I know. <START> Why are you mad at her? <START> She acts like. <START> You should try an open relationship. <START> Could be productive. <START> You could also try a hall pass. <START> It's when you give, you know, her being allowed to sleep with one person and that's it, no questions asked. <START> Another plausibly fruitful option. <START> New GTA and COD out today. <START> We're going to sesh. <START> Been gaming much? <START> Always gaming. <START> You? <START> Just gamed. <START> Stimulating morning game. <START> Evening game will eclipse. <START> I gamed a 00to00 shift last night. <START> You're gaming taxi driver's hours? <START> I gamed a 00to00 shift today. <START> Gaming banker's hours. <START> I'll probably game a 00to00 shift now. <START> Cinq a sept. <START> Nous aussi. <START> You guys wanna hit up a happy hour? <START> We're gonna hit another happy hour. <START> Heads up!  Ow!  I'm Lisa. <START> Wayne. <START> Wayne! <START> Glen, how are you now? <START> Good and you? <START> Not so bad. <START> Well, I guess the teddy's out of the tickle trunk on this one, too. <START> I also work here. <START> Reason is the Salty Treat blew out an amp the other day, rockin' out pretty hard to some Lifehouse covers, which will happen. <START> So, I'm pickin' up the slack. <START> I'm happy to do it. <START> Way she goes. <START> I'm Lisa. <START> Are you ever. <START> Look at you! <START> It's America's little sweetheart over here. <START> You're like a little Katy Heigl or like a little Katy Hudson. <START> What can I get ya? <START> Do you have cookies and cream? <START> Do I. <START> Do I have cookies and cream? <START> I sure do have cookies and cream. <START> And I'm thinkin' maybe a vanillafudge swirl chunk for Mr. <START> Newman over here? <START> That'll do, thank you. <START> Okay. <START> And you're gonna keep an eye on little Caty Blanchett here for me till I get back? <START> Sure will. <START> Thank you! <START> Be right back! <START> So, you're a farmer, Wayne? <START> Can confirm. <START> You don't smell like one. <START> I'm kidding. <START> I'm a preschool principal. <START> Do you like kids? <START> Hmm. <START> I know, everyone likes kids. <START> They're so silly. <START> I love them when they're silly. <START> But if they get too silly, they have to come see me. "Silly"? <START> Mischief. <START> Trouble. <START> We use gentler terms. <START> As a policy. <START> Well, so what happens when they come see you? <START> Well, we do things a little differently in our program. <START> The approach is progressive and positive. <START> We issue a hug consent form to parents, which allows us to hug their kids. <START> Because 99% of the time, all kids need is a hug. "A hug"? <START> A squeeze. <START> Well, you squeeze 'em. <START> An embrace. <START> Oh. <START> Oh? <START> Well. <START> What is it? <START> Nothin'. <START> Wayne. <START> Yeah? <START> Speak freely. <START> No, I'd better not. <START> That's the only way we'll get to know each other. <START> But do you ever smack 'em? <START> Excuse me? <START> Like, give 'em a good whack? <START> I don't follow. <START> Do you ever hit the kid? <START> Like, for being too silly. <START> No! <START> Wayne. <START> We never hit our kids. <START> You shouldn't hit kids. <START> Well, you know what, don't you remember how scared you were of your principal when you were growing up? <START> It's 'cause he'd smack you if you were being too silly. <START> Like your parents wanted you to have a principal who would smack you. <START> They took comfort in the fact that they were sending you to a place every day where someone would smack you for them if you were being too silly. <START> And sometimes I see kids these days, I kind of think, like. <START> Like, wish you could still do that. <START> That sort of discipline is long outdated, Wayne, and frowned upon. <START> We sit the child down. <START> That's another problem. <START> What is? <START> In my opinion. <START> Sitting? <START> Well, no wonder kids are failin' school, just sittin' around all day. <START> Stand up, you're not doing nothin'. <START> You think sitting is a problem? <START> Yeah. <START> Why? 'Cause it makes you soft. <START> Literally or figuratively? <START> Well, both, I suppose. <START> Both? <START> Yeah. <START> In my opinion. <START> My phone's buzzing. <START> Well, so you like cookies and cream ice cream, hey? <START> Well, I think it's pretty good, too. <START> Hi, Michelle. <START> Oh, no. <START> Okay, I'll be right there. <START> I'm sorry, Wayne, I've gotta go. <START> It's. <START> An emergency. <START> Yeah. <START> Okay. <START> It's Wayne. <START> Well, how are you now? <START> Oh, not so bad. <START> Yeah, this one's too soft. <START> What? <START> I'm not talking to you. <START> Super.  It's been three days. <START> Why haven't you asked me what's wrong? <START> Something wrong? <START> Of course it is. <START> You act like I don't. <START> Should I have known that? <START> It's called "the silent treatment." Step one, I stop talking to you. <START> Step two, you form the conclusion that something is wrong. <START> Step three, you ask me what's wrong. <START> What's up with step one? <START> You've skipped step one and two. <START> What's step three again? <START> You ask me what's wrong! <START> Got it. <START> Good. <START> You bet. <START> Go ahead. <START> Where? <START> Step three. <START> What's step three again? <START> We'll skip step three. <START> I'm just going to tell you what's wrong. <START> That should have been step one. <START> Wrong. <START> Step one and two are fundamental steps. <START> You missed steps, Stewart. <START> How? <START> Step one, become angry with someone. <START> Step two, tell that someone that you're angry. <START> Step three, resolve anger with that someone. <START> Step four.  Step four. <START> Step four, resume peaceful existence. <START> Your logic is frighteningly bewitching. <START> Phantasmagoric. <START> It's time for you to go. <START> What? <START> Where? <START> Leave here? <START> It was a rebound. <START> Even though there was no physical act of rebounding, which is a first for me. <START> Gross. <START> Seriously, Katy. <START> W5. <START> No one has time for the silent treatment, Stewart. <START> Not even in Letterkenny. <START> Adios.  Heads up!  Nice try, shirttuckers! <START> Ow! <START> Hi, Wayne. <START> Angie. <START> Wayne! <START> Oh, my gourd, what a coincidence. <START> Oh, I bet you're thinkin' I work here. <START> I don't work here. <START> I just love Guy's fries. <START> They're so crispy, and you add a little salt. <START> I just think they're so delicious. <START> Ooh! <START> Who is this? <START> You're a masterpiece, aren't ya? <START> You're like a Shelly Pfeiffer, you're like a Charlie Theron, or like a Penny Cruz. <START> Ooh! <START> You're like a little Angie Jolie. <START> That's who you are, you're Angie. <START> How are you now? <START> Good and you? <START> Not so bad. <START> Can we talk? <START> Okay. "Talk." In your truck. <START> Okay. <START> Now that was just right. <START> So how did you make out, super chief? <START> Did you find the missing Goldilink? <START> You fallin' in Goldilove? <START> It's better to Goldilet this go, before I Goldilose my shit. <START> Oh, take your drink, you Goldilush. <START> Tread Goldilightly. <START> So, that's no toecurlin' then? <START> It's impolite to kiss and tell. <START> Nothin' wrong with a little stank on the hang down. <START> Nothin' wrong with a little takesin' out in the trades. <START> A little hizzin' in the skizzins. <START> No, I know there's nothin' wrong with a little goin' to the bone yard, I know that. <START> Nothin' wrong with a little bacon makin'. <START> Nothin' wrong with a little shot twixt winds and waters. <START> A little building the blanket monster. <START> I know there's nothin' wrong with a little pituitary poke. <START> I know that. <START> Nothin' wrong with a little makin' the beast with two backs. <START> Makin' feet for children's stockin's. <START> Testing the tube steak. <START> Look, I know there's nothin' wrong with a little crawl up the skin slide. <START> I know that. <START> Nothin' wrong with a little, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!" Now just pump the brakes right there. <START> I got a question. <START> Have at 'er. <START> Then I got a comment. <START> Well, let's hear it, good buddy. <START> Now, my question. <START> When have you ever heard a girl go, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes." Well. <START> Other than in a porno. <START> I don't believe I have. <START> Me neithers. <START> That's because we don't say that. <START> Well. <START> Not unless it's in a porno. <START> Now my comment. <START> You see, the way Dary did the "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's" is not the way they do the "yes, yes, yes" in pornos. <START> That's the way they do it. <START> The girl gets all excited, and she goes, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes." <START> Yes, but the way you're doing the "yes, yes, yes, yes's" is not the way they do the "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.". <START> It is the way they do it. <START> They go, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes." That's exactly how they do it. <START> No, they don't. <START> What they do is they find a superhigh pitch for those first four yes's. <START> And then they come in all dramatic for that final "yes." So, it goes a little something like, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes." And then they get all dramatic for that final "yes." Say, "<START> Yes! <START> Oh." I don't think that's how they do it. <START> I'd have to hears it again. "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!" <START> Yeah. <START> Yeah, porno girls do that. <START> But only when the porno guys aren't busy finding some superlow tone and repeating over and over again, "Ah, fuck. "Ah, fuck." I takes a bit offense to that, Miss Katy, as I have a naturally low voice, and I do likes to say, "Ah, fuck. "Ah, fuck." Exceptin' I don't do it in pornos. <START> Well, then you should do voiceovers for Englishdubbed foreign pornos, Dan, because that was a text book "ah, fuck, ah, fuck." Why thank you, Miss Katy. <START> I've never had any complaints from any of my sexual companions about my "ah, fuck, ah, fuck.". <START> Let me hear yours, Dary. <START> Well, I. <START> I'm confused still on the "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's." So, Wayne, it's like, uh, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"? <START> See, it's not as if it's a fuckin' question, Dary, is it? <START> You're saying it like it's a question. <START> So, it's like, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes." <START> You're gettin closer, Dary, but what you want to do is put a little pepper on the end of it. <START> You just want to put a little pepper on the end of it. <START> Like, "<START> Yes!"
