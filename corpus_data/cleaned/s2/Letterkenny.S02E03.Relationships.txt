Step one, I stop talking to you. <STOP> <START> Step two, you form the conclusion that something is wrong. <STOP> <START> Step three, you ask me what's wrong. <STOP> <START> What's up with step one? <START> You've skipped step one and two. <STOP> <START> What's step three again? <START> You ask me what's wrong! <STOP> <START> Got it. <STOP> <START> Good. <START> You bet. <STOP> <START> Go ahead. <STOP> <START> Where? <STOP> <START> Step three. <STOP> <START> What's step three again? <STOP> <START> We'll skip step three. <STOP> <START> I'm just going to tell you what's wrong. <STOP> <START> That should have been step one. <STOP> <START> Wrong. <STOP> <START> Step one and two are fundamental steps. <START> You missed steps, Stewart. <STOP> <START> How? <STOP> <START> Step one, become angry with someone. <STOP> <START> Step two, tell that someone that you're angry. <STOP> <START> Step three, resolve anger with that someone. <STOP> <START> Step four.

In your truck. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Now that was just right. <STOP> <START> So how did you make out, super chief? <STOP> <START> Did you find the missing Goldilink? <START> You fallin' in Goldilove? <STOP> <START> It's better to Goldilet this go, before I Goldilose my shit. <STOP> <START> Oh, take your drink, you Goldilush. <STOP> <START> Tread Goldilightly. <STOP> <START> So, that's no toecurlin' then? <STOP> <START> It's impolite to kiss and tell. <STOP> <START> Nothin' wrong with a little stank on the hang down. <STOP> <START> Nothin' wrong with a little takesin' out in the trades. <STOP> <START> A little hizzin' in the skizzins. <STOP> <START> No, I know there's nothin' wrong with a little goin' to the bone yard, I know that. <STOP> <START> Nothin' wrong with a little bacon makin'. <STOP> <START> Nothin' wrong with a little shot twixt winds and waters. <STOP> <START> A little building the blanket monster. <STOP> <START> I know there's nothin' wrong with a little pituitary poke. <STOP> <START> I know that. <STOP> <START> Nothin' wrong with a little makin' the beast with two backs. <STOP> <START> Makin' feet for children's stockin's. <STOP> <START> Testing the tube steak. <STOP> <START> Look, I know there's nothin' wrong with a little crawl up the skin slide. <STOP> <START> I know that. <STOP> <START> Nothin' wrong with a little, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!" Now just pump the brakes right there. <STOP> <START> I got a question. <STOP> <START> Have at 'er. <STOP> <START> Then I got a comment. <STOP> <START> Well, let's hear it, good buddy. <STOP> <START> Now, my question. <STOP> <START> When have you ever heard a girl go, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes." Well. <STOP> <START> Other than in a porno. <STOP> <START> I don't believe I have. <STOP> <START> Me neithers. <STOP> <START> That's because we don't say that. <STOP> <START> Well. <STOP> <START> Not unless it's in a porno. <STOP> <START> Now my comment. <START> You see, the way Dary did the "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's" is not the way they do the "yes, yes, yes" in pornos. <STOP> <START> That's the way they do it. <STOP> <START> The girl gets all excited, and she goes, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes." <START> Yes, but the way you're doing the "yes, yes, yes, yes's" is not the way they do the "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.". <STOP> <START> It is the way they do it. <STOP> <START> They go, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes." That's exactly how they do it. <STOP> <START> No, they don't. <STOP> <START> What they do is they find a superhigh pitch for those first four yes's. <STOP> <START> And then they come in all dramatic for that final "yes." So, it goes a little something like, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes." And then they get all dramatic for that final "yes." Say, "<START> Yes! <STOP> <START> Oh." I don't think that's how they do it. <STOP> <START> I'd have to hears it again. "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!" <START> Yeah. <START> Yeah, porno girls do that. <STOP> <START> But only when the porno guys aren't busy finding some superlow tone and repeating over and over again, "Ah, fuck. "Ah, fuck." I takes a bit offense to that, Miss Katy, as I have a naturally low voice, and I do likes to say, "Ah, fuck. "Ah, fuck." Exceptin' I don't do it in pornos. <STOP> <START> Well, then you should do voiceovers for Englishdubbed foreign pornos, Dan, because that was a text book "ah, fuck, ah, fuck." Why thank you, Miss Katy. <STOP> <START> I've never had any complaints from any of my sexual companions about my "ah, fuck, ah, fuck.". <STOP> <START> Let me hear yours, Dary. <STOP> <START> Well, I. <STOP> <START> I'm confused still on the "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's." So, Wayne, it's like, uh, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"? <STOP> <START> See, it's not as if it's a fuckin' question, Dary, is it? <START> You're saying it like it's a question. <STOP> <START> So, it's like, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes." <START> You're gettin closer, Dary, but what you want to do is put a little pepper on the end of it. <START> You just want to put a little pepper on the end of it. <STOP> <START> Like, "<START> Yes!" "<START> Yes!" "Ah, fuck." It's like, "<START> Yes, yes, yes." "Ah, fuck." ".yes, yes, yes!" "Ah, fuck." Like, "<START> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!" "<START> Yes!" Just having a fight with my hat.  "Oh, my God." "Oh, my God!" "Feels really good." "Oh, my God. <STOP> <START> Oh, my God. <STOP> <START> Oh, my God." "Oh, my God! "Oh, my God! "Oh, my God!" Three praccys a week, buddy? <STOP> <START> Three praccys a week in SeniorA whale shit, buddy. <STOP> <START> Half these guys wheel their fuckin' bags into the rink. <STOP> <START> The day I fuckin' wheel my bag into the rink is the day I stop playing hockey. <STOP> <START> Afuckin'men, buddy. <STOP> <START> Why do we even praccy, buddy? <STOP> <START> Should be rippin' sandos. <STOP> <START> See me toss the sauce in the skates all night long, buddy? <STOP> <START> Just tossin' rocket sauce straight into the blades, boys. <STOP> <START> I don't even know what a tapetotaper is anymore. <STOP> <START> Not sure what a tapetotaper is anymore, buddy. <STOP> <START> Fuck tapetotapers, buddy. <STOP> <START> Fuck tapers. <STOP> <START> I fired a pointblank clap bomb directly into Barts's chest tonight. <STOP> <START> Fired a pointblank point bomb straight in <START> Yorkie's junk. <STOP> <START> I snowed our plug tendy no less than nine times. <STOP> <START> I snowshowered our plug tendy and that was his own "D," man. <STOP> <START> Praccy's not badski when you're donkin'. <STOP> <START> I could donk all day, boys.
