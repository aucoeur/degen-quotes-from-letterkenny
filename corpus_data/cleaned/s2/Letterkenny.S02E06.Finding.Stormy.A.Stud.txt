<START> You're having thirsty Thursday with your pals the other day. <START> It was my cousin's sixth birthday party yesterday. <START> Which cousin? <START> Samuel. <START> I fuckin' hate Samuel. <START> Well, Samuel likes you. <START> Fuckin' hate Samuel so much. <START> Well, Samuel's not so bad. <START> I seen Samuel in the laundry room with the cat one time. <START> You just know that little fucker's gonna put him in the dryer. <START> That's a hasty conclusion. <START> Not if you seen Samuel trying to put himself in there 15 minutes earlier. <START> I seen Samuel snort a line of Fun Dip on his fifth birthday. <START> Well, it's reason fuckin' five million I didn't go to his sixth birthday party. <START> He was doing a Fun Dip dry rip. <START> A what? <START> Or rippsin' a Fun Dip dry one. <START> Well, what's that? <START> Well, in schneef terms, if you do a line of schneef before you've ingested any booze to alter your judgment, it's called doing a dry rip. <START> Or rippsin' a dry one. <START> Doin' dry rips is a pretty good indication you got a schneef problem. <START> You got yourselves a schneef issue. <START> Well, yous ever done a dry rip? <START> Well, back in the day. <START> In the glory days. <START> Yeah, I done a dry rip. <START> I'd a rips a dry one. <START> Not sure if rippin' a Fun dip dry rip would have the same effect, but doin' it is still a pretty good indication you got some sort of problem. <START> Well, hoopin' Fun Dip definitely wouldn't have the same effects, but it's definitely an indication you got yourselves a problem. <START> Well, what's hoopin'? <START> Well, that's instead of taking the drugs orally's or intranasally's, you take 'em anally's. <START> What the fuck you talking about now? <START> Well, instead of down the hatch or up the nose, you take 'em in the pooper. <START> Wait, you put drugs up your pooper? <START> That's the fastest way to absorbs 'em into your systems. <START> Do you mean like you take the drugs with your hand. <START> Well, then you put 'em up your pooper? <START> Correct. <START> But you don't poop 'em out? <START> No, your pooper absorbs 'em. <START> Well, isn't that curious. <START> Hoopin' Fun Dip definitely wouldn't have the same effect as hoopin' schneef. <START> But doing it is still probably a pretty good indication you got some sort of a problem. <START> I guess a Fun Dip dick dinger wouldn't be the ends of the world. <START> You wanna know what? <START> I heard my friends J. <START> P. and J. <START> W. talk about Fun Dip dick dingers one time. <START> Well, whose dick was gettin' dinged? <START> Well, I thought it was a bit intrusive to ask whose dick was gettin' dinged. <START> As long as they're both consentin' adults, it really doesn't matter whose dick's gettin' dinged. <START> Well, I really hope the Fun Dip candy stick isn't going to waste in all this. <START> Do you wanna know what? <START> I pulled my first allnighter with my friend Chad in grade eight playing Pokemans and eating Fun Dip. <START> Oh, waits. <START> If. <START> If Samuel's already been takin' Fun Dips orally's and intranasally's. <START> Yeah, we should probably go check on Samuel. <START> I fuckin' hate Samuel so much. <START> You got any dates lined up this week, good buddy? <START> Nah, I'm gonna put that bullshit on the back burner for a bit, bud. <START> Soft, literally. <START> Parks 'er behind the barn for a bits? <START> Tenply. <START> No. <START> Gotta find Stormy a stud. <START> That's a priority. <START> She's a beautiful dog. <START> Oh, she's a real beauty. <START> No, she's a gorgeous dog. <START> She just tries to kill her studs, is the thing. <START> Well, that's my girl. <START> Maybe you should takes her in for a fingers in the bum. <START> Are you fuckin' preoccupied? <START> That's only the answer sometimes. <START> Squirrelly Dan working' Squirrelly OT. <START> Not all the time. <START> Just to checks. <START> Sometimes. <START> Are you fuckin' preoccupied? <START> Doesn't matter what you takes her in for. <START> As sure as a bush is gonna break your fall, Stormy's gonna get some fingers in the bum. <START> How deep? <START> Fuck's sake. <START> What do ya means, how deep? <START> How many knuckles? <START> Like how many knuckles deep? <START> Yeah, are we talking about a oneknuckler or a twoknuckler? <START> Oh, be at least a threeknuckler to gets to the bottom of this. <START> Oh, see, now, that's too many. <START> Is not. <START> Well, a person's got two knuckles so you're saying that the vet would have to fire a threeknuckler up Stormy's bum to get to the bottom of it? <START> A person has three knuckles. <START> Well, a person has two knuckles. <START> Figure it out. <START> A person has three knuckles. <START> You figure it out. <START> A person's got two knuckles, okay? <START> One, two. <START> Three. <START> You forgots about the little knuckles underneath the fingernails. <START> Well, see now, that's not a knuckle, though, Dan. <START> To be a knuckle, you gotta be able to punch somebody with it. <START> You can't punch somebody with the knuckle underneath the fingernail, can you? <START> Can too. <START> Well, you'll be looking pretty fuckin' silly. <START> First knuckle, one knuckler. <START> Second knuckle, twoknuckler. <START> Third knuckle, threeknuckler. <START> So then by your logic the vet would have to fire a full finger up Stormy's bum to get to the bottom of it. <START> Correct. <START> See, I'm just not so goddamn sure I can stand by and watch the vet give Stormy a threeknuckler up the bum. <START> No, I don't think Stormy would need a threeknuckler up the bum. <START> Well, thank you, Dary, because then you'd think the vet's a bit funny, would you not? <START> Mmm, a person has three knuckles, though. <START> Thank you, Dary. <START> Fuck's sake, go ahead and have a fuckin' fight with your first knuckle then. <START> You'll be lookin' pretty fuckin' silly. <START> Yeah, but when we're talkin' about a twoknuckler, we're talking about horizontal knuckles. <START> I'm gonna stop you there. <START> By your logic, a sixknuckler can be dealt with using these two fingers? <START> Correct. <START> Incorrect. <START> No such thing as a sixknuckler. <START> A sixknuckler existed, I'd know about it. <START> How are ya now, Gail? <START> Good, and you? <START> Not so bad. <START> Got a stud for Stormy. <START> Comes from the Baumgartner breeders. <START> Name's Ken. <START> Ken Baumgartner? <START> Yeah. <START> Okay. <START> You're not exposed to give dogs human names. <START> Can do what I want. <START> Well, sure you can, I'm just sayin' you're not exposed to. <START> Baumgartner's been breeding German Shepherds out in Chemmy for six years. <START> Champion bloodlines. <START> Elegance. <START> Strength. <START> Raw food diet. <START> You got him in the truck? <START> Yeah. <START> Well, pull around back. <START> See if they'll have a go. <START> Okay. <START> Hey, Dan. <START> Do you wanna know how I know about a sixknuckler? <START> Okay. <START> Reilly. <START> Jonesy. <START> You guys been gettin' a lot of ice time?

Why? 'Cause it's funnier. <START> I think. <START> It's kinda like that word "queef." See, you can have a lot of fun with that word queef. <START> But what's funnier, well, I think, is the word "quiff."
