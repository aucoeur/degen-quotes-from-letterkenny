<START> We do not have the native flu. <START> We do not have the native flu. <START> Don't be scared to admits it. <START> Those natives are tough as hell. <START> Yeah, those natives are tougher than hell. <START> Look, we can handle the natives in the rink, boys. <START> We know we got business in their barn, boys. <START> But Tanis and her troops are gonna be waiting for us in the parking lot, so we. <START> We need back up, boys. <START> Hard no. <START> Aw, come on. <START> Where's your jam, bud? <START> Not my pig. <START> Not my farm. <START> Where's the sacrifice? <START> Oh, get off the cross, we need the wood. <START> We tuned 'em up on our turf just a fortnights ago. <START> Yeah, we step back on theirs now, that's a suicide mission. <START> Mmm. <START> I heard Tanis wants the ban on Letterkenny lifted, too. <START> Then she shouldn't have burned down the fuckin' produce stand. <START> Come on. <START> Where's your goddamn hustle, bud? <START> Let's see the hustle, boys. <START> When a man asks you for help, you help him. <START> PitterPatter. <START> Well, I guess I haven't been in a scrap in a while. <START> We could go get bags of darts, too. <START> And their venison pepperettes are not to be missed. <START> I pert near popped a street meat vendor outside of a Jays' game one time for sellin' me a venison dog. <START> Ain't no goatdagoddamn way that's venison dogs. <START> No. <START> Well. <START> I'd go for a scrap. <START> We'll need reinforcements. <START> Joint Boy? <START> Yeah, you could call JB. <START> What about. <START> No. <START> Oh, you mean the Ginger? <START> Hard no. <START> But? <START> Now, everybody listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once, we never talk about it again. <START> You understand? <START> We all lay off the Ginger and Boots now. <START> Because the Ginger and Boots did not fuck an ostrich. <START> Yeah, I heard they fucked two ostriches. <START> Allegedly. <START> Folks'll say that it takes two people to fuck an ostrich. <START> Three even. <START> Folks are also saying that it was a sick ostrich. <START> Allegedly. <START> Now, I went on the Internet and researched ostriches. <START> Firstly, ostriches can run up to 70 miles an hour. <START> So catching one, even a sick one, is a super tall order. <START> Yeah, but there was two of them. <START> Secondly, when a male ostrich, it's called a cock, fights over a female ostrich, they're called a hen, they're known to kill each other by head butting. <START> Probably should wear hockey helmets. <START> Hockey helmets, buddy. <START> Well, they'd need a race car helmet, likely. <START> Finally, ostriches use their legs to defend from predators. <START> And can use them to kill even their largest and most deadly enemies, which are fuckin' lions. <START> That's the king of the jungle. <START> Still just a cat. <START> So you'll see there is no way the Ginger and Boots could have fucked an ostrich. <START> Maybe they tranqed the ostrich. <START> Like they roofie'd the ostrich?. <START> You wanna know what? <START> You should feel bad about even suggesting that the Ginger and Boots fucked an ostrich. <START> Bad gas travels real fast in a small town. <START> My research concludes that the only way the Ginger and Boots could have fucked an ostrich is if it was a dead ostrich. <START> Ginger and Boots. a dead ostrich? <START> I thought it was just sick! <START> Oh, my! <START> Ginny? <START> The Ginger and Boots effed a dead ostrich. <START> Oh, bother. <START> Of course I know what the male ones are called! <START> Check my browser history. <START> Don't show her weakness, Stewart. <START> I'm not. <START> I'm sun burnt. <START> Hey, you! <START> Hey, you. <START> This is awkward but your shirt seems to have shrunk in the wash. <START> Not awkward. <START> Things shrink in the wash. <START> How do you explain your dick?

<START> So cool. <START> What was it? <START> Die, Die, My Darling. <START> Metallica. <START> Love 'em. <START> Actually, they have a song that reminds me of you, too. <START> Oh? <START> Yeah. <START> Sad But True. <START> Hmm. <START> Why don't you run along and get your essentials? <START> You know, long, smooth, cylindricalshaped objects. <START> Actually, I'm just looking for some threeinch screws to hang a frame. <START> Hey, you know what three inches looks like, right? <START> She skewered you! <START> Don't listen to him, Devon. <START> They wanted you to go to debate school. <START> Hey, what's up? <START> We. <START> We're just goin'. <START> Kidding! <START> I don't give a fuck. <START> Look like you got a bad case of the native flu. <START> Should've brought your fuckin' bodyguards. <START> We do not have the native flu, okay! <START> It's not the native flu! <START> Right. <START> And one tit's better than two. <START> Tanis, what we want to do is go inside, rip a couple of snap bombs and then go home. <START> Just wanna rip some snaps and bury some claps, Tanis. <START> Hack some limbs and rack some PIMS. <START> Lay beats and fill seats. <START> Yeah? <START> Yous want to get pucks deep? <START> Get pucks deep. <START> Yeah, get pucks in the net. <START> Shut the fuck up. <START> If yous think you're gonna make it into that rink, you're fuckin' stupid. <START> Do some damage, boys! <START> Wa'tsok. <START> Listen, we're four lines deep of BFI's in there ready to speed bag you space men. <START> What's a BFI? <START> Big Fuckin' Indians. <START> Not sure that's PC but you said it. <START> If you chodes walk out of there with all your chicklets, then I'm a fuckin' ferret. <START> Piss off. <START> Cool. <START> That's not cool. <START> You ready for a chin check? <START> Yup. <START> You can avoid it if you want to. <START> Nope. <START> Hmm. <START> I want the ban on Letterkenny lifted. <START> There's some good money that can be made selling smokes there. <START> Yous made your point. <START> We fucked off. <START> Point's not made yet. <START> It's not calculus. <START> Finite math is worse. <START> Trigonometry fucked me. <START> I forgot long division in grade six. <START> Okay. <START> Lift the ban on Letterkenny. <START> We'll make a buck and yous can cruise the rez. <START> Bags of darts?

<START> I'd admits it. <START> JB? <START> Would've went out my window. <START> Maybe she farted. <START> It was me. <START> Hey, since when did algebra become a quick wank? <START> I once popped my grade nine math teacher over the Pythagorean theorem. <START> Did you get expelled? <START> Just suspended. <START> Yep, called probability and statistics. <START> Like probably never gonna need them statistics in your whole life. <START> That's kind of like fractions. <START> Like multiplying and dividing them. <START> Like who the fuck's doin' that? <START> My friend David does tool and dye and he uses fractions. <START> Should have just got his fridge ticket. <START> David has his fridge ticket. <START> Then he should just drive truck. <START> Well, it's never too late to drive truck. <START> Oh! <START> Eyelash. <START> Make a wish. <START> Wish you weren't so fuckin' awkward, bud. <START> Five minutes! <START> Yup. <START> You ready, bro? <START> Born ready, buddy. <START> You stretch it out, bro? <START> Good and limber, bro. <START> I say we get a couple of shifts in before we answer the bell. <START> Get a couple of shifts in before tea time. <START> Get that first shot in and just keep goin', buddy. <START> Don't hesitate, buddy. <START> Take a shift, schmelts. <START> Ooh! <START> Pulled salad in the scrum. <START> Got a mitt full, boys. <START> You get any good shots in?

<START> Don't you fuckin' start. <START> S and P, the choice for me. <START> I paid a Chair just shy of 20 for each of these Csuckers and I will not be told how to cook 'em. <START> You paid 20 apiece for 'Berta beef? <START> Only 'Berta beef. <START> Well, no guff. <START> But I wouldn't pay 20 apiece for Japanese wagyu. <START> Always 'Berta beef. <START> Hard yes. <START> But I wouldn't pay 20 apiece for Australian wagyu. <START> Gonna want a rib eye if it's a wagyu. <START> Oneinch thick top sirloin. <START> Grill at 400. <START> Four minutes a side. <START> Down the hatch. <START> You are fuckin' up, bud. <START> That's textbook. <START> Not without the S and P. <START> Those fine ranchers in Alberta'd be a Chair away from not sendin' it here if they knew you were sprinklin' salt all over the Csuckers. <START> You're a Chair away from gettin' Csuckin' socked, good buddy. <START> Montreal steak spice really should be a part of this conversation. <START> Oneinch thick top sirloin steak. <START> Salt and pepper heavily. <START> Grill at 400. <START> Four minutes total. <START> Flip each minute to get the good grill marks. <START> Let sit for two minutes. <START> Down the hatch. <START> Flip twice. <START> Grill marks, bud. <START> Sacrilege. <START> I will strike you. <START> Blasphemy. <START> Do you wanna get striked?
