<START> You should feel bad about even suggesting that the Ginger and Boots fucked an ostrich. <STOP> <START> Bad gas travels real fast in a small town. <STOP> <START> My research concludes that the only way the Ginger and Boots could have fucked an ostrich is if it was a dead ostrich. <STOP> <START> Ginger and Boots. a dead ostrich? <STOP> <START> I thought it was just sick! <STOP> <START> Oh, my! <STOP> <START> Ginny? <STOP> <START> The Ginger and Boots effed a dead ostrich. <STOP> <START> Oh, bother. <STOP> <START> Of course I know what the male ones are called! <STOP> <START> Check my browser history. <STOP> <START> Don't show her weakness, Stewart. <STOP> <START> I'm not. <STOP> <START> I'm sun burnt. <STOP> <START> Hey, you! <STOP> <START> Hey, you. <STOP> <START> This is awkward but your shirt seems to have shrunk in the wash. <STOP> <START> Not awkward. <STOP> <START> Things shrink in the wash. <STOP> <START> How do you explain your dick?
