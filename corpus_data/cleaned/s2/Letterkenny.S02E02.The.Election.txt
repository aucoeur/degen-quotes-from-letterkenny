<START> You're having some beers in the barn with your pals the other day. <START> So, have you figured out what you're gonna do as first act of Ag Hall President there, super shoots? <START> You're looking at it, pea shoots. <START> No, he's talking about a charitable act, big shooter. <START> We'll advise you there, shoots and ladders. <START> We'll be your team, half court shooter. <START> K. <START> Like when Obamas became president, he started bringing troops home. <START> Oh, is that what he did? <START> Or when Trudeau became Prime Minister, he started bringing refugees over. <START> Oh, did he do that? <START> Whatever you do, just make sure peoples know about it. <START> Yeah, like you're gonna want to have somebody come down from the paper, take a photo of it. <START> Tweet a tweet, snap a chat. <START> Why? <START> Well, if it's not in the papers or on the Internets, it's pretty much worthless. <START> You know what I think, we should almost be snapping a chat about us talking about doing the charitables right now. <START> Pump the brakes. <START> Now, am I doing the charitables for the charity's gain or my own? <START> Well, you do the charitables for the charity, but the whole point of doing the charitables is that people think you're a good guy for being charitable. <START> Yeah, behaving charitably, you'll have people saying, like, "Oh, he's a good guy." "Oh, he's a real good guy." "Oh, he's a great guy." No! <START> I think you have had too much sugar cereal. <START> The whole point of doing the charitables is to help the charity and to make you feel good, not look good. <START> Figure it out. <START> Yeah, but it feels good to have people call you a real good guy. <START> You figure it out. <START> Oh, it feels even gooder when someone says you're a great guy. <START> You figure it out. <START> You want to do a charitable? <START> Drive into town first thing in the morning, dead of winter, after a fresh snow fall. <START> Shovel a handful of folks' driveways before they wake up. <START> No one does a tweet. <START> Feels fuckin' sweet. <START> Also, it's a substantial core workout, from what I've been told. <START> Or if you're done doing hay for the day, drive on over to someone's place that isn't done doing hay for the day, cut their grass or something like that. <START> No one snaps a chat. <START> Go fuck your hat. <START> Or couldn't you just help them do hay? <START> But gets a photo. <START> You're gonna need a photo. <START> You wanna know what? <START> No one likes a preachy Patrick, but you are pissing on the seat here. <START> Well, no one likes an impracticals Pete. <START> No one likes an unprepared Paul. <START> Or if you're a woman, no one likes an unproductive Pams. <START> Or an improper Pippa. <START> No one likes a pestering Preston. <START> Or if you're a woman, no one likes a patronizing Peggy. <START> Trust me, good buddies, any charitables act, big or small, is an act wasted if your face ain't attached to it. <START> Any charitable act? <START> Any charitables act. <START> Well, then come on, Dan. <START> Let's drive into town. <START> We'll let the dog drop a shit on Main Street and snap a chat of you picking it up. <START> Good? <START> Pitterpatter! <START> Choice work, super chief. <START> Oh, there's your lipstick. <START> Hey, 19! <START> Nice stats, no stats. <START> Scored 40 genos in the dub, onenine. <START> Sixty apples in the O, 19. <START> Lead the Q in PIMS as an overager, buddy. <START> Wheeled my buddy's billet sister. <START> Fucking 200 PIMS, boys. <START> PIMS 200 club, boys. <START> All the light bulbs don't work on the scoreboard, eh, bud? <START> A quiet night in the red light district, onenine. <START> Suck my knob. <START> Drink milk, onenine. <START> What'd they get in a trade for you, tin of chew and a half a bag of pucks? <START> Set of used practice jerseys? <START> Tub of orange slices? <START> Go carboload, 19. <START> Suck my knob, you plug. <START> Hey, Schmelts. <START> You do not get to talk to Mr. <START> Sakic. <START> Mr. <START> Sakic has earned our respect. <START> You have not earned our respect, Schmelts. <START> You do not get to talk to Mr. <START> Sakic. <START> Your first period in the league, Schmelts. <START> You'll be sent down by the second. <START> This is fantasy camp for you. <START> Hey! <START> You think you can just walk into this league and start chirping? <START> Know your role, pheasants! <START> You had a cup of coffee. <START> You're seat fillers at the ESP<START> Y's. <START> You're Tiger's caddy now that nobody gives a shit! <START> It's fucking embarrassing! <START> I don't miss playing for that guy, buddy. <START> Always a silver lining, buddy. <START> Give your balls a tug, you tit fucker! <START> The fuck did Shoresy come from? <START> I didn't even know he was here, bro. <START> Hey. <START> All this time chirping could be better spent doing legs, Schmelts. <START> Never skip leg day, Schmelts. <START> Hey, nice work on legs day today. <START> Hey, you rocked legs today, <START> Yorkie. <START> Thanks. <START> Barts, you're faster than the Russian Rocket, Pavs Bure. <START> That is where leg day got you! <START> Yorkie, statistically, Mike Gartner was faster than Bure, and that's where leg day got you. <START> Let's win it all, Barts. <START> Let's win this ship, <START> Yorkie. <START> So, from now on, you're supposed to call the police when you got worm pickers on the property, and not 911. <START> Good? <START> Now that's the business. <START> Except for that, anything pressing? <START> And she's back to choring. <START> One moment! <START> Or should I say motion. <START> McMurray, how are ya now? <START> Good n' you? <START> Not so bad. <START> Good. <START> I will speak candidly here. <START> Go ahead, baby. <START> Everybody's listening. <START> Everybody loves you. <START> All right. <START> The goings on from last week's emergency meeting left me some terrible upset. <START> Some terrible upset. <START> Oh, yeah, the ass pisses all goddamn week, that's all I know. <START> This is true. <START> I have had the ass pisses, also known as p'zazz. <START> He's been making the weakest cocksucking gin and tonics I ever goddamn had. <START> All of these events combined have brought me to one conclusion. <START> I, McMurray, motion something must be done. <START> Something has to be done. <START> A proper election must take place, whereby both Wayne and I campaign for a week to see who will be president of the Agricultural Hall. <START> I second that motion. <START> I love it when you motion. <START> I love you, too, baby. <START> Your motion. <START> All right. <START> Jimmy Dickskin, do your thing. <START> Dickins. <START> Well, that's exactly what I said. <START> Have at her, Dickskin. <START> All those in favor of a oneweek election period, give me one hand up, can we get a onedollar bill, one hand, we're looking at two. <START> Two hands up, give me two, we're looking at three, three hands up, getting to three. <START> We got three over here, we're looking at four. <START> Four hands up, we're looking at four. <START> Four over here, now we're looking at five. <START> Can I get a fivedollar bill, five over here, now we're looking at six dollar, can I get a six?

Don't know. <START> Why are you standing outside, Bonnie? <START> They crop dusted inside. <START> We crop dusted inside. <START> Super. <START> I crop dusted on the way over here, too. <START> Did you? <START> I did. <START> Very cool. <START> I know. <START> And you're single. <START> How? <START> I hate everyone. <START> Especially you. <START> Couldn't tell. <START> Oh, no? <START> No. <START> Guess I have work to do then. <START> You don't know what work is. <START> You sure do, entertaining two hockey players at the same time. <START> Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life. <START> Hmm, that's clever. <START> Isn't it? <START> I see what you did there. <START> I smell what you did there. <START> It's clear now, Katy. <START> You can come in. <START> Yeah, why don't you go in, Katy? <START> This has been a lot of fun. <START> Has been? <START> Still is. <START> Oh. <START> Fuck off, is what I meant. <START> We're busy. <START> You're busy? <START> Very. <START> Busy ripping farts in coordinated outfits at the dollar store. <START> What of it? <START> Shut up, Roald. <START> Then what? <START> Are you gonna steal some bikes and ghost ride them into the river? <START> How did she know that? <START> Shut up, Roald. <START> Maybe you could even find a new spot to rip farts in, in coordinated outfits. <START> You know, if you're not too busy. <START> Oh, we have other spots!  Roald! <START> Who's the genius behind these coordinated outfits, anyways? <START> Well, actually if you are interested. <START> Just kidding, I don't give a fuck. <START> Nice to see you, buddy. <START> Don't listen to her, Devon. <START> They wanted you to go to law school. <START> Shut up, Roald! <START> Devon! <START> Devon! <START> How are ya now? <START> Spanking! <START> Not so bad. <START> Are you the creator of Fartbook? <START> I am the sole creator of Fartbook! <START> Cocksucking love that Fartbook, that's all I know. <START> Thank you. <START> Good farts. <START> Now listen, I'm running against Wayne for the presidency of the Ag Hall and was wondering if I could commission you, and him, too, to make us a sort of a campaign video. <START> You are running against Wayne. <START> Cocksucking right, he is. <START> Hurting Wayne hurts Katy. <START> Hurting Katy hurts Stewart. <START> It can be done and it will be done! <START> Make it stop. <START> Make it stop. <START> Okay. <START> Okay. <START> All right. <START> So, look, whatever. <START> Whatever is good. <START> I just wanted to know that we're on the same page, all right? <START> I want it to be a sort of a. <START> Like a good old. <START> Smear campaign. <START> What's that? <START> It's when you run ads suggesting negative things about your opponents. <START> For what purpose? <START> To make yourself look good by making your opponent look bad. <START> Oh, if you got nothing good to say, you shouldn't say nothing at all. <START> You must acknowledge the appetite for negativity in today's world. <START> The misfortune of others, it's become sustenance. <START> You must evolve from your primitive thinking. <START> Do you remember the band Primitive Radio Gods? <START> Had that one really good song? <START> Bet it's on iTunes. <START> I hear McMurray has commissioned Devon et al, to make a video for his campaign. <START> I suggest you follow suit. <START> What sort of video? <START> A spectacle, pure adrenaline, Babylonian. <START> You're spare parts, bud. <START> Tell you what. <START> I'm gonna go into town, mow some lawns. <START> Give people one less chore to do this week. <START> Seems more productive than namecalling. <START> You wanna know what? <START> The dog's in the barn, if you wanna go hurl some insults. <START> You can get your sustenance. <START> He won't know what the fuck you're talking about anyway. <START> Have a good one. <START> Have it your way, shirttucker! (CAR DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) What is Devon up to? <START> I'm Devon, the director. <START> Okay. <START> Brown guy here. <START> Asian woman here. <START> Native man here. <START> Gail. <START> Please. <START> And the whites over there. <START> As you know, the purpose of this cinematic experience is to influence voters. <START> And we'll do that by reaching as many ethnicities as possible with our message about Wayne, which is. <START> He's just not ready. <START> That's good.  Right. <START> He's just not ready to be president of the Ag Hall. <START> Um. <START> There aren't any ethnicities on the Ag Hall board. <START> But there will be. <START> Okay, but why? <START> Because it's 2015. <START> It's not 2015. <START> And just to really hit home this whole ethnicities thing, brown guy, have you ever seen The Simpsons? <START> Yes. <START> Excellent. <START> Need you to talk like Apu, from the KwikEMart? <START> Asian woman, have you ever seen The Karate Kid? <START> Need you to talk like Mr. <START> Miyagi. "Wax on!" Native man. <START> You're pretty dialed in already. <START> Gail. <START> Where's my money, bitch? <START> Exactly. <START> And our whites are. <START> They're superwhite, so just be yourselves! <START> Thank you. <START> Where is our gay vote? <START> Tad Roald. <START> Tad. <START> Tad Roald! <START> They'd already put cheese on it, but I picked it off. <START> Tad Roald was too shy to be in our video, but said he'd organize our gay vote. <START> So where is our gay vote?  I am so sorry that I'm late, you guys. <START> Crazy story. <START> My bike chain flew right off my bike but I happened to be next to the ice cream truck. <START> So I picked myself up a little sweet treat. <START> Ha. <START> It's hot out today, don't you think, Devon? <START> Whew! <START> My. <START> No, Glen, no. <START> What? <START> Modesty. <START> Mm. <START> Disappointing. <START> Why does he have his underwear on? <START> I don't know. <START> Where's my money, bitch? <START> You spit on me. <START> You're welcome. <START> Hi, Roald. <START> As predicted, Devon's made a video. <START> The song by Primitive Radio Gods is called Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand. <START> And it is on iTunes. <START> Ah, you're not gonna like this one bit. <START> I might like it one drill bit. <START> And the message is you're just not ready. <START> Ah, it doesn't sound so bad. <START> Yes, it does! <START> So I won't like it one bell pepper. <START> Watch! <START> Hmm. <START> Looks like we got good goddamn candidates here, is all I know. <START> Let's talk about Wayne. <START> All right. <START> Under the part that says experience, it doesn't say anything about ever being president of the Agricultural Hall?  Hmm. <START> That's a hard no. <START> He'd be inheriting a lot of problems. <START> Letterkenny problems. <START> He's a farmer. <START> But has anyone ever seen him do any actual work? <START> Ah, hell, no. <START> I hear he's been cutting people's lawns. <START> Like that will stop the grass from growing? <START> Pitterpatter, let's get down to the real issues here. <START> Being President of the Ag Hall is not an entry level job. <START> How are ya now? <START> Not so qualified. <START> Can we really trust a man who can't even be bothered to wear a belt? <START> Hell to the nahnah. <START> He's just not ready. <START> He's just not ready. <START> He's just not ready. <START> He's just not ready. <START> He's just not ready. <START> He's just not ready. <START> Nice hair, though. <START> Nice ass. <START> Hmm. <START> That's what I appreciates about him. <START> He's just not ready!. <START> Wayne for president of the Ag Hall? <START> He's just not ready. <START> Oh, hell no. <START> Hmm. <START> There's a text from your mum. <START> Cream for your anal fissures is in. <START> Wha. <START> It already has 1,001 views. <START> Slightly concerning on account of there only being 5,000 people in Letterkenny. <START> We must respond posthaste. <START> Two wrongs don't make a right. <START> It's jumped 10 views since we've been conversing! 1,011. <START> This thing's going viral. <START> There could be worse things, Stewart. <START> I can beat Devon's view count. <START> I give you my personal guarantee. <START> And when I do, you won't have to sit through McMurray's pointless, purposeless, aimless, godless, motherless, meetings anymore! <START> There's something in it for both of us. <START> Now that's likely the least concerning thing on your hand, isn't it? <START> All actors are present. <START> Wondrous! <START> Why are they here? <START> Money talks. <START> He gave us 50 bucks. <START> It's like cutting twoandahalf lawns. <START> But we don't even wanna be here, boys. <START> You cheated on us, boys. <START> Oh, pipe down, Pete and Repeat. <START> You were both getting blowies from your big city slams the entire time. <START> Dude, who told her about the blowies? <START> Who blew the whistle on the blowies, bro? <START> You just did. <START> Oh, that's gutty, bro. <START> Shut the back door, bro. <START> Reilly and Jonesy, Katy, are here to help us secure the youth vote. <START> There aren't any youth voters on the Ag Hall board. <START> There will be. <START> Why? <START> Because it's 2015! <START> It's not 2015. <START> Now, gentlemen, since you are such crafty vets of the chirpslashbeak slashcarve game, I've decided to let you improvise. <START> We're really good. <START> Yeah. <START> Wayne, let's start with you. <START> Just, um, look directly into the camera and say something slanderous about McMurray. <START> Kind of feels like I should make sure my own backyard's clean before throwing junk in someone else's. <START> He slandered you first. <START> What, so you think if he goes jumps off a bridge, I'm gonna, too? <START> Figure it out. <START> Dan? <START> Daryl? <START> Please help. <START> Reilly! <START> Jonesy! <START> Let's see what you can do. <START> Okay. <START> Warm up? <START> Yeah, warm up. <START> Oh, sure. <START> Absolutely. <START> All right. . <START> The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips. <START> The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips. <START> The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips. <START> The tip of the tongue. <START> Boys! <START> Katy? <START> Girls gone wild. <START> It's not complicated! <START> We want to slander McMurray so Wayne can win the election and I can beat Devon's view count. <START> Now, let's try this. <START> Think about your favorite actor and try to channel them. <START> Who are your favorite actors? <START> Go! <START> Kevin Costner. <START> Keanu Reeves. <START> John Candy. <START> Chloe Sevigny. <START> It's easy. <START> Taylor Kitsch, boys. <START> Big Riggins himself. <START> You picked Big Riggins, so I'll take Michael Fassbender, bro. <START> Yeah. <START> But if. <START> If Big Riggins, if he's not available, 'cause he's my number one, it's easy, Chad Michael Murray, boys. <START> Big Riggins is still my number one but I love Chaz Michael, bro. <START> One Tree Hill! <START> Boom! <START> Go with Michael Fassbender. <START> Try channeling that. <START> Choose Big Riggins. <START> You know what? <START> Actors named Michael could really reinvent themselves if they change their names to Spike, like uh, Spike Fassbenders or, uh, Spike Caine or Spike J. <START> Fox. <START> Spike Buble. <START> Chaz Spike Murray? <START> Oh, C. <START> Spike Murray? <START> Let's try and stay on task! <START> Well, now it might be kind of awkward, might be kind of awkward if actors named Richards started going by Dick. <START> Right? <START> Like Dick Gere. <START> Dick Pryor. <START> Dick Dreyfuss. <START> Lionel Dick. <START> Feel like Richard Simmons probably prefers Dick. <START> Dude, he got fucking mad. <START> Well, looks like she's back to cutting lawns. <START> All those for Wayne resuming presidency of the Ag Hall. <START> Can I get a one vote here? <START> We got one over here. <START> Now can I get a two? <START> Twodollar bill. <START> Two over here now can I get a three. <START> Looking at three, three over here, now can I get a four? <START> Looking for a four. <START> Wayne for President for four? <START> No four. <START> Three for Wayne. <START> Those for McMurray reclaiming presidency of the Ag Hall, can I get a one vote here, looking for onedollar bill. <START> We got one over here, one over here! <START> Now can I get a two, looking for a two, two over here! <START> Now can I get a three, looking at a three? <START> Three over here, we're looking at three, can I get a four, looking for a four. <START> Four over here, now can I get a five? <START> Fivedollar bill, looking for a five. <START> Five over here, now can I get a six? <START> Six dollars, looking for a six, six over here! <START> Now can I get a seven? <START> Seven right here, you can tell by the way he uses his walk he's a woman's man. <START> Sold! <START> Majority rules. <START> Presidency awarded to McMurray. <START> Come on, baby. <START> Come here. <START> Yeah, yeah, yeah! <START> Okay. <START> You gotta act classy. <START> Now you're the First Lady. <START> McMurray, Mrs. <START> McMurray, congratulations. <START> Thanks, Wayne. <START> P'zazz is all cleared up and everything. <START> I'm back to my old self again. <START> Glad to hear. <START> Best of luck. <START> Appreciate it. <START> Let's go get a couple of cocksucking G&Ts, that's what I always say. <START> Okay, girl, let's do it. <START> Sorry, I couldn't vote for you, Wayne. <START> Your video really threw me off. <START> Thanks for cutting my lawn, though. <START> I'll return the favor one day. <START> Good enough, Jim. <START> Stewart's <START> YouTube page. <START> McMurray's a piece of shit. <START> McMurray's a piece of shit. <START> McMurray's a piece of shit? <START> Why would I say McMurray's a piece of shit? <START> All right, he's a piece of shit. <START> Hello? <START> Yo. <START> What's up, B? <START> Nothing. <START> Chilling. <START> What's up with you?

<START> What the fuck is that, boys? <START> Yo, you leave the house like that, buddy? <START> What's the problem, Schmelt? <START> You got a fucking bush, bud. <START> You got a bush, bud. <START> Who's the bush inspector around here, boys? <START> Bush inspector's sleeping on shift, boys. <START> On our junior team it's a fivedollar fine every game and praccy 'til she's shaved down to the wood, boys. <START> Hey, get that hedge hog off your tummy stick, bud. <START> You're fucking gross, bud. <START> You're fucking gross, bud. <START> Looks like we got a couple of cocklookers, <START> Yorkie. <START> Of course, the Schmelts like a good cocklook, Barts. <START> Oh, yeah, I fucking cocklooked 'cause your junk's a fucking car crash and you can't look away. <START> I cocklooked 'cause your junk's a fucking strobe light. <START> I can see it with my eyes closed! <START> So you were cocklooking. <START> They just admitted they cocklooked. <START> Well, I cocklooked 'cause your junk's a fucking welding flame, buddy. <START> You look directly at it and your fucking retinas getting burned. <START> I cocklooked because your junk's a fucking child walking in on his parents. <START> Once you see it, it cannot be unseen. <START> All this time cocklooking could be better spent doing legs. <START> More legs, less cocklooking, Schmelts. <START> I fucking skipped leg day, boys. <START> Fuck leg day, boys! <START> You are woefully uninformed, aren't you? <START> How? <START> I said I would beat Devon's view count, not win you the election. <START> And guess what? <START> I did beat Devon's view count. <START> Look. <START> Oh, I don't give a care. <START> I've been contacted by Budweiser and Carl's Jr. over copyright infringements, but I don't think they're serious. <START> You wanna know what? <START> McMurray's meetings are a bit painful, but not sure that's good enough reason to get into politics. <START> They're all crooks. <START> Every one of them. <START> Now run along, Stewart, before I get bored of behaving. <START> Well, I guess she's off to chore. <START> Been busy cutting other people's fucking lawns all week. <START> Jim Dickins. <START> How're ya now? <START> It's Dicks. <START> Nope, you got it right that time. <START> Good n' you? <START> Not so bad. <START> I said I'd return the favor for cutting the lawn. <START> I figured there's no time like the present. <START> Can we give you a hand with anything?
