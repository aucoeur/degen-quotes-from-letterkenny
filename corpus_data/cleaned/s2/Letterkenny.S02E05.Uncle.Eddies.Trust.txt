<START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Well, get after it. <STOP> <START> Isn't this already a reality series? <STOP> <START> If it is, no one watches it. <STOP> <START> Well, I'd fucking watch it, boy howdy. <STOP> <START> I'll have the girls perform campy tasks and complete silly challenges to prove their mettle. <STOP> <START> Well, that sounds fun. <STOP> <START> Unnecessary, but go on. <STOP> <START> Then you'd go on group dates with them and oneonone dates with them. <STOP> <START> And then you ax them one by one until you decide which one you want to marry. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> I'm not sure it's reasonable that he could choose a wife based just on that. <STOP> <START> I know. <STOP> <START> Tastes good, but where's the cream filling? <STOP> <START> Like a Boston cream? <STOP> <START> Canadian maple's better. <STOP> <START> Well, that's a Texassized 104. <STOP> <START> Here's the kicker. <STOP> <START> When it gets down to the final three girls, deal is, you get to go to their houses and meet their families. <STOP> <START> See? <STOP> <START> Now that's reasonable. <STOP> <START> And then you get to spend a night with each of them, until you decide which one you want to marry. <STOP> <START> Is that. <STOP> <START> Does she. <STOP> <START> With all three? <STOP> <START> Does she mean. <STOP> <START> After the. <STOP> <START> Well, maybe it means that I would have to. <STOP> <START> I don't want to talk about it, just ask her. <STOP> <START> Okay, I'll ask her. <START> You want to know what? <STOP> <START> I got some fucking questions here. <STOP> <START> Shaboink! <STOP> <START> Now, when you say I spend the night with three of them, is it implied I have sex with all three of them? <STOP> <START> Sure is. <STOP> <START> So, I meet their families. <STOP> <START> Then we go have sex. <STOP> <START> I do that with three of them, before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do the girls know going into the process that I will be having sex with them and two other girls before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> Maybe more. <STOP> <START> And do the girls' families, who I've just met, also know, going into the process, that I will be having sex with their daughters, as well as two other girls who are not their daughters, before deciding which one I want to marry? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And the girls, and their families, find this process entirely rational, despite how selfharming, healthhazardous, and humiliating it very likely will be? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> And do you say 20 girls, and their families will happily sign up for this process? <STOP> <START> Over and over, I imagine. <STOP> <START> Oh, Gail, I don't want to date a girl like that, for fuck's sake. <STOP> <START> Comes from a family like that. <STOP> <START> Fuck. <STOP> <START> Gail, could there be a female version where there's one girl and 20 dudes? <START> Yeah. <STOP> <START> I'm in. <STOP> <START> No! <STOP> <START> Ew! <START> You're out. <STOP> <START> And do you want to know what? <STOP> <START> What? <STOP> <START> I'm out. <STOP> <START> Okay. <STOP> <START> Up next in the barn, this husband and wife pair from RR2 Letterkenny wants to go hunting for buried treasure. <STOP> <START> Bonnie! <STOP> <START> Bonnie! <STOP> <START> Did ya feed the dog?

<STOP> <START> That's unclear. <STOP> <START> But a dam's got to get blowed up. <STOP> <START> I'm surprised we're not blowing up beaver dams right now. <STOP> <START> This is a choice idea, boys. <STOP> <START> And one that definitely no one has ever attempted before. <STOP> <START> I think I'm in. <STOP> <START> What could go wrong? <STOP> <START> And after we grows our brand and got a followings, we could use our influences to condemn homosexuals. <STOP> <START> Oh. <STOP> <START> No, no, 'cause. <STOP> <START> It's okay because, you know, once we've created our brand, and then condemned the homosexuals, we'll just like go home with our families to eat supper and then hold hands and pray. <STOP> <START> Well, see now, that's a wee bit of a curve ball, superchieftains. <STOP> <START> What do you have against homosexuals?
