Wait, does Stewart get points for opening Katy's door? <START> Johnny Cash could have stepped out of that shit box and I'd still say, "Why is it not clean?" Well, should we jump into Dary's shit box and go to the <START> Ags Hall? <START> Now, I know McMurray's meetings can be a bits of a chore. <START> Even worse when Mrs. <START> McMurray's there. <START> But the <START> Ags Hall is as much ours as anyone else's, and we should be there for the important decisionsmaking. <START> Squirrelly Dan, you'll be snoring within the first five and I'd bet as many bucks on it. <START> Well, I had my coffee today so I will takes that bet. <START> You don't need to shake, I trust ya. <START> It's 'cause I cupafart, isn't it?. <START> That was a very productive first hour and 45 minutes, I must say. <START> On to item number 29 of 39. <START> Yep! <START> It's still item number 28, baby. <START> Item 28 is a twopart item. <START> Huh! <START> Thank you, darlin'. <START> MRS. <START> You're welcome, baby. <START> All right, on to item 28, part B. <START> I, McMurray, motion that the front weather mat be changed, from a Remington charcoal, fourfoot by eightfoot by threemillimeter thick rubber doormat, to a raisin charcoal threefoot by sixfoot by threemillimeter thick ribbed vinyl boot tray. <START> It came in a gainsboro grey also, which is a pale tone of grey. <START> That's correct. <START> It also came in puce. <START> Puce is a warm grey, tonally. <START> Grey tones don't clean up as well as dark tones. <START> Hence, the raisin charcoal. <START> Better look goddamn clean after you're done cleanin' the cocksucker, that's what I always say.   Mmmhmm. <START> Would a member second my motion? <START> I second, baby.  I second so hard. <START> Thank you, baby, I knew you'd second the shit right out of it. <START> Dan!  Daniel. <START> Mm, he's a real deep sleeper. <START> Oh, super deep. <START> Like he fell asleep at the IM<START> AX during Transformers 2. <START> Fell asleep riding the back of a garbage truck one time. <START> Intolerable. <START> Daniel! <START> Do you know dogs sleep for 80% of their lives? <START> You wanna know what? <START> He might be faking it. <START> He's faking it. <START> Oh, he's faking it. <START> I can see he's faking it. <START> Are you faking it, Dan? <START> Look, I can see one of his eyes are open.  Yeah, he's faking it. <START> Daniel! <START> Don't touch it, it hurts. <START> You better cut out all that goddamn snoring before I stuff a cocksuckin' work sock down your skull cave. <START> Keep going, baby. <START> Everybody's listening. <START> Everybody loves you. <START> Thank you, darlin'. <START> You better listen to her, Daniel. <START> Now, I'm sure you no doubt have all noticed that we are down to one dozen coat hangers in the front hall. <START> There are approximately twelve dozen in the rear hall. <START> All standard steel wire, baby? <START> All standard steel wire in a flattened triangular shape. <START> I, McMurray, motion that one dozen be transported to the front hall. <START> K. <START> Wayne. <START> Wayne, Wayne, Wayne. <START> Wayne. <START> Wayne. <START> Wayne. <START> Look at me, Wayne. <START> Wayne. <START> There is a tried, tested and true system at work here. <START> And, as President of the <START> Agricultural Hall, I must demand it be respected. <START> One member makes a motion. <START> Then another member then seconds that motion. <START> Second, K. <START> K is not a second. <START> Well, it's the second time I said "K". <START> So you second my motion? <START> You want to know what? <START> I'm all out of seconds, bud. <START> So it's not a second? <START> Well, this is taking too many seconds is what I'm saying. <START> Well, you only have to second once. <START> All right, give me a second. <START> So are you saying that you second or that you need a second? <START> Well, one second. <START> All right. <START> Wayne, you shall be given one second. <START> Whilst Wayne is taking one second. <START> I second the fuckin' motion, McMurray! <START> Now move the fuckin' coat hangers! <START> Well, thank you, Wayne. <START> Let the secretary note that I, McMurray, motioned to move one dozen coat hangers. <START> I'll move the fuckin' coat hangers myself. <START> Can't sit around here all fucking day with my horn in my hands. <START> Got chorin' to do, for fuck's sake. <START> Would the secretary note that aforementioned coat hangers have such been moved. <START> Thanks to a very overzealous beaver. <START> There's order, people, and it must be followed. <START> Concluded! <START> Item 30 of 39. <START> Wayne. <START> Jim Dickins. <START> How're ya now? <START> Good'n you? <START> Not so bad. <START> Wayne, 100% bullshit 'round here. <START> Got a bidder now, one. <START> Lookin' at two. <START> Two, and now at lookin' at three. <START> Three hundred now, can I get a four? <START> Four there now, sold. 400% bullshit 'round here. <START> Well, it's never so bad it couldn't be worse. <START> Worse than 400% sounds an awful lot to me like five. 500%, now lookin' at six. 600%, lookin' at seven. 700%, can I get an eight? <START> Sold. 800% bullshit 'round here. <START> Well, meetings run a Chair long but it's important business so. <START> If someone doesn't do something about this bullshit soon. <START> We'll be at nine. 900%, now lookin' at 10. <START> Ten over there, now lookin' at 11. <START> Can I get a 12. <START> All right. <START> All right, cool it. <START> What would you have him do, there, Jim? <START> If Wayne runs for <START> Ag Hall president, I'll give him. <START> One vote right here, looking at one, we got one vote here, and lookin' to get two. <START> Well, see, now that sounds a bit dramatic to me, Jim. <START> No. <START> I don't think that's such a bad idea. <START> Did that not sound a bit dramatic to you? <START> I'd back that. <START> Well, it's bloody Shakespearean. <START> It'd be usurpin' the throne. <START> I'd back that like a spinal cord. <START> It just sounds dramatic to me. <START> Jim! <START> Tell you what, Jim. <START> I'll think on it. <START> Have a good one. <START> Have a good one, Jim. <START> One little birdie bird flying in the sky. <START> We got two little birds and we're lookin' at three. <START> Three little birdies, now we're lookin' at four. <START> Why do birds suddenly appear every time I auctioneer?. <START> Just a series of bad bounces for a couple of stick and pucksters, bud. <START> Not getting the bounces, bro. <START> Cut from the Letterkenny Shamrocks in our overage year, bud. <START> No victory lap for the Shammy's, bro. <START> No victory lap, ferda. <START> Ferda. <START> And no Katy. <START> KatyKat stepped out. <START> Twotimed. <START> Played around. <START> Caught a matinee. <START> Carried on. <START> You know, I should be mad, but I'm just sort of. <START> Sad. <START> Give your balls a tug, you tit fucker! <START> Not gonna miss playing with Shoresy, though, bud. <START> Always a silver lining, buddy. <START> You know, bud, he's right. <START> Game faces on, it's our first day of senior hockey, bud. <START> Well, first impression's a lasting one, bro. <START> Are you ready for this, bud?

<START> She's being punished. <START> Why? <START> She tried to kill her stud again. <START> That's my girl. <START> Why? <START> Well, fucked if I know, Dan. <START> It's supposed to be natural for animals to want to breed. <START> And fucked if those pups wouldn't be as beautiful as she is. <START> She was a beautiful pup. <START> She's a beautiful dog. <START> She was a gorgeous pup. <START> Well, she's a gorgeous dog. <START> But why is she in her pen? <START> It's 'cause aggression's to be discouraged. <START> It's like Cesar Millan says, exercise, discipline and affection, in that order. <START> I'd have a Bloody Caesar. <START> Do you wanna know what? <START> I'd have a Caesar, too. <START> I could have a Caesar if you guys are havin' Caesars. <START> Hard to see a Caesar and not want a Caesar. <START> That's actually how they market Caesars. <START> You should call up Gail over at her Bed and Biscuits. <START> I bet ya she's got some studs for Stormy. <START> Well, better to let the dust settle on Modean's burndown before I bug her. <START> We need a new bar in this town. <START> But why's Stormy trying to kill all her studs?
